            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8608484">Mr. Speaker, the House of Commons has been ground to a halt for over two weeks because the Liberal government refuses to comply with an order of the House to permit the distribution of the documents concerning a $400-million corruption scandal. These are heights we have not seen in quite some time, with a scandal of epic proportions. The Liberals have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the public, the RCMP and the House do not gain access to the critical documents that would show what really went on in this so-called green slush fund scandal, which I will get into momentarily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608485">It is really important to note that the Auditor General of Canada, which is a non-partisan auditor of the House and of government spending, found that there was almost $400 million in misused taxpayer money, as well as, notably, 186 conflicts of interest for nine board members from this green slush fund. There were nine people who had 186 conflicts of interest, totalling about $400 million. The House has been ground to a halt because the Liberals refuse to reveal the documents that you yourself, Mr. Speaker, and the House ordered them to distribute, and they failed to comply. They have used a whole magnitude of different excuses. In fact, they cannot quite seem to get their story straight in terms of why they do not want to give those documents to Parliament as it has ordered, and we will get into that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608486">All parliamentary business has been ground to a halt for two weeks because of the refusal to comply. I want to talk a bit about what exactly went down at this green slush fund. It is quite interesting, and the tendrils into Liberal insiders go quite deep.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608487">What we have been calling the green slush fund refers to something now defunct, a foundation of government called Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC. It was a foundation set up by a previous Liberal government in 2001; in essence, its purpose was to provide taxpayer funds to green technology. It has since carried on for a number of decades, and it is now defunct. It is just another foundation, another group, another organization that is in the graveyard of Liberal corruption. It is another fatality of Liberal insider behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608488">The government of the day appoints a number of the board members for this fund, as we will call it. Certainly, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would have signed off on a number of the board members from the cabinet discussion, and that is important to remember. The Prime Minister appointed many of the board members on this fund. After the Liberal government was elected in 2015, things really took a turn in this foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608489">The Auditor General of Canada found that the Liberal government turned this foundation into what is, in essence, a slush fund, where Liberal insiders appointed to the board funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars to their own companies, into their own pockets. This totalled $400 million, with 186 conflicts of interest proven by the Auditor General. That is what we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608490">Just to get into a few more details, the Auditor General found that the fund gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that did not fall under the scope of what the fund was supposed to provide. They should not have received a penny, let alone almost $60 million. Of course, there was $334 million given to projects where board members had conflicts of interest. Notably, nine of the directors of the board had these 186 conflicts. They were very busy during the few years they were on that board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608491">Again, $58 million went to projects without ensuring contribution agreements were made. Not only were there conflicts of interest, but the Liberals were not even doing their due diligence on the ones who were not enriching themselves. It is just an utter mess. It shows no respect for the hard-earned taxpayer dollars the Liberals were just throwing out the door, with no regard for what it would mean to the ethical behaviour of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608492">The Auditor General did quite interesting work here. Over a five-year period, there were 405 transactions approved by the board. The Auditor General sampled 226 transactions, so just over half, and found 186 conflicts, which ultimately works out to 82%. Therefore, 82% of the transactions she looked at were conflicts in which someone benefited from their own decision to sign over money. She made it very clear in her report that the blame for this scandal falls on the Liberal government's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who “did not sufficiently monitor” the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608493">Again, this fund was responsible for almost a billion dollars, but, according to the Liberals, they were not really paying attention. It is as if a billion dollars is the sort of change we would find in the bottom of a Liberal pocket and nothing to really be concerned about. Of course, now they have ground the House to a halt for two weeks because they are so concerned about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608494"> I want to talk a bit about some of the conflicts of interest that were found. They are quite interesting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608495">There was a board member named Andrée-Lise Méthot. She was appointed to the green slush fund in 2016. She runs a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital. We should remember that name. It is in the green technology field. I believe it is some sort of venture capital investment fund that gets investment dollars from government and elsewhere and then invests in other green technology companies and the like. Before and during Ms. Méthot's time on the board, her company received a quarter of a billion dollars in grants from the green slush fund to Cycle Capital. Some of that was before she was on the board, but while she was on the board, $114 million went to green companies that she had herself invested in. She personally approved this, enriching herself. She was appointed by the Liberals. Interestingly, during her time on the board, the value of Cycle Capital tripled. Again, it certainly pays to be a Liberal insider. It is no wonder; with a stamp of approval from the federal government, a company has gravitas, showing that it is a trustworthy company in a certain sense. Others can invest in it because the federal government has. Therefore, with these investments from taxpayers through the green slush fund, her company tripled in value. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608496">I want to talk about some of the lobbyists for Cycle Capital because members may be familiar with them. I am sure we know who the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> is for the Liberal government. He is quite a notable or notorious, whichever word we choose to describe him, member of the Liberal cabinet. Before he was elected, he lobbied the Prime Minister's Office and the Department of Industry 25 times for Cycle Capital. At that time, Cycle Capital received $111 million. To his full credit, the minister was a very successful lobbyist for this company. Of course, when he was part of the company, he received shares for Cycle Capital, which he still holds today. That is good for him because the shares of that company have tripled in value in that time. It sure pays to be a Liberal insider. Again, it is reasonable to assume that he has made quite a bit of money. However, I think that what is very odd for taxpayers is the idea that a person can lobby the government dozens of times, bring in millions of dollars to a company, get elected and be at the cabinet table where these appointments are approved. Then, the people they know and used to lobby for go into this green slush fund and funnel more money to that company, and the shares in that company triple in value. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608497">If any of the Canadians or Québécois watching are thinking about how they can get ahead in this economy, I do not know about other members, but I would say that all they have to do is start a tech company. As long as they are Liberal insiders, they can get hundreds of millions of dollars from the Liberal government. We are all in the wrong business if we want to get ahead in this country under the Liberals; they are doing a very good job lining their own pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608498">What is more interesting is that Ms. Méthot, the head of Cycle Capital, left the green slush fund in 2022 and went on to another Liberal board, the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which members will be very familiar with. It is ultimately a failed board that has taken in billions of dollars to build infrastructure. I do not believe it has completed one project in the almost 10 years that the government has been in power and has been talking about this Infrastructure Bank. It has had a whole host of problems, such as CEOs coming and going. However, Ms. Méthot went over to that one after she approved all that money for her own company and others that she had financial interests in. While she was at the Infrastructure Bank, she voted to give $170 million to a company owned by the recent chair, Annette Verschuren, who was appointed to the green slush fund by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are all connected, these folks, all the Liberal insiders. It is a great little rich party of people taking a lot of taxpayer money. That is what I found when researching this topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608499">Annette Verschuren was found guilty of giving her own company money when she was on that board. We had both the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner of Canada saying that this was not good. The Ethics Commissioner found Ms. Verschuren guilty of breaking ethics law; again, this is a running theme with the Liberal government. We know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself was found guilty twice. Other Liberal ministers were also found guilty. Their friend, whom they appointed to the green slush fund, funnelled money from taxpayer dollars to her own company and, ultimately, was found guilty of doing so by the Ethics Commissioner. She broke the law. Her company also received $12 million from other government funds and $50 million from Natural Resources Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8608500"> When people ask how the Conservatives are going to fix the budget, this is how: The gravy train will come to an end for Liberal insiders. We are talking about $400 million. That is a good place to save taxpayers some money and look to balance the books. This happens time and time again. This is, by far, not the first time we are talking about a misuse of taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608501"> There really are a number of these very shady individuals, or maybe they are good individuals; they are certainly good at getting money for themselves when they get appointed to this board. There is another guy I will talk about just briefly because he is interesting. Guy Ouimet was on the board, and he admitted in committee testimony that $17 million of green slush fund money went to companies in which he held financial interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608502"> What was really interesting about this is that these people are so rich they do not even understand what $17 million is. He said that it was a small amount of money. Meanwhile, we have two million Canadians going to food banks, and Liberal insiders are saying, “Well, it's just a small amount of money. I don't know what the big deal is.” It is quite embarrassing. The value of that company, since it got government funds, went up 1,000%. It sure pays to be a Liberal insider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608503">How about the green slush fund director, Stephen Kukucha? He is from British Columbia. He was a political staffer to a former Liberal environment minister. He was also an organizer for the Liberal Party for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in British Columbia. As a reward, he got a board appointment to this green slush fund. During his time on the board, companies he held financial interest in received $5 million. Again, at committee, he also said, “That's just a small amount of money, not a big deal.” I am laughing because it is just so outrageous that millions of dollars would be seen as not a big deal. Again, it pays to be a Liberal insider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608504">We know Liberals are using a lot of different excuses for why they should not have to obey an order from Parliament. I wanted to get into a few of them. They talk about how the idea that Parliament will compel documents that may have the names of all the other people who have received money, which may really bring to light the magnitude of this beyond even what we know from the Auditor General, is a violation of their charter rights. Demanding the documents might hold people accountable for possibly defrauding the government or bringing corruption into the government, but there is the idea that Canadians have no right to know how taxpayer dollars were funnelled into these people's pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608505"> If their names are on those papers and they are found to have defrauded the government, then they should be held accountable. That is really what this whole place is about. The reason we are not a dictatorship is not just that we go to the ballot box every few years and get to freely choose our governments, but it is also that we have a system of democratic principles, rules and procedures that hold power accountable. Ultimately, Parliament is supreme, and Parliament has ruled, demanded and ordered the production of these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608506"> Again, what we are debating is that the privilege of the House was violated because the Liberal government refuses to hand over all the documents. Of those that they did hand over, many were blacked out, or redacted. Ultimately, the rules that govern parliamentary privilege are constitutionally on par with the charter. If Parliament rules that we need to see those documents, the Liberal government has to comply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608507"> I found that argument interesting. It almost seems as if the Liberals sort of default to saying “the charter” whenever they are in trouble, as if the charter is supposed to protect Liberals from their own corruption. I do not think so. The debate will go on and on in this place until they obey the ruling of the House and, ultimately, of the Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608508"> Andrew Coyne actually said this really well today in The Globe and Mail. He said, “The right of Parliament to send for ‘persons, paper and things’ is one of the most ancient...parliamentary privileges. It is crucial to the Commons' ability to act as a check on the executive.” Again, the thing that is keeping us from a dictatorship is the fact that we have checks and balances on power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608509"> I would ask that the Liberals be reminded that they have a constitutional responsibility to the checks on power that we apply to them. That is the reason we are all here. If they do not have to obey an order of Parliament, we might as well all just pack up and go home. We might as well let the Liberals be a dictatorship in which they can decide whatever they want. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8608510">The opposition parties in the House, collectively, are demanding these documents. The Liberals have a minority government, so they have to comply. The Speaker has ruled this. I do find that that argument is quite a dangerous territory for the Liberals. What are they suggesting? Are they suggesting that we have no rights as parliamentarians? Then what are we doing here?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608511">They go on and on. They are using tons of different excuses. One of the ones I found funny is when they say that this fund existed under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, so how could we be criticizing it? The Auditor General herself looked at the green slush fund back in 2017, before it was a slush fund, and gave it a clean bill of health. Under Harper, it was well managed, but as soon the Liberals started to appoint the board members, that is when it went downhill. That is when Ms. Verschuren came into the picture and funnelled money to herself. She was found guilty of violating ethics laws, which is a running theme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608512">Before I conclude, I want to talk a bit about how the Liberals really do not have a leg to stand on. Even if this were the first time, it is unbelievable that we are talking about $400 million and the Liberals somehow do not have to give up the documents that Parliament has ordered. However, it is not the first time. This is a running pattern in the last nine years. I would like to talk about a few of those other instances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608513">Right when I was first elected, it was the WE Charity scandal. Do members remember that? It feels like a very long time ago, but that was a $1-billion scandal, where Liberals looked to give one billion taxpayer dollars to what was found to be quite a slimy organization that, prior to getting that $1 billion, promoted the Liberals at length, particularly the Trudeau family. The organization paid them money for various appearances. The former finance minister, Bill Morneau, was given a free trip, and I think his daughter received some sort of benefit. Therefore, a very tight-knit, almost fangirl-level organization to the Trudeau family was given $1 billion. That got so heated that summer that the Liberals prorogued Parliament just to avoid it, so maybe that is coming. Let us watch for that. If the Liberal government prorogues Parliament, then we know we have almost got them on something of true corruption because the same thing happened back in 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608514">Then, the following summer in 2021, we had the Winnipeg lab documents. For the first time in a century, an individual was called to the bar because Liberals were so desperate to avoid revealing the Winnipeg lab documents. There were two scientists from the Chinese Communist Party working in a high-ranking Winnipeg lab, who looked to be taking very secret information from Canada and who were marched out of that building. There were all these documents about it. The Liberals were so desperate to stop the public from finding out, they called a snap election. Therefore, they do not have a leg to stand on when they say, “We did nothing wrong. There is nothing to see here,” because we have seen this before. In fact, I could probably go on another 20 minutes about all the ethics violations of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608515">We, of course, remember the Aga Khan's billionaire island. Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> loves his tropical vacations, and in December 2017, the Ethics Commissioner found he had violated ethics laws by taking a very hoity-toity fancy trip to a billionaire's tropical island with his family. That was just the first time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608516"> Members will remember as well the second time, which was SNC-Lavalin. It was quite the scandal. The brave Jody Wilson-Raybould spoke out against the corruption she saw going on with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He was found guilty of breaking an ethics law at that time. He was inappropriately pressuring the Attorney General. It was a very serious matter. In fact, the election that came a few months later was when the Prime Minister lost his majority and never recovered. The public has been really starting to see what is going on here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608517"> We talk about $1 billion, $400 million and all these big numbers. What does that really mean to an individual person? I have a difficult time understanding how much $1 billion is. It is just such a shockingly high number. If we look at it, the average Canadian earns about $58,000 a year. Some earn more, and some earn less, but the average is about $58,000. In a two-parent household with two average incomes, that family pays, on average, about $18,000 in federal income tax. They work months of the year away from their families. They have to deal with office politics and all kinds of things to go to work. They have to pay their bills and support the public services, so they pay about $18,000 in federal taxes. Do members know how many families have to work an entire year to pay federal income tax so that Liberal insiders can enrich themselves with $390 million? Twenty-two thousand Canadian families had to work their butts off so Liberals could line their own pockets. That is unacceptable, and we are going to hold them accountable for it.</ParaText>

Without these powers to hold the executive accountable, we would be a dictatorship, so I am not sure if that is what they are advocating for, but we are fulfilling our duty here, and they should remember that.</ParaText>

Considering the powers of this place, and the Speaker's ruling, the Liberals have failed to supply the documents as they have been ordered to do. However, as soon as they get another party to support them, this can come to an end, and our ability to hold them accountable on this, on principle, will come to an end in that regard. It is important, and I would ask the NDP to stay firm on this. They are an opposition party. We have to ensure that we are continuing to bring this to light.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608538">Our House leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, did an excellent speech on the ancient parliamentary tradition that we have, which is what really provides the power of the opposition to hold the government accountable. He quoted quite an interesting book, <I>The Power of Parliamentary Houses to Send for Persons, Papers and Records</I>, and he really summed it up quite nicely. It reads, “Based on principles firmly established in constitutional parliamentary law...a House of parliament has the full authority to summon and compel the production of any document.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608544"> Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand in debate to speak for the first time to the very important motion and question of parliamentary privilege before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608545">Just as a bit of background, why are we here today? What are we debating? Basically, due to whistle-blower testimony from public servants, the Auditor General found that there were irregularities in the awarding of government grants with Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC. Specifically, Liberal-appointed members of the board were awarded at least $330 million in 186 cases of conflict of interest and paid out another $59 million to companies without authorization, totalling approximately $389 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608546">The Auditor General made it very clear that the issue falls under the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister of industry</Affiliation>, who “did not sufficiently...monitor” the contracts that were given to insiders. The House of Commons supported the Conservative motion that called on the government, the SDTC and the Auditor General to hand over all the documents related to the scandal to the RCMP within 14 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608547">The Liberal government refused to adhere to the will of Parliament and of Canadians. It has yet to hand over the documents to the RCMP. We can only assume that this is presumably to cover up the scandal. You ruled, Mr. Speaker, that this failure to adhere to the will of Parliament has constituted a breach of privilege, and therefore all business in the House is stalled until the Liberal government complies with your order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608548"> I will give a little bit more background for viewers and listeners back home. The key mandate of SDTC was to federally fund non-profits, to approve and disperse over $100 million in funds annually to clean-technology companies. That was a very important role, something that had been ongoing for almost decades, I believe. It had a clean bill of health up until, I believe, the 2017-2018 time frame. It was an arm's-length body, not for profit, and was supposed to create and support projects that develop and demonstrate new technologies that address issues related to climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608549">However, there were problems, some of which I have already highlighted. The executive appointees were awarded projects that had conflicts of interest. They all started around 2019 under the then Liberal industry minister, Navdeep Bains. He began appointing conflicted executives to the board, and then those board members began voting for companies in which the executives themselves had active conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608550">The Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner initiated and conducted separate investigations. This is when a number of whistle-blowers came forward and the Auditor General found a severe lack in governance standards and uncovered the scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608551">I will get to the crux of the matter. Mr. Speaker, you ordered that the documents be turned over. The power of the House is greater than any one act, yet unfortunately the PCO decided to tell the departments to redact the documents. As a result, in our view and in your own view, there was a breach of our privileges. That is why we are debating today. That is the background.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608552"> I want to take a slightly different approach for the remainder of my speech. I thought that if I were going to give a speech on this, I should ask my constituents for their feedback. I am here at the behest of 115,000 constituents in Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound. I decided that I would send an email out to them and hopefully get back some interesting feedback. I sent that out just Wednesday afternoon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608553">As of nine o'clock this morning, I had received 436 email responses back giving feedback on the issue, 210 in the first four hours alone, 357 within the first 12 hours and the remainder since. I asked just two simple questions. Those who follow me on social media know that I am not the biggest social media person. I do not have a massive following, but about 5,000 constituents in my riding subscribe to a monthly e-newsletter that I put out, and those were the people to whom the questions were sent out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608554"> I asked two simple questions. The first was whether the Liberal government should turn over the SDTC documents to the House and to the RCMP and comply with your will, Mr. Speaker. The second was whether any of the Liberal insiders who are found guilty of illegitimately receiving the funds should have to pay the money back to the taxpayers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608555">I am going to read some of the responses into the record. There are dozens I could not use because the language did not meet the parliamentary language standard. Hopefully the ones I have put in my speech do, but I will do my best. I may have to think on my feet and paraphrase some of the comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608556">Brian from Meaford said, “The Liberal government must turn over the SDTC documents to the RCMP for their criminal investigation and comply with Parliament's will. The Liberal insiders who were awarded contracts through the SDTC by illegitimate means must repay the grant money they received to taxpayers.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608557">Carol in Owen Sound said, “Yes, I feel that the Liberal government should hand over the documents. Not doing so in a timely manner only leads us to assume their guilt. Yes, insiders awarded contracts illegitimately should have to pay back any monies received.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608558"> Hillary from Owen Sound said, “Yes...and this isn't the first time this government has been caught in a scandal and giving our tax dollars to insiders and friends; i.e. the WE scandal comes to mind but I know there were more.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608559">Janet said, “I do believe they should have to turn over documents and be treated like anyone else in the country. If they broke the law they need to be punished just like anyone else. Yes, I think they should have to pay back all the money. All Liberals know how to do is take our tax dollars and line their own pockets while people drown and lose everything they have.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608560">Bob said, “I have watched all the committee videos where these fraud-related matters were discussed including that with the very credible whistle-blower. I look forward to your pressing Parliament to take action on the points raised. House of Commons debates are very interesting currently as the government tries various smear tactics.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608561">Gladys said, “Yes to both questions. I am tired of Governments never considering whose money they are using. They were voted in by the taxpayers, but feel they can spend that money without giving careful consideration to how that money is being spent. We the taxpayers are the employers, if you will, and the government the employees. Therefore, your ‘bosses’ are telling you to have more consideration concerning the spending of our money. It is not yours to be careless with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608562">“I am almost 75 years old and I am tired of always having to watch my spending while governments just seem to throw it away. Why bother voting these people in, [just to] have the taxpayers' and citizens' best interest [ignored].”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608563">That is really important, and one of my points when I conclude will be that the risk we have when the government is not complying with the will of Parliament and the Speaker's ruling is that it is undermining the trust Canadians have in our democratic institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608564">I will continue with the quotes. Bryan said, “In my opinion, all political parties in our Canadian government, whether they are the governing party or parties in opposition, must be transparent in their dealings with Parliament, with the other political parties and most importantly in their dealings with third parties whether at arm's length or not, especially when dealing with government...monies. Therefore the SDTC documents must be turned over to the RCMP immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608565">“Any illegitimate contracts must be returned to the Canadian people immediately as well. You can remind everyone just how quickly all the hard-working people were threatened if they did not return any CERB overpayments they received during the COVID crisis.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608566">Warren said, “I have been a purchasing agent for 30 years and I have never seen such blatant corruption in our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608567">“No one, and I mean no one, would be able to get away with this in the private sector.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608568">Stephen said, “First of all, all documents need to be turned over immediately. I am very familiar with working in these environments and with process and procedures. I have been personally certified for government contracts within the secrecy act and understand completely the mess that has been created here, and in many respects, how basic it is to follow common sense guidelines, rules, regulations, etcetera. You may not like the more stringent requirements, but they are there for a reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608569"> “One only has to look at ArriveCAN. How much more of a mess do we need to see? How do we get from an $80-thousand app to $64 million spent? All funding granted to Liberal insiders needs to be returned to the government coffers and used for good and proper actions to benefit all taxpayers.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8608570">Don said, “The judicial system in [government] is slowly and continuously being eroded and these types of situations do not look good.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608571">Randy, and I do not know whether it is the “other Randy” or which Randy it is, said, “I do believe the government should hand over all material related to this matter, and also the members of the party that had knowledge of the illegal activities should be held accountable in so far as to say they should lose their jobs and pension. The Liberal insiders who received the money should be made to pay back every cent plus interest.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608572"> Meghan said, “I would say yes to both of your questions. If the Liberal government did nothing wrong, they should have no issues in handing over documentation that is being asked for. We should be able to trust the government that is running our country and they should be held accountable if there is wrongdoing. Any grants should be paid back in full if there was insider information involved.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608573">Greg said, “The fact that they are not turning over any and all related documentation as requested, and their transparent ploy to issue the documents in a redacted state, leaves every citizen with half a clue as to what is currently going on in our country with the distinct impression they are trying to hide a long-standing misuse if not outright theft of taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608574">“As my representative in Parliament, [talking about me,] I would fully expect you to use what ever pull you have within the party to hold them to account.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608575">This is from Richard: “Yes, absolutely, documents should be turned over. [The Prime Minister] promised in 2015 that his government would be fully transparent with Canadians, and to date I have not seen any transparency from this government, only scandal after scandal. It seems [the Prime Minister] and his government think they are above the law and somehow believe Canadians are happy with his performance This is unacceptable. What are they hiding?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608576">Peter said, “I have been following this scandal in the committee meetings and I am greatly concerned about the Liberals' actions, or in this case, lack thereof, with regard to handing over the documents. What are they hiding? This situation needs to be investigated thoroughly and those responsible should held to account, and if criminality is evident they should be charged. They are not above the law.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608577">This is from Les: “Certainly as a private business, if the government requests additional information for my personal tax audit, I have no option but to comply. They should be under that same requirement. If they're not trying to hide something, turning over that information shouldn’t be a big deal!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608578">Paul said, “This Liberal government does what it wants. Breaking laws, violating the Constitution, or, this time, breaching privilege, is business as usual for them. And they get away with it virtually every time with simply a slap on the wrist.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608579">Todd said, “The Liberal government that ran on being open and honest should be held accountable for their actions. The money that was given out should be returned and an investigation done by the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608580">“This is probably just the tip of the iceberg.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608581">Ryan said, “Over the past several years as more and more corruption has been discovered within our current government, it seems as though our parliamentary system is broken as no sitting members of this government have been held to account for their various breaches of trust.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608582">This is from Kevin: “I'd have to say that I am not at all surprised by this type of conduct.

              <ParaText id="8608583">“Like the Auditor General stated, there are numerous conflicts of interest. Our current Prime Minister seems to think rules only apply to others and not himself or his circle of friends and caucus members.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608584"> This is from Stephen: “My response is common sense and would be an absolute yes to both of your questions. I can’t believe we (Canadians) are dealing with items of this nature; it's a huge conflict of interest. Actually, it’s potentially criminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608585">“These ministers are acting like they were appointed weeks ago, and we both know this isn’t correct. They know it’s wrong, and if proven guilty they should be removed from their position.</ParaText>

Especially at a time when so many Canadians are suffering under ever-growing inflation, pushed even further by the growing carbon tax, it is of the utmost importance that taxpayer dollars be spent appropriately and recovered when we learn that they've been misused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608589">“The misconduct we've witnessed between the various SDTC misuses of money, the ArriveCAN scandal and the laundry list of fiscal irresponsibility and culture of lacking accountability in this Liberal government has permeated and metastasized within the bureaucracy of the federal public service. The negative examples at the top have done so much damage that there is an incredible amount of work to be done to rebuild public trust in our government infrastructure. Your motion is, at the very least, one step in the right direction.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608590"> Mary from Meaford said, “The Liberal government should turn over the SDTC documents to the RCMP...and comply with the will of Parliament. The Liberal insiders who are awarded contracts through the SDTC by illegitimate means should be ordered to repay the grant money they received to taxpayers.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608591">This is from Dave: “Both answers are yes. Accountability needs to be mandated, as the Liberals do not do it on their own. Repay the grants and, if there is availability, a penalty, either monetary or not being able to submit for contracts for a time specified or both.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608592"> Keith and Lisa from Owen Sound said, “Absolutely, yes to this question. If the Liberal government had nothing to hide, they would turn the documents over. As taxpayers, we have the right to know how and where our money is being spent. I would also agree that the Liberal insiders who received this money should pay it back. The current Liberal government has lacked transparency for quite some time on a number of issues. I appreciate the opportunity to share my voice in this matter.”</ParaText>

We're tired of the Liberals playing silly games for their benefit. We need to find the truth. We want accountability and if there are criminal charges involved, people should be charged. I will leave you to articulate in a manner you need to, but enough is enough. </ParaText>

I am also disappointed this measure has not been implemented by the people via our representatives in the House of Commons concerning other scandals we have seen in which the government failed to produce or only produced heavily redacted documents. My position is that we should turn over the documents to the law clerk then the RCMP. It is every citizen's duty, if they are aware of possible illegal activity, to report it with or without documentation to the police. The House of Commons is acting on behalf of the Canadian citizens and is engaged in the same process we are all to consider doing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608599">“If the Liberal government refuses to immediately hand over the requested information, this information should be seized by whatever force necessary by the RCMP or other appropriate agency. Those refusing to co-operate should be immediately released from their positions due to ethical, if not criminal, breaches. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608602">This is from Paul in Grey County: “Liberals are working against Canadian citizens, and the RCMP has a duty to investigate all the crimes and charge them. They also have to repay all the illegitimate money back.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608603">This is from Garnet: “This government is corrupt...and the people of Canada must remove them from power before our country becomes a totalitarian entity and democracy is dead.

Well, here could be the reason. This week, Canada's budget watchdog confirmed that the carbon tax will cost Ontario families another $903, in part due to the rising carbon tax on food.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608634">Nine years later, it is clear that nothing has been done. The Liberals once again dragged their feet and failed workers.

If a person's job is eliminated while they are on parental leave or soon after, that person no longer has access to regular benefits.

It is the single best mechanism known to the market to reduce carbon footprints. In fact, it was a Conservative invention. However, the Conservatives' opposition to it is unsurprising. What is surprising is the complete flip-flop on this position that we have seen from the NDP. When they flip on their principles and abandon supporting carbon pricing, they breed voter cynicism and they send one message to progressive voters, which is that if they want somebody to defend climate action and support attacking pollution, their only option is the Liberal Party of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608839">Mr. Speaker, Monday is Thanksgiving. What do I give thanks for? I give thanks for living in a democracy in which we draw a firm line between the police and politicians. That is a line that the Conservatives are asking us to cross. That is a line that the RCMP has flagged as being crossed as we speak. The RCMP has said, “in a free and democratic society [police independence] ensures that the government cannot direct or influence the actions of law enforcement”. That is a direct quote from the chief commissioner of the RCMP, Mike Duheme. I never thought I would have to say this in the House of Commons, but I wish that, for once, the Conservatives would listen to the cops.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608898">Mr. Speaker, people back at home in Langley, British Columbia, are asking me what is going on in Ottawa, why Parliament has come to a halt and what is the impasse so soon into the fall session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608899">The NDP tore up its supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals. What happened there? The NDP discovered that hitching its wagon to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s train was not really helping it very much where it really counts, which is at the polls. Nature abhors a vacuum, so the Bloc Québécois jumped in and started flirting with the Liberal government in the hope of maybe leveraging some favours. However, it too is finding out that being closely aligned with the Prime Minister in the waning days of his political career probably is not all that good as a political strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608900">Both these opposition parties are learning what has been obvious to the Conservative Party for a long time: the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has what resembles the opposite of a Midas touch. King Midas got his wish that everything he touched would turn to gold, which was really cool for a little while, until even his food started to turn into gold and he realized he would starve to death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608901">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has something similar; everything he touches gets tarnished. Eventually it falls apart in a pile of dust. Here are a couple of examples. The WE Charity was at one time a functional charity here in Canada. It had a very high profile. It worked with school kids. It had the additional advantage of being closely aligned with the Prime Minister, some of his cabinet ministers and some of their family members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608902">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thought he would reciprocate that friendship by selecting WE Charity, without any competition at all, to distribute almost $1 billion of COVID relief money. It was a short-lived golden moment for the charity, which ended when all the conflicts of interest became public. The harm was done and it shut its doors. It is history thanks to the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608903">SNC-Lavalin is another example. It was a profitable engineering and construction company with big projects right across the country and around the world. It made mistakes, admittedly, but if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had just left it alone, it would still be a thriving company today. His then attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada's first indigenous attorney general, had one idea, based on the professional advice she was getting, as to how to prosecute SNC-Lavalin. However, the Prime Minister had quite a different idea, so Canada's self-declared feminist prime minister fired Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada's female, first-ever indigenous attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608904">I read her autobiography, and I hope everyone has read it. It is very informative. In there, she said, quite frankly, that she wishes she had never met the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. She told him that to his face. There are many other people who have been too closely associated with the Prime Minister who feel the same.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608911"> Mr. Speaker, I was sharing some of travesties the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has wreaked upon great institutions and great people, like David Johnston, the former governor general of this country, a man with a huge reputation until the Prime Minister appointed him as special rapporteur on foreign interference in our elections, our democratic institutions. That appointment was made despite the close ties Mr. Johnston had with the Trudeau family and Trudeau Foundation, a foundation that had received funds from a foreign nation, which was going to be the subject of the investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608912">Maybe this obvious conflict of interest was not immediately obvious to our high school drama teacher <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but it certainly should have been obvious to highly educated David Johnston. Unfortunately, he did not get it, he did not understand it or he turned a blind eye to it. In the end, he resigned, another fatality of the Prime Minister's golden touch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608913">I could go on with other examples. I could mention the Winnipeg lab affair, the ArriveCAN scam or the billionaire island scandal. Some of my colleagues have raised those already. I am not going to belabour the point other than to relate this back to the question of the day: What happened to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, better known now by its new nickname, the Liberal Party green slush fund? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608914">I will provide a little history. SDTC was created by an act of Parliament back in former Liberal prime minister John Chrétien's days to promote investment in green technology, a laudable objective. It continued its work under former prime minister Stephen Harper and would likely be thriving today if the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had left it alone, but he could not resist the temptation of firing the people who were there and putting his own friends in place instead. That is what went wrong. The Prime Minister's friends sat on the board and, despite conflicts of interest, distributed money among themselves, insiders helping other insiders, Liberal friends helping each other. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608915">We know all of this from the independent Auditor General's report 6, which was tabled in Parliament on June 4, a couple of weeks before the House rose for the summer break. It is highly critical of what was happening at SDTC. I am not going to get into the details because the report is public information, but I will discuss some examples. There was $390 million in misallocated taxpayer funds that was granted to insiders or non-qualifying projects. These are insiders on the board of directors supporting each other in their grant applications. There were 186 examples of conflicts of interest, with board members voting for each other's applications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608916">The Auditor General learned about this from a whistle-blower. This is what one of those whistle-blowers told the standing parliamentary committee now looking into it: “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.” There we have it. It is not just mismanagement but criminality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608917">Therefore, we, the official opposition Conservative Party, did what we were elected to do, which is holding the government to account and uncovering corruption. Where there is smoke, there is fire. We are doing our job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608918">We put forward a motion shortly after the Auditor General's report was tabled. I am going to read a small portion of it: “That the House order the government, Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) and the Auditor General of Canada each to deposit with the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, within 30 days of the adoption of this order, the following documents, created or dated since January 1, 2017”. The order goes on to describe what some of those documents are, the different types and categories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608919">This Conservative motion passed a little while later, on June 10, with the support of the other opposition parties, the NDP and the Bloc Québécois. Only Liberal members of Parliament voted against it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8608920">I know the Liberals are not happy with the order, but this is the reality of a minority House. This is the way it works. They do not have a majority. They need to play nice with, and get support from, one of the opposition parties. They failed to do that. They are now stuck with this order they say they do not like. Well, that is too bad. Parliament is supreme, Parliament made the order and the Liberal Party must now comply with it. The governing party does not have a choice not to comply with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608921">That is what happened. Nothing happened during the summer. Some of the documents were delivered, but not all. Clearly, the order was not complied with. We got back here in September after the summer break and things started to get very ugly. The first day back in the House, our House leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, rose on a question of privilege “concerning the failure of the government to comply with the order that the House adopted on Monday, June 10”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608922">I do not have to repeat anything in the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader</Affiliation>'s speech. It is in Hansard for anybody who is interested in reading it. It is well researched, it is well written, and it is convincing. As a matter of fact, it convinced the Speaker, and a couple of days later, the Speaker made his ruling. The ruling confirms the earlier order. The <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and all relevant government departments must comply with the original document production order as demanded, unredacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608923">The <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">Liberal House leader</Affiliation> has been leading a valiant but ultimately failing charge against this document production order and the Speaker's ruling. She raises several interesting but specious constitutional arguments, which I would summarize as follows: number one, the document production order trespasses on the charter right of freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, section 8 of the charter; number two, the document production order exceeds the authority of the House by attempting to secure documents for a third party, namely the RCMP; and number three, the document production order is an unconstitutional attempt by the House of Commons to appropriate the role of another branch of government, namely the judiciary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608924">All are interesting and creative arguments but, in my submission, ineffective, and a little late in the day, as far as the Speaker was concerned. In his ruling, he said, “The Chair would suggest, respectfully, that these concerns ought to have been raised prior to the motion's adoption.” The first thing we learn in law school is that if a person is going to present in court, they better get all the evidence in, all the facts and all their arguments before the judge makes his ruling, not afterwards. It is too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608925">The Speaker came to the reasonable conclusion that the document production order of a couple of months earlier stood, that it was not followed, and that the Liberals are wrong. The <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office must comply with the document production order.</ParaText>

I know the Liberals are not happy with this, with the original motion or with the ruling. They say it is unusual, that this is not normal course of business. Well, maybe so, but it is the ruling of the House and the House is supreme, and it can make this order, as the Speaker has ruled.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8608930"> It is important to highlight that the other two opposition parties, the NDP and the Bloc Québécois, have both noted that while the order might be unusual, that does not excuse non-compliance, and I would underline that. There is no excuse for non-compliance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608931">Experts agree with that position. I am going to quote from Bosc and Gagnon, who are experts in this field. <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, 2017, at page 985, talks about Parliament's right to order the production of documents. It reads, “No statute or practice diminishes the fullness of that power rooted in House privileges unless there is an explicit legal provision to that effect, or unless the House adopts a specific resolution limiting the power.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608932">The House has never set a limit on its power to order the production of papers and records; therefore, the production order stands. Ancient history says that Parliament can do this, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refuses to comply. That is why we are at an impasse. That is why things have ground to a halt, and until this is resolved, nothing will be debated but this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608933">The Liberals blame it on us, and I am saying they need to comply with the orders. Canadians want to know what is in those documents. What are they hiding? I think that is the fundamental question. What are they worried about? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608934">The Speaker was trying to be helpful and suggested that all the parties could send this off to the committee and have members look at it there, but he noted, correctly in my submission, that “it is ultimately for the House to decide how it wishes to proceed”. The House has decided and the House has ordered the production of the documents. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party must comply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608935">The way I see it, the Liberals have three choices. They can comply with the order, which is what we have been saying all along for the last nine days. Number two, they can sue the Speaker, who I know will not take that personally. They have done that before. They can challenge the Speaker's ruling based on all the specious arguments they have put forward already. Number three, they can ask the Governor General to dissolve the 44th Parliament and call an election. This is what we have been calling for all along. It is my preference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608936">Number one is obviously the simplest and the cleanest, which is to comply with the order and we get on with business. We can then send it to committee. Number two is the most interesting. It would be to sue the Speaker. The Liberals have done this in the past, and then they changed their mind, dissolved Parliament and called an election. As a student of constitutional law and Canadian history, I think that would be the most interesting. Let us go ahead and do it and see if the Supreme Court will even take the case on.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8608969">Mr. Speaker, before I became a parliamentarian, first as the member for Red Deer, and now as the representative of the great riding of Red Deer—Mountain View, I spent 34 years as a high school math and physics teacher. As such, I always felt that, when dealing with problems, it is critical to be concise and to work with undeniable facts. This is a task that we have at hand in the House, a task that the House has seized over a grievous disservice to the Canadian public. We must continue to go forward until this grievous matter has been rightfully resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608970">However, of course, whether or not this can be resolved remains to be seen as the Liberal government thinks it can gaslight Canadians into believing that somehow enabling corruption protects Canadians. Let me be on the record today saying that this government's reaction to the production order of the Speaker shows that they are only interested in protecting those who have been the benefactors of nine years of corruption, irresponsible deficits and dishonesty to the Canadian taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608971"> The people of Red Deer—Mountain View and I have seen enough. Here is what we are up against: What do we get when we have significant lapses in governance and stewardship of public funds, plus poor management over conflicts of interest and non-compliance with the law? We get corruption, plain and simple. This is the root cause of the case we, as His Majesty's official opposition and as servants to Canadians, are prosecuting today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608972">The Auditor General found all those ingredients for corruption in a blistering report released this past summer. I have spent many years sitting on the public accounts committee, and since the time of Sheila Fraser, I have had the greatest respect for the officials who work at the Auditor General's office. What they have uncovered is mind-boggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608973">As a teacher, whenever my students were tasked with solving a difficult physics problem, they had to show their work, and when the first steps became clear, they could more easily progress through to the next stage of the solution. Students had to show how they came up with an answer to the problems they were attempting to solve, and this gets more challenging the more difficult and complex the problem becomes, but in that way, basic truths allow them to analyze and solve more complicated questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608974">I will acknowledge that managing the federal government of Canada is not an easy task. Overseeing how we will feed Canadians and our allies around the world, how we will safeguard the value of Canadian sovereignty and citizenship, and how we will have secure, reliable and affordable energy for all Canadians is indeed a complex venture, but these federal departments that we rely on must build upon trust and truth. It is all the more an indictment on this government that they are unwilling to show their work and fulfill an order from the House to produce the documents, as the Speaker has decreed. This government clearly did not comply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608975">If we are supposed to tell our children, our youth, the bright young minds of the future, that they need to show their work when solving their math homework, why on earth is our federal government not able to do the same? I have a suggestion as to why. Maybe it has to do with the reality that they are so caught up in their its attempts to cling to power that it will ignore House orders to procure documents on the failed glorified slush fund and will overlook what Canadians coast to coast already see when they tune in to their federal legislature, which is that this government has lost control of the House and must accept the reality that Canada is ready for a change, a change for the better, a change that will do away with scandal after scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608976"> In the Auditor General's report I mentioned earlier, it is made clear that Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, did not establish clear assessment guidance to determine eligibility of projects, so let us allow that to sink in. According to SDTC's website, as of March 31, 2023, they had given out $1.71 billion in funding. The words “assessments guidance to determine eligibility of projects” is fancy talk for how decisions are made to give money to projects and businesses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8608977"> It is absolutely ridiculous that a federally funded foundation, under the current government's watch, was able to hand out taxpayer dollars without a clear idea of who ought to be deserving of those funds to achieve the objectives its organizations were established to fulfill. It is no different from a football team paying a coach to run plays and make decisions without the notion of a playbook. The idea that taxpayer dollars were allowed to be played with in this manner is unacceptable and frankly disturbing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608978"> To better illuminate the gravity of the situation, I will once again draw on my teaching experience. Let us all put ourselves in the shoes of a grade 11 high school student who is beginning to complete what teachers sometimes call an independent research project. For an independent research project, usually students are tasked with coming up with a topic to study, but the important role of the teacher is to give students a framework with which they will be able to structure their assignment and therefore use their findings effectively. Without an assignment structure or grading criteria, students are left with little to go on. Do we want federally funded foundations to be in the habit of having little to go on?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608979"> What I am trying to highlight by drawing out these parallels with what we take for granted as common sense in a classroom, is that these classroom experiences often seem to be very similar to what happens in the real world. Perhaps this is by design. That is why I am trying to paint a picture for Canadians, those whom have had the pleasure of teaching and all of us here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608980">The Auditor General also found that SDTC poorly managed conflicts of interest. This, my colleagues, is really where I struggle to find any sort of solace from the Liberal government's response to this scandal. SDTC records show that conflict of interest policies were not followed in 90 cases and that SDTC did not report conflicts of interest. I would say this is shocking, but it is on par with what we and Canadians have now come to expect from our current government, and this is a shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608981"> There is an obvious reality that, for Canada to be the greatest country on earth, we need a new government that respects the rights of Canadians, has integrity and possesses a strong commitment to principles. It would seem that this no longer is the case after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government. Back in the day, to their credit, Liberals stayed true to their word and would aim to avoid such scandals, although the Gomery inquiry shook their confidence so many years ago. However, today, those actions are commonplace and feel as though they are just a matter of daily business. True Liberals are now fleeing a party that has now become a shadow of its former self.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608982"> I am a firm believer that humility is a virtue, and a particularly valuable one for an elected representative of the people. Is it not common sense for us? Is it not common sense for decision-makers of a fund to recuse themselves from an investment decision regarding a firm they have clear ties to? I am sure it must be challenging to conduct this practice when the fund in question is both funded by the Liberal government and when that are also in talks with firms that have strong insider connections to their network. Therefore, I ask again, would it not be common sense to do what is best for the fund's performance and, in this case, the value for money received from Canadian taxpayer dollars? If it is as I suspect, then why has there been a failure to implement such an obvious standard for a federally funded foundation that had used at least $1 billion in taxpayer funds? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608983">I would like to let those who are listening now know that it was common-sense Conservatives who fought against the corrupt government after nine years, and common-sense Conservatives would work diligently to undo the mess that this has caused our nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608984"> I have already pointed out that the Auditor General had serious concerns with this glorified green slush fund. I would also like to bring it all together to a final point, and this goes back to what fundamentally shapes government. It is people. The former chair of SDTC had to resign as she was found to have improperly furthered the interests of companies associated with her own ventures according to the Ethics Commissioner. This is not right.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8608985"> The Ethics Commissioner also found that this individual participated in funding decisions that benefited her own financial interests. The SDTC staff even tried to raise concerns with the staff of ISED and its minister at the time, but their concerns were ultimately dismissed. No one knows why these concerns were dismissed, but I can tell members one thing: Innocent, hard-working Canadians have been caught in the crosshairs of this mess. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608986">On this side of the House, and I believe I speak for my colleagues, we believe in fair and just prosecution. I believe the inability of the Liberal government and a select elite few, who are calling the shots in agencies and foundations that are supposed to be at arm's length, does not reflect everyone involved. However, that is truly the saddest part of it all. Everywhere the government has gone and touched with its paws, it has sown disorder and distrust and broken the fabric that holds this country together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608987">The Liberal government has lost control of its spending. In 2015, it promised that it would only be in a deficit temporarily. This is a claim that, as outgoing prime minister, Stephen Harper called out from the beginning, and it is a claim that has cost many young Canadians affordable gas, affordable food and a warm place to call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8608988"> Of course, it is on the Liberals that they have lost the humility to produce documents that would hold them to account, even when the Speaker of the House rules that this contradicts what would be in the best interests of Canadians. I will say once again what I said at the beginning of my remarks: Enough is enough. The Liberal government has a history of legislative manoeuvring that it uses to avoid accountability. Many believed the rhetoric of the need for a COVID election back in 2021, but the reality is that it was caught up in a scandal then as well. That scandal involved it not wanting to provide documents for the Winnipeg lab fiasco. Of course, by calling an election, it could and did put that controversy behind it, at least for a while. A $600-million cabinet shuffle during a pandemic election was all it took to take the heat off the fact that the Speaker had moved to the next steps of controversy and taken the government to court. Whether the current Speaker takes similar steps remains to be seen, but the pattern is clear. Maybe proroguing Parliament will shift the focus, but when Parliament resumes after such a move, this matter still needs to be resolved. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8609000">I have a great deal of respect for Canadian innovators. The technology that has been supported since Sustainable Development Technology Canada was established in 2001 has been a constructive part of Canada's research and development mix. This government's obsession with green technology and the narrow scope that it has showed lately to such technology is defined, along with the now obvious lack of discipline by the board, which gives true meaning to the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609001"> What the AG found, and what committee members have dug up, is that 82% of funding transactions approved by the board over a five-year sampling period were said to be conflicted. Through the AG's analysis of 226 contracts, 186 were conflicted, and so it is entirely possible that the total 405 transactions approved by the board and the corresponding 333 contracts could also be suspect. If the ratios were correct, there would be a further 147 suspicious contracts. A federal investigation would need to get started really soon to get to the bottom of this, since this entire affair reeks of corruption. </ParaText>

However, the Auditor General has expressed a concern on the blurring of the powers between different parts of the government, and the RCMP has specifically said in a letter to the law clerk of the House of Commons that it is very unlikely that it can use the records that this motion would provide to it in its investigation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8609027"> Mr. Speaker, “with great power comes great responsibility.” Many will recognize this expression from the wise words of advice Uncle Ben gave to a young Peter Parker in relation to his alter ego, Spider-Man. While this proverb has certainly been popularized again in the modern era by Spider-Man comics, its meaning is found throughout human history, such as the tale of the sword hanging by a single hair over the head of Damocles while King Dionysius permitted him to experience being king for a day. It is not only a powerful mantra for everyday living, but it is fitting for the situation we find ourselves in within the House of Commons today with the motion we have been debating for the past several days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609028">It is an immense privilege and responsibility to sit in this place, to be sent here by our neighbours to our nation's capital, to be their voice in the halls of power. The Westminster system is unlike any other form of government. This is the House of Commons, where the common citizen is chosen by other common citizens to be sent here to represent them. We have the government of the day, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Privy Council ministers, deputy ministers, assistant deputy ministers, and thousands of bureaucrats. Canadians may well believe that those people have power, but in the Westminster system, quite the opposite is true. Everyday citizens of Canada hold the power through the people they send to the House of the common people. Canadians are the boss and we, in this place, are their servants, sitting in their chair for a very brief moment in the long arc of history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609029">This is parliamentary supremacy, a term that is not often used outside of academia, but what does it mean? Why does parliamentary supremacy matter to the marine mechanic in Pointe au Baril, the cranberry farmer in Bala or the server in South River? It matters to them because it means that they hold the power and that, collectively, the members in this place who represent them are far more powerful than any cabinet minister or even a prime minister. We are the people's voice and the people's voice is supreme. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609030">A majority of citizen representatives in the House of the people has demanded the production of documents related to a $390-million spending scandal of the government's making. Despite that parliamentary supremacy, the government, the cabinet and the Prime Minister have simply refused. This is not even the first time the Liberal government has ignored an order from the people's representatives to produce documents. Canadians may well remember the Winnipeg lab document scandal. Parliament ordered documents to be released that pertained to Canada's top infectious disease laboratory where two scientists were intentionally working to benefit the Chinese Communist Regime. The government fought to keep those documents hidden from the people, ignoring orders and even taking the former Speaker of the House to court to hide the truth, not just from us in the House of Commons, but from all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609031">There can be no dispute that oftentimes in this place we exchange partisan jabs in question period. It can be a very ruckus affair with heckling and plenty of theatrics. In certain circumstances, there comes a matter so fundamental to the functioning of the House, a matter so fundamental to the rights of Canadians, those citizens who sent us here to speak for them, that we must hit the pause button on the regular business of this place to protect the very purpose of this place and the rights of the Canadians who sent us here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609032">How did we get here? In 2001, the government of Stephen Harper created an organization that would, “Demonstrate new technologies to promote sustainable development, including technologies to address issues related to climate change and the quality of air, water and soil.” This organization was to funder public-private partnerships to commercialize new green technologies. It was called Sustainable Development Technology Canada. Since its creation, it invested in over 300 projects all across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609033">It was a great idea that worked very well until the current Liberal government was elected. In 2017, just before the current government took office, the Auditor General reviewed Sustainable Development Technology Canada and delivered a very positive report indicating that the organization was operating appropriately. Then, late in 2018, then industry minister Navdeep Bains started to complain about the then chair Jim Balsillie. He was a chair who was leading the organization well, according to the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8609034"> Minister Bains complained that Mr. Balsillie had been critical of some government legislation. Imagine that. Then in 2019, Minister Bains began appointing Liberal friends and insiders to the board of directors of Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609035">It is important to note that Sustainable Development Technology Canada was not an agency completely independent from the government. The Minister of Industry appointed the board, and several staff members from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada would regularly sit in on meetings and monitor the activities of the board. Minister Bains then appointed Annette Verschuren, someone who was receiving Sustainable Development Technology Canada funding through one of her companies, to be the new chair of the board. Immediately, red flags should have gone up. This new chair, the steward of this fund, the person who was tapped to oversee its operations and hand out money, was a recipient of the same money she was supposed to be watching over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609036">It turns out red flags did go up. Minister Bains, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Privy Council Office were all warned. They were all told of the risks associated with appointing this conflicted chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609037">In an alternate universe where Canadians had a competent government that was accountable and responsible and followed the rules, an appointment like this would never have been made in the first place. Of course, that is not what happened, because Canadians do not have a competent, responsible government. We have a scandal-plagued, incompetent Liberal government that has proven time and time again that with every issue they tackle, they make it worse, and that the interests of their well-connected friends and supporters, or the interests of those close to them, always come before the interests of Canadians. We saw it with the WE Charity scandal. Friends of the Liberal Party were quietly and quickly awarded a government contract worth $40 million, until the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation> found out and started digging. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609038">In June 2019, Minister Bains, after having received some sound advice that appointing an individual to lead a public fund whose companies benefit from that fund was a bad idea, ignored the advice and appointed her anyhow. Did this new chair implement a radical change in culture? Did she lead with integrity and honour to ensure that conflicts of interest between public funds and private interests did not occur? Absolutely not. In fact, the new Liberal board chair went on to create a corporate environment where conflicts of interest were not just merely tolerated but facilitated. Other members of the board went on to award public money, Canadians' money, to companies in which board members held stock or leadership positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609039">I think it is important for everyone to understand what “conflict of interest” means. The Oxford dictionary describes it this way: a situation in which a person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609040">In this case, Liberal board members' individual interests were enriched by their actions in their professional and public duties. That is a problem, and Canadians understand that. We can forgive the average Canadian, who is not likely as familiar with the fancy boardrooms that Liberal insiders frequent, but it is not really that complicated to excuse ourselves or remove ourselves from situations where we are or are perceived to be in a conflict of interest. It is a perfectly legitimate action to take. In fact, it is the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609041">There are simple and straightforward procedures to avoid a conflict of interest. It is the honourable thing to do. It is an act of integrity, of being faithful to our public role and our solemn responsibility to the citizens of this country, whose money we are spending and whose trust we must strive to earn every single day. However, the Liberal insiders on the Sustainable Development Technology Canada board did not care about that public trust. They did not care about honour or integrity. Even more galling is that these dishonourable Liberals did it all out in the open. They were so arrogant and pleased with their self-enrichment at the expense of the Canadian taxpayer that they did not even try to hide their corruption.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8609054">Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General of Canada launched a thorough investigation that revealed widespread conflicts of interest, corruption and abuse of Canadians' hard-earned dollars at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. On June 10 of this year, the House members, by a majority vote of 174 to 148, developed a motion calling for the production of documents from Sustainable Development Technology Canada to be turned over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609055">How did the government respond to an order from the people's voice? Departments either outright refused to comply or heavily redacted and blacked out relevant documents that the people demanded. There was nothing in the people's order to allow for any redactions. The people have demanded the truth, and they want the RCMP to be able to investigate the misuse and abuse of their dollars. This has been the talk of the Ottawa bubble these days: The Constitution Act, the Parliament of Canada Act, parliamentary privilege and the privilege of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609056">Imagine that, while sitting in these hallowed chambers surrounding by deferential security guards, we could be debating our privileges as members. There are Canadians out there who are hungry and worried about how they are going to heat their homes as the winter sets in, but our privileges have been breached. It is not our privilege, but the right of Canadians to know what their own government is up to. Our Fathers of Confederation gave that power of the people to their representatives who sit in this place. It is not because I am a member of Parliament that I believe I have the privilege to access these documents. It is because the people who we all represent have that right. They have tasked us in the House and, as a House, we have a powerful ability to exercise that right, an absolute and unfettered ability to exercise that right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609057">Why did the House feel compelled to order these documents? It has everything to do with the Auditor General's findings. She found that 82% of transactions involving payment from Sustainable Development Technology Canada to companies approved by the board of directors were conflicted. According to the Auditor General, $300 million of Canadians' money was given to companies where the board members who voted to award those companies had a conflict of interest. Three hundred million dollars of public money was being used to fund private interests of the people who were voting to award the funds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609058">It is reasonable to think that this scandal goes deeper. In the five-year period of examination by the Auditor General there were 405 transactions approved by the board. The Auditor General looked at 226, so just over half of the transactions, and found that 186 of the transactions were conflicted. We can assume that the ratio stands for the entire package of 405 transactions. The Auditor General also found that the same Liberal-appointed board approved and funded another 58 million dollars' worth of projects that were outside the mandate of the foundation. They were not even eligible under their own rules, but the Liberal board gave them the money anyhow. The Liberals would have us believe that this is an example of a bureaucracy off track, but the Auditor General made it clear that the blame of the scandal falls on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who “did not sufficiently monitor” the contracts that were given to well-connected Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609059">What we have here is not just gross mismanagement, it is corruption and blatant conflict of interest by Liberal appointees to the tune of $300 million. There was abuse of the public purse: A personal enrichment under the guise of helping the environment. Once these companies that were connected to Liberal insiders received these government grants, they were seen as having a seal of approval by outside financiers. This allowed these companies to go and collect millions more dollars to further their interests. It was a green slush fund for well-connected Liberals. Canadians' money was mishandled and private interest got in the way, once again, of the public good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609060">It would be reasonable to conclude that we are debating yet another Liberal spending scandal. Reasonable because there have been so many Liberal spending scandals that it is tough to keep up. It would be understandable if some were to believe that we are engaged in some sort of self-serving debate about members of Parliament's privilege. In truth, this debate, this motion of privilege that has halted all the other work of the House, is about the very foundations of our democracy and the right of citizens of this country to know what their government is doing. That sword of Damocles hangs over the head of the government. It hangs precariously over the Liberal government and its ministers who, on so many occasions, arrogantly operate as though they are above the law, as though they are above the people. Conservatives will never relent in exposing the corruption of the government, and we will never relent in our solemn duty to be the voice of the people in the House, their House, where we defend their rights above the rights of Liberal insiders, Liberal cabinet ministers and, most certainly, above the rights of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278390" Type="2">Mr. Michael Barrett (Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8609089">Mr. Speaker, we have breaking news, and it comes from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It deals, of course with the latest, $400-million, scandal facing the Liberal government. The RCMP confirms that it is investigating the $400-million scandal of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that has paralyzed Parliament. It also confirms that is has and is using the documents that have so far been turned over by the parliamentary law clerk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609090">This raises questions about why the government was willing to turn over some of the documents, yet some departments refused outright. Some departments have said they are not even a part of the government, which is an absolutely incredible statement to hear. I want to reference another bit of information about redacted records or the absence of them. The list of departments that did not comply is typed in a very small typeface on an 11-inch by 17-inch sheet of paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609091">One in particular stands out: the Department of Justice. There are more than 10,000 pages they are not turning over. Why will the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s DOJ not turn over the documents to the cops? What is so damning in them that, while the RCMP confirms they have some of the documents, the Liberals and their co-conspirators are not prepared to turn over the rest? Canadians have a right to know what is in the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609092">As a matter of fact, the Liberal government has a legal obligation to turn the documents over. It is not because I said so; it is because Canada is a democracy. A majority of democratically elected MPs used the powers that have been bestowed on the House of Commons to ensure that when a matter is of public interest, the production of papers is absolute and unrestricted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609093">What could be more important to the institution of Parliament and to the protection of our democracy than to make sure, in this matter involving more than 180 conflicts of interest and $400 million in a corruption scandal overseen by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and all the Liberals who have stood up today, especially the <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>, who has clocked over 100 minutes in this saga that has paralyzed Parliament, that the government turns over the documents. Why will it not turn over the documents, which are so important, so Canadians can get answers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609094">Are we looking to be the judge, jury and executioner in this place? No, we are not. We want to turn the matter over to the RCMP. Is the RCMP going to investigate because we told it to? No, the RCMP is investigating because it has reasonable grounds to believe an offence under the Criminal Code has been committed and that it is in the public interest for it to investigate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609095"> The RCMP will lay a charge if it believes there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. Is that why the Liberals are withholding all the documents from all the many departments? There is the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; it is too afraid to turn over documents. Others include the Canada Revenue Agency, the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, foreign affairs, the department of housing, the Department of National Defence and Natural Resources Canada, and on and on it goes. There are 10 thousand pages from the Department of Justice alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609096"> We have heard this before from the Liberals with respect to the RCMP. The <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> has said that it can get a production order, knock on the door and tell the Liberals to turn over the documents. The Liberal government and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the one who has been found guilty of breaking the law twice himself, along with his <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="300000" Type="4">small business minister</Affiliation>, broke the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609097">With that as the context, when the RCMP knocked on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s door, in a case of a criminal matter, the Liberals said they could not turn over the documents because of cabinet confidence. This is what is going to happen; this is the game they want to play.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8609098">They want this to go to committee, they say, but why? Is it because the documents would be tabled with the committee? No, it would be to study the question of whether the documents should be tabled. The House already ordered the production of the documents, so that is done by a majority of democratically elected members, not the one party with a minority of seats in this House, shrinking returns in every election and evaporating public support. That is not who gets to decide; the majority of democratically elected members does. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609099">That decision has been made. They must turn over the documents, because it is the law, but that does not concern these Liberals or that Attorney General, because they want this to go to committee, and they want the police to come and say, “Can you turn over those documents? You said if we brought a search warrant that you would provide them.” They will say, “We are afraid it is cabinet confidence. Here are those 10,000 pages heavily redacted.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609100"> That is the game that they are playing with our democracy. It makes me wonder, if they are prepared to violate this law, what other laws these Liberals will break. We have seen some broken, as I said before, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, by the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> and by the <Affiliation DbId="300000" Type="4">small business minister</Affiliation>. These Liberals, when they got tired of being found guilty for breaking Canada's Conflict of Interest Act, the laws that are supposed to protect from exactly the kind of thing that led to $400 million in corruption in this latest expense scandal, appointed the public safety minister, who had been found guilty of breaking the Conflict of Interest Act in clam scam, awarding lucrative contracts to his family members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609101">Again, Liberal insiders are always their priority. They appointed his sister-in-law to be the Ethics Commissioner. How convenient would that be? At Thanksgiving dinner this weekend, they would say, “Nice to see you. Could you pass the stuffing? Also, could you look the other way on this latest conflict of interest affecting the Liberals?” That is what they are cooking up this Thanksgiving weekend, but the production of these documents was ordered by the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609102">They, of course, want it to go to committee to bury it. The amendment and sub-amendment put forward are extremely reasonable. The list of witnesses that we would want to testify to provide fulsome answers to committee is incredibly important, but we would be faced with another problem when we get there, and we will get to a point where the House can vote for this to go to committee, once we have had the opportunity to have this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609103">However, then we are going to deal with another issue affecting the government, further paralyzing Parliament. That deals with the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">employment minister</Affiliation>, this Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s minister from Edmonton, who, along with his pandemic profiteering business partner, have this unbelievable scandal that has seen a ruling from the Speaker about the rights of democratically elected members to get fulsome, honest answers and information from individuals who are sent for by this place. Again, it is a right of this House to send for people and to send for papers. In that case, the individual, the business partner of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton Centre, refused to provide information on who the “other Randy” is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609104">We need to know that information, because it strikes at the heart of a matter that is incredibly important to Canadians. We learned that the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton Centre's business while he is serving in cabinet, of which he owned a 50% share, was awarded a contract by his own government. That is not okay, but what makes it worse is that the minister said he had not been in contact with his business partner for all of 2022 in particular. That year is important, because his business partner said the minister had not been in touch with him either for that year. We will take the minister at his word, and it is case closed. Unfortunately, we can trust them as far as we can throw them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8609105">We demanded the production of papers, which is, again, one of those rights that we have, and what did we learn? They were texting and they were talking. Why is that a problem? It is a problem because what he said was not the truth. What the witness, his business partner Mr. Anderson, said was not the truth. What they told the newspaper was not the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609106">It also means a sitting member of the Liberal cabinet was directing the day-to-day business affairs of a company that was netting Government of Canada contracts worth tens of thousands of dollars, to say nothing of the fact that the service it provided was, as I said, pandemic profiteering. It was like the guys during the pandemic who would go to Costco, buy up all the toilet paper and then sell it out of their van at the end of the parking lot for an inflated price. Instead of just people in the community being the victims, it victimized people across Canada, getting contracts from all kinds of governments, with the name of a sitting cabinet minister as the co-owner of the business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609107">That is what they have been doing. That is the matter this House is seized with and paralyzed by. It all has to do with conflicts of interest and refusing to follow the law, orders of Parliament. If Canadians have to follow the law, why do the Liberals not have to? I get asked often by Canadians. They want to know why the RCMP will not finally investigate. Here we have a letter from the commissioner of the RCMP dated October 9. It reads, in part, “I wish to inform you that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into SDTC is ongoing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609108">SDTC, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, operated under governments of different stripes up until 2017 with a clean bill of health from Canada's Auditor General. Stephen Harper absolutely oversaw this fund. We hear the Liberals say Conservatives do not want to take any action on environment. Here we are with this clean-tech business, with a billion dollars of Canadian tax money, looking to help start-ups and innovators in the clean-tech space. We think it is incredibly important that we solve issues facing our environment and our climate, with technology and not with a tax on everything. We know, in my province of Ontario, that is going to cost families $1,400 more than they get back in the fake, phony rebates that the Liberals talk up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609109">We had this fund, SDTC, which was given a clean bill of health by the Auditor General up to 2017, but it was after that when the trouble set in. The current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed his choice, a Liberal, as chair of the fund. Can members guess what happened? The Liberal Prime Minister was found guilty of breaking ethics laws twice, so what do we think happened when he put his hand-picked selection in as chair? Well, along came the conflicts of interest, 186 of them, and $400 million that we know about. This is really important because the Auditor General did not look into 100% of the deals done and votes cast at the $1-billion slush fund, but of the cases they looked into, the Auditor General and her army of auditors found conflicts in 80% of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609110"> There is no other organization in the world that, when it finds out one of its subsidiaries is rife with corruption and alleged criminality, would say, “We are not going to turn over the documents to the RCMP; we are not going to call the cops. We are going to call a committee.” There is no other organization that would do that unless it has something to hide. What do the Liberals have to hide? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609111">I think we know. It is all the things they do not want the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to see. They are worried that the King's cowboys are going to ride in and find all kinds of dirty deals with Liberal insiders getting rich while Canadians were lined up at food banks in record numbers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8609112"> StatsCan this week said that income inequality in this country had reached a point never seen in the history of our country since it started measuring it. It is StatsCan that said one in four Canadians do not know where their next meals are going to come from. That is really important because the unemployment rate in this country is not 25%, or one in four, so that means there are millions of Canadians going to work and, between the shift at their first job and the start of their shift at their second job, they need to make a stop at the food bank so they can afford to feed themselves and their children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609113">That is life after nine years of the NDP-Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is not that the Liberals have been spending money to help Canadians get ahead. They have been spending money to make sure Liberal insiders live large. We saw it with their $60-million arrive scam. We see it in this case with the $400 million at their green slush fund, Sustainable Development Technologies Canada. Of course, when confronted with the problem, Liberals denied it, and then they folded the organization only to pull it underneath the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who was not turning over documents to the police. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609114">We saw it when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried to reward his buddies at the WE Charity organization, Marc and Craig Kielburger. We saw it when he tried to help his friends at SNC-Lavalin with a get-out-of-jail-free card. When he was called out by the then <Affiliation DbId="214323" Type="21">attorney general</Affiliation>, how did he treat Ms. Wilson-Raybould, an experienced Crown prosecutor? He fired her. He threw her under the bus. When the then <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>, an experienced physician, stood up and said what was happening was wrong, what did he do to the second woman in his caucus who spoke out against him? He threw her under the bus too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609115">It is because it is all about Liberal insiders, like when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gets a phone call from someone who is getting millions of dollars from his government and is looking for a big grant, looking for a couple million bucks, and says that they should talk about it at their island in the Bahamas, and that he should bring the president of the Liberal Party with him so they can all have a nice conversation about it together. It is a free trip for the Prime Minister, but who is picking up the tab? It is always Canadians who are stuck with the bill when it comes to the Prime Minister, who is helping Liberal insiders and his well-connected friends get ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609116">The ask is very simple: Do not break the law. It looks like the Liberals have struggled with that one. Parliament has the legal authority to order the production of these documents, which is a matter of fact.

              <ParaText id="8609119">I have really good news at the end of what seems like a pretty depressing 20 minutes and a depressing nine years.

              <ParaText id="8609122">I take issue with how the member, probably more than any other Conservative member, tries to politicize things. How many times have we heard him say “Liberal-appointed chair” and that she is a Liberal and Liberal-friendly?

              <ParaText id="8609135"> In the example I gave earlier about SNC-Lavalin, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cooked up a phony story about trying to save jobs. He was really just trying to save his buddies, who were giving him big donations. In fact, he obstructed a criminal investigation and obstructed an investigation into his obstruction of justice. That shows us what an abuse of power is, and it has been perpetrated on Canadians by the Liberal Prime Minister and his Liberal members for far too long. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8609136"> Mr. Speaker, it is not only me, the member for Winnipeg North, who is saying “abuse of power”. The former law clerk of Parliament did so. He is from an independent institution and is not partisan, and he said, “it is an abuse of its powers for the House to use its powers to demand and get documents from the Government in order to transfer them to a third party (RCMP) that wouldn't otherwise receive them or to compel the government to give documents to the third party.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8609138"> Mr. Speaker, I have great news, which is that the current parliamentary law clerk has affirmed for Canadians that Parliament continues to have the unfettered right to send for persons and papers. This is in spite of a Liberal government and a Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wanting to trample on the rights of democratically elected members to represent them, to stop the corruption being perpetrated on them. Of course, Mr. Speaker, you know that, because your ruling that the order for the production of documents was valid was informed by the expertise of the current parliamentary law clerk. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8609144">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise and speak in this chamber, but not happy about the occasion. We are talking about yet another example of the culture of secrecy that has penetrated the government. It was baked in right from the start and that is the shame of it. Many Canadians are old enough to remember the 2015 election campaign. The government promised to be the most open and transparent government in Canadian history, and the shame of this is how it has flagrantly broken that promise every day of this Parliament. This is a government that is reflexively secretive in all things and scandal-prone from the start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609145">Going back to the Liberals' promise of openness and transparency to set part of the stage here, this is a government that passed an access to information law after it was first elected, which the Information Commissioner said was a step backward in access to information. The Liberals promised. They succeeded in that 2015 election. They figured out how to eat the NDP's lunch and how to go after traditional NDP supporters. Many members of the NDP, to their credit, have long spoken about openness and transparency, and they had criticized access to information over the decades in Canada. That was one of the promises where the Liberals zeroed in on a group of voters, promised them what they wanted to hear and then broke the promise. This attitude of reflexive and instinctive secrecy governs every bit of conduct of the government. We have seen it time and time again. The government is a scandal-plagued government that has no regard for our laws around ethics and around access to information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609146">Early on in the government, let us not forget that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke the law and accepted an illegal vacation. That was one of the first things he did. He became the first Prime Minister to be found to contravene the Conflict of Interest Act. This is the type of scandal we see from the government over and over again. There was the India trip wherein the government sent an invitation to a man convicted of terrorism, convicted of the attempted murder of an India cabinet minister and who assaulted a former premier of British Columbia and member of this Parliament. That is the company the government keeps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609147">We saw early in the 42nd Parliament, the SNC-Lavalin scandal wherein the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> brought in a new law by sneaking it into a budget implementation bill. I was at the finance committee. Mr. Speaker, you where there too, I recall. The government snuck a deferred prosecution law into a budget implementation act. At the finance committee, we scratched our heads and wondered what that was doing in a budget implementation act. Even you, Mr. Speaker, and other Liberals around the table were wondering about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609148">It was implemented into law and it became pretty clear pretty quickly why that deferred prosecution law was brought in. It was brought in to get a corrupt company off the hook in furtherance of the interests, in his own words, of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation>, who said this was why it was essential that this corrupt company be granted a deferred prosecution, something hand-delivered to that company for that purpose by the government in a budget implementation act. What we saw from that was a fallout that resulted in cabinet resignation, caucus expulsions and the retirement of the chief clerk of the Privy Council.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8609149">It is to the credit of Jody Wilson-Raybould, who stood up to the government and said that this kind of greasy corruption would not be allowed to stand, that she would not allow the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office to interfere in a criminal prosecution. She was fired as minister of justice, shuffled, then dumped and expelled from the Liberal caucus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609150">We have a government where the then-fisheries minister tried to give a lucrative clam fishing licence, to a relative. I thank my friend behind me, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, for bringing that to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609151"> This was all in the 42nd Parliament. This was right from the beginning. We came back into the 43rd Parliament, with much reduced numbers on the other side, in no small part to this kind of dishonest conduct, and what did they do? They picked up right where they left off and handed half a billion dollars over to a friendly but ultimately discredited charity, the WE scandal, where the conflicts of interest of the then-finance minister Bill Morneau and his ties to that organization ultimately led to his resignation. We saw the Winnipeg lab scandal emerge in the 43rd Parliament, where Parliament found the government in contempt over its refusal to table documents for which the production was ordered by the House, by elected members of Parliament who have the right, under the Constitution of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609152">We have the charter, which guarantees the democratic rights of Canadians, and the Constitution of Canada, which declares that this is the supreme inquisitor for Canadians, that members of Parliament have the right to documents and to compel witnesses in furtherance of holding the Crown and the government to account for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609153">There was the refusal to table in the House documents dealing with the espionage that had occurred in a top secret laboratory. We had to order the chief of that agency to the bar to be admonished by the Speaker but the Liberals make sure that they help their own. That member, after being admonished by the House, was shuffled off and given a high-paying job with another agency. That is how accountability works with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609154">We had another election. These guys squeaked their way back in and no sooner did that happen than we had the pandemic. Toward the tail end of the pandemic, they trotted out the ArriveCAN app, an application that did not work and that sent thousands of Canadians to quarantine unnecessarily and in error. We found out that a couple of middlemen made off with millions of dollars. When the parliamentary investigation revealed this, again, the Liberal insiders who were getting rich off this refused to answer questions and had to be brought to the bar again. These were unprecedented steps that had not been resorted to in decades but under the level of corruption of the government, the necessity to obtain information to get to the bottom of scandal after scandal leads us to where we are today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609155">We are at the point, today, where we have the current SDTC crisis, where we have $400 million that has gone out into the pockets of Liberal insiders and questions that remain unanswered, documents that, again, have been ordered by the House. The House voted for the production of these documents. This is not something that Conservatives have just dreamed up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8609156"> This is the House of Commons, where the Conservatives have 121 seats. We do not have enough votes to do this as an act of partisanship. This is what the majority of the House of Commons wants, including members of all parties, except for the Liberals, who, in furtherance of their culture of secrecy, continue to withhold documents. That is why we are seized with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8609157">Liberals say, “If the Conservatives let us kick this over to committee, we could carry on with the business of government.” However, Canadians want a carbon tax election. That is what we want. We need to settle the issue of getting the documents now, and then we can move on to other matters.</ParaText>
