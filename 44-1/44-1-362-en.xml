              <ParaText id="8654780">Mr. Speaker, today, it is my honour to pay tribute to <I>Hanshi</I> Scott Hogarth, an 11-time world champion and black belt in seven martial arts disciplines, a champion of Milton's martial arts community, an inaugural inductee of our local Milton sports hall of fame, a dedicated sensei, a beloved father and husband, and a true master of his craft. Scott passed away peacefully on October 28, surrounded by his family, including his wife, Tammy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8654781">In 1993, Scott opened his dojo in Milton, not only teaching martial arts but also instilling values of respect, discipline and perseverance in countless students for decades since. Scott's larger-than-life presence inspired many, and he was known for his infectious enthusiasm and commitment to the well-being of others. His legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of those he worked with, both in the dojo and in the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8654782">As we remember Scott today, let us celebrate his love of Milton, his extraordinary dedication to our community and the profound impact he had on so many people's lives. He will be dearly missed, but his influence will endure. For my friend Scott, we will always give it 110%. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8654783">Mr. Speaker, two years ago, when I raised concerns about the government's failed drug strategy, I was slammed for giving a voice to Canadians living with the consequences of its failure. This is what happens when we speak truth to the regressive left, so intent is it on protecting policies that sound good but are harmful in practice. It vilifies anyone who challenges its radical ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8654784">This included parents concerned about their children's safety, seniors tired of thefts and break-ins, and business owners fed up with staff being assaulted. We were called NIMBYs, or “not in my backyards”, when the truth is our yards are full of crime, needles and drugs. However, we have persevered in our fight for safer communities, and the Ontario government acted to protect children by closing drug sites within 200 metres of schools and day cares.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8654785">Ontario has taken the first step; it is time for the government to finish the job and to do so now. We can all read the polls. We know the Liberals are going to lose the next election, so they should leave with some dignity, do the right thing, listen to experts and reform safe supply before even more Canadians are hurt.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8654786"> Mr. Speaker, one in 15 Canadians will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Lung cancer affects thousands of Canadian families, including my own. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada, and one of the least survivable, with only a 22% five-year survival rate. Many Canadians would be surprised to know that lung cancer kills more Canadians than prostate cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer combined. It is usually undetectable until its final stages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8654787">Stigma remains because of the association between lung cancer and smoking, which may explain discrepancies in research and treatment funding compared with other cancers. While smoking is a factor in 70% of lung cancer cases, nearly 30% of patients have never smoked. If one has lungs, one can get lung cancer. I ask Canadians to treat all cancer patients with compassion and with the best hopes for new, life-prolonging therapies to add years of survival for our loved ones.</ParaText>

That is why our bold, common-sense Conservative plan to axe the GST on new homes sold was so well received this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8654816">LiUNA says it is good policy. The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness says it is “smart”. The Greater Ottawa Home Builders' Association and BILD in the GTA both say our tax cut would instantly make a significant improvement in housing affordability. It is because on an $800,000 new house, it would save homebuyers $40,000 plus $2,200 a year in mortgage payments, and it would spark 30,000 extra new homes in this country each year.</ParaText>

The Bloc Québécois chose to vote against that dental care program.</ParaText>

Instead, he abandoned them to get back together with the NDP, the party that had kicked him out and changed the locks. He went crawling back to a party so out of touch with Quebec that its lone Quebec MP is desperately looking for an out with the City of Montreal. I feel sorry for Montrealers.

              <ParaText id="8655026">I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to a subject that is affecting millions of Quebeckers and Canadians, and that is the housing crisis. This crisis is raging across the country and having a truly serious impact on a fundamental right, namely the right to decent housing, the right to have a roof over one's head.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655027">Several years ago, my team in Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie and I started an annual tradition of renting a theatre at Cinéma Beaubien, paying for the screening rights to a documentary, and inviting the public to come watch it for free, followed by an opportunity to interact with the artists who produced the film.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655028">This year, about three weeks ago, we screened a very interesting documentary by Diane Bérard and Mathieu Vachon called <I>Le dernier flip: Démarchandiser l'immobilier</I>. It is about the importance of decommodifying real estate, or what is sometimes called the financialization of the housing stock. It was a really important moment. Ms. Bérard and Mr. Vachon were in the room, so we could ask them questions and have a conversation with them. Representatives from the housing committees of Rosemont and La Petite Patrie were also present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655029">There was a lot of interest, because this issue affects everyone. We sold out two screenings. Nearly 500 people in total came out and took the opportunity offered by my office to talk about the housing crisis and, more importantly, about solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655030">Over the past 20 or 30 years, there has been a significant shift towards speculation. Investment funds and trusts are increasingly involved in the purchase and construction of rental housing, and this speculation drives up prices. This is hurting a lot of people. A number of models and solutions are available. One of them is what Bernie Sanders did in Burlington in the early 1980s. People were happy to learn about this solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655031">Bernie Sanders is well known as a socialist United States senator, but before that, he was also the mayor of Burlington. It was during his tenure that the city created what is known as a community land trust. A community land trust is an investment tool. The community land trust and the individual or family wanting to buy a home become co-owners of the investment, so it is a joint investment. The community land trust still owns the land itself, but the person buying the house becomes co-owner of the house. Later on, when the property is sold, the income generated by the sale is shared between the community land trust and the family that was able to benefit from a lower down payment thanks to the trust's support. In the end, the community land trust gets back part of the proceeds of the sale, which it can then use to make another purchase to help another individual, family or student.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655032">This led to some very interesting discussions, because it is a different model that makes it easier to access home ownership. Today, the Champlain Housing Trust owns dozens of houses and apartments in Burlington. This has made it possible to keep the real estate market much more under control and to have prices that truly are much more affordable and accessible for the people living in that community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655033">There are also other models we have often talked about. For example, housing co-operatives provide access to affordable apartments and rent controls, because they belong to everyone and decisions are made collectively. It makes them affordable for people who are not fabulously rich, who cannot afford a condominium or a house on the “open” market. They have access to co-operative housing, which is pleasant to live in because it comes with a sense of community. Residents have to work together to find solutions and decide how they are going to repair or renovate their homes. These types of living arrangements are often very enjoyable. This is one of what we call the “off-market” solutions, because it is a different approach.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655034">The documentary put forward another idea that we in the NDP champion, and that is to use public lands to create truly affordable housing. When I say “truly affordable”, I want to be very clear. For housing to be affordable, its cost must match what a person is able to pay. That does not mean 80% of the average local market price, which leads to ridiculous situations. Three years ago, a two-bedroom apartment in Montreal renting for $2,235 a month was considered affordable by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Housing that costs over $2,000 a month is not affordable. It is not true that hard-working people earning modest incomes can afford housing at that price. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655035">Using public lands to build truly affordable housing should be a priority. This is a tool that works very well. It is starkly different from the Conservatives' idea, which is to sell public lands to private developers and investment firms that will build housing with the sole intention of turning a profit as fast as possible, regardless of people's ability to pay. That is the worst solution anyone could propose, but that is exactly what the Conservatives are doing, because they have tunnel vision that causes them to see just one model, the capitalist model, the model of maximizing investor profit. That is all they see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655036">There are so many alternatives, so many community-based solutions. There is the community land trust that I was just talking about that worked in Burlington. We could also create an acquisition fund. We could use public lands to build affordable housing. We could also have a public fund for buying homes, apartments, duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes. Then we could have democratic public control over rents and prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655037">Do my colleagues know where that has been done? It was done in Vienna, Austria. For years, Vienna has been buying up virtually every house, apartment or building that comes on the market. Today, 60% of Vienna's real estate stock is owned by the city, so rent prices are kept under control. There is none of the speculation that we have been seeing here in Canada over the past 20 or 30 years as a result of the Liberals' and Conservatives' poor decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655038">The documentary <I>Le dernier flip : Démarchandiser l'immobilier</I> talks about a 20% target for off-market apartments and houses. We are not talking about 100%. There will still be a private sector, a private real estate market, as is the case right now, and that is fine. However, the percentage of off-market housing is too low right now. It is around 3%, whereas the target is 20%. If we reach the 20% target, we will be able to stabilize the market. That will have a positive impact on the private market, because it will cool the market down and curb speculation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655039">There is a research group in Montreal called the Institut de recherche et d'informations socioéconomiques, or IRIS, which published a study in June. The current housing crisis is creating many losers. Unfortunately, the study is called “The Big Winners of the Housing Crisis”, because some people have been lining their pockets for years. I am talking about trusts, funds and investment firms, which are benefiting from significant tax incentives and, unfortunately, are only out to make a profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655040">Thirty years ago, almost none of our housing stock was owned by large trusts and investment funds. Today, 20% of Canada's entire housing stock is in the hands of people who are only interested in making money as quickly as possible. That is a big part of the financialization of the real estate market and the housing stock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655041">The IRIS study, much like the efforts in Quebec of FRAPRU, the Front d'action populaire en réaménagement urbain, illustrates just how harmful this is. It hurts renters, because there is not enough rental stock that is truly affordable. We do not have enough off-market housing. I think that is what we need to focus on for the next few years. We need to use public money wisely to rethink our investment model and remind everyone that housing is a right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655077">Mr. Speaker, in response to part (a) of the question,  in recognition of increasing workforce shortages in the health care and social services sectors in rural and remote communities, Budget 2024 committed to expanding the list of eligible occupations for Canada Student Loan, or CSL, forgiveness to 10 new occupations: early childhood educators, dentists, dental hygienists, pharmacists, midwives, personal support workers, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, and teachers. This expansion will ensure all Canadians can benefit from greater access to the health and social services they need, no matter where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655078">Several factors were considered in determining the list of newly eligible professions.Labour market information (e.g., the Canadian Occupational Projection System) was used to identify sectors that are projected to be in shortage in the coming years. In addition, extensive consultations were undertaken with provinces and territories, stakeholders from numerous different professions, and student organizations to ensure their voices were heard while the Government examined various options. The need for enhanced mental health supports, the growing importance of interdisciplinary care, and care services for an aging population were all highlighted as priorities for stakeholders. Additionally, certain occupations were identified as playing key roles in supporting the implementation of Government of Canada priorities, namely the Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care system, the Canadian Dental Care Plan, and the proposed National Pharmacare Plan. While there are numerous other occupations in shortage in rural and remote communities, fiscal consideration was also taken into account. The expansion of the list to add the additional ten new occupations balances both fiscal prudence and health and social service shortages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655079">With regard to part (b), a variety of occupations were examined as part of the process of assessing an expansion to the list of professionals eligible for CSL Forgiveness. This included various health and social service occupations that deliver primary care, interdisciplinary health care, and technical/supporting services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655080">With regard to part (c), numerous occupations are in-demand in rural and remote communities. As noted in the response to (a), several factors were considered to determine the proposed ten new occupations, including labour market information, stakeholder feedback, complementarity with other efforts to address workforce shortages in healthcare and in social services, and financial considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655081">With regard to part (d), the total cost of the loan forgiveness measure over four years, from 2025-26 to 2028-29, is $301.7 million dollars. While Budget 2024 did not provide the cost breakdown by profession, Employment and Social Development Canada officials are currently working on a Regulatory submission, which will disaggregate some of the costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655082">With regard to part (e), as the profession of occupational therapists was not retained for the Budget 2024 proposal on Canada Student Loan forgiveness, no cost was estimated for the budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655085">Adjustments were made to the baseline projections of capital gains realizations to account for some filers choosing to realize capital gains prior to the effective date of June 25, 2024, leaving less capital gains in future years that would have otherwise been subject to the higher inclusion rate had they not been pulled forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655086">The simulation models account for, among other things: changes in the inclusion rate on net capital gains and stock options subject to the $250,000 threshold, the inclusion rate for allowable business investment losses, adjustment factors applied to net capital losses of prior years, Alternative Minimum Tax calculations, and the value of the lifetime capital gains exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655087">In addition, it was assumed that the higher inclusion rate for corporations would result in a reduction in the capital dividend account, and a greater value of taxable dividends paid out by corporations to be taxed in the hands of individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655088">Furthermore, an adjustment factor was applied to the model output to account for additional behavioural responses to the reform, i.e. retiming of capital gains realizations across years after 2024, changes in the allocation of assets to fixed income investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655089">As for part (b), the Department of Finance’s modelling tools leverage historical personal, trust and corporate income tax filing data from the Canada Revenue Agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655090">The growth rates for key income variables, including capital gains and stock options, are based on the same departmental projection model that is used to forecast key fiscal and economic variables for the federal budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655092">Mr. Speaker, as part of its effort to fulfill Canada’s G20 commitment to phase out or rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, on July 24, 2023, the Government of Canada released the Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies (IFFS) Government of Canada Self-Review Assessment Framework and the Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies Government of Canada Guidelines. The Framework provides a definition of a fossil fuel subsidy and the methodology for assessing efficiency, while the Guidelines prevent the creation of any new inefficient subsidies. The Framework and Guidelines were jointly developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Department of Finance Canada and apply to all federal departments and agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655093">Consistent with the Inefficient Fossil Fuel Subsidies Government of Canada Self-Review Assessment Framework, the Government of Canada has phased out or rationalized the following nine tax measures supporting the fossil fuel sector: phase-out of the accelerated capital cost allowance for oil sands (announced in Budget 2007);reduction in the deduction rates for intangible capital expenses in oil sands projects to align with rates in conventional oil and gas sector (announced in Budget 2011); phase-out of the Atlantic Investment Tax Credit for investments in the oil and gas and mining sectors (announced in Budget 2012); reduction in the deduction rate for pre-production intangible mine development expenses to align with rate for the oil and gas sector (announced in Budget 2013); phase-out of the accelerated capital cost allowance for mining (announced in Budget 2013); allowing the accelerated capital cost allowance for liquefied natural gas facilities to expire as scheduled in 2025 (announced in Budget 2016); rationalize the tax treatment of expenses for successful oil and gas exploratory drilling (announced in Budget 2017); phase out tax preference that allows small oil and gas companies to reclassify certain development expenses as more favorably treated exploration expenses (announced in Budget 2017); and, phase-out of flow-through shares for oil, gas, and coal activities (announced in Budget 2022).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655094">Canada is currently developing a self-review report which will include information on all identified federal fossil fuel subsidies and its self-assessment against the IFFS Framework. These reports will be made public before the end of 2024.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655096">Mr. Speaker, in response to part (a) of the question, the pilot heatwave attribution system is based directly on a published event attribution analysis of a heatwave which occurred in May 2023 in Alberta. Since the pilot system began running in March 2024, it has been applied to a range of moderate heatwaves in regions across Canada over the period March – June 2024. These have been used to evaluate the system, but the results have not been published.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655097">With regard to part (b), research is going on this year to expand the system to allow attribution of cold extremes, and precipitation extremes. Applying rapid event attribution to cold extremes is a technically straightforward update to the existing system but requires research to ensure that the climate models used are able to simulate these events realistically. Attribution of precipitation extremes requires evaluation of observational datasets, and more in-depth model evaluation. We plan to include these variables in the rapid event attribution system by the end of March 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655098">With regard to part (c), Environment and Climate Change Canada has collaborated with Natural Resources Canada to carry out an event attribution study of the 2023 Canadian wildfire season which has been submitted to a scientific journal but has not yet been peer reviewed. It is anticipated that this study could be used as a basis for attribution of future extreme wildfire seasons on an expedited timeline, compared to many months for a typical analysis. Such analyses are typically applied to a whole fire season, rather than individual wildfires. Research on rapid event attribution of flooding across Canada is a part of the rapid event attribution project and it will be developed in the next two to five years. Droughts tend to be longer-term phenomena that are not as well suited to rapid attribution. We do not currently have plans to include drought in the rapid event attribution system, but attribution of drought is a subject for future research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655099">Much of this research is taking place at Environment and Climate Change Canada offices at the University of Victoria, in Victoria.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655104">Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of Canadians is Health Canada’s top priority, and the department exercises stringent regulatory oversight over vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines. Before a vaccine is approved in Canada, the department conducts a rigorous scientific review of its safety, efficacy and quality. Submissions filed by vaccine manufacturers typically contain extensive data regarding the vaccine's safety, efficacy and quality, including results of pre-clinical and clinical studies, details on manufacturing processes, and information on adverse events following immunization. For your information, the clinical data that was submitted in support of the approval of COVID-19 vaccine by manufacturers, can be found on the Clinical Information Portal. An authorization was only issued when anticipated benefits of the vaccine outweighed the potential risks of its use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655105">The mRNA in the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines provides instructions for how to make the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein triggers an immune response. The body then prepares antibodies and cells that help fight the virus if it enters the body in the future. Additional details on how the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work ca be found at COVID 19 mRNA vaccines – Canada.ca. The vaccines have demonstrated to be highly effective in prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655106">Studies on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the drug product were conducted and were submitted as part of the pre-clinical and early clinical trial phase data packages that companies are required to submit to regulatory agencies, including Health Canada. The pre-clinical data provided by the companies demonstrated that vaccine-produced spike protein is rapidly broken down and does not persist in the body. These data were analyzed by Health Canada prior to authorizations being granted for the COVID 19 vaccines. The outcomes of some of these studies can be found in the Summary Basis of Decision for each product, available on the COVID 19 vaccines and treatments portal.</ParaText>

Health Canada has a rigorous scientific review system in place to ensure vaccines are safe and effective in preventing the diseases they target. More information on these standards and how Health Canada regulates vaccines for human use in Canada can be found at https://bit.ly/36xea3C. Once vaccines are authorized, Health Canada releases information about the vaccine, including summaries of the data considered by Health Canada. This includes non-clinical, clinical and other studies, as well as how the decision was made. This information can be found on Health Canada’s website at http://bit.ly/30LJM2z.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655110">The evaluation of toxicity of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was focused on the vaccines themselves, the components and the delivery system. In non-clinical studies, the toxicity of vaccines was tested either as the whole product containing the delivery system as marketed in Canada, medicinal ingredients, i.e COVID-19 antigens, or non-medicinal ingredients, including the components in the formulation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655111">Polyethylene glycol, or PEG, is an ingredient that is widely used in cosmetics, food products, and pharmaceuticals.

Health Canada continues to monitor the safety profile of health products once they are on the Canadian market, to help ensure that the benefits of the product continue to outweigh the risks. The safety profile of these products is monitored by reviewing safety information submitted by manufacturers as well as considering safety information from international regulators. When new safety issues are confirmed by the department, Health Canada takes action, which may include communicating new risks to Canadians and healthcare professionals or changing the recommended use of the product. In addition, Health Canada and the PHAC have been actively monitoring and reviewing reports of adverse events following immunization, or AEFI, reported to the Canada Vigilance Program of Health Canada and the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System of the PHAC. This information is published on the Government of Canada’s website. It is important to note that these reports do not necessarily imply that a relationship between the adverse event and the vaccine has been established.

              <ParaText id="8655136">Mr. Speaker, with regard to parts (a) to (k), the health and safety of Canadians are Health Canada’s top priority and the department exercises stringent regulatory oversight over biologics, including vaccines. Before any of the COVID-19 vaccines were approved in Canada, the department conducted rigorous scientific review of the extensive data regarding the vaccines’ safety, efficacy and quality, including results of preclinical and clinical studies, details on manufacturing processes and information on adverse events following immunization. An authorization was only issued when the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweighed the risks of its use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655137">For all products authorized by Health Canada, the summary basis of decision is published on the website https://dhpp.hpfb-dgpsa.ca/review-documents. This document details the clinical and preclinical data analyzed and provides a rationale for the review decision. Furthermore, as part of the regulatory requirements, a product monograph is publicly released at the time of a vaccine’s authorization. A product monograph is a factual, scientific document on the drug product that, devoid of promotional material, describes the properties, claims, indications and conditions of use for the drug, and contains any other information that may be required for optimal, safe and effective use of the drug. It is used to inform physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, other health care professionals and patients about the appropriate use of the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655138">The product monograph is developed and managed by the manufacturer. The content, wordings and format are carefully reviewed by Health Canada to ensure that it is prepared in accordance with the guidance. Each publicly available Canadian product monograph can be consulted by accessing the drug product database at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-product-database.html. It describes the specific evaluation methods and data used to assess safety and effectiveness for each product. As part of this assessment, Health Canada relies on clinical trials that are assessed against established international and national standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655139">At the time of authorization, the safety information included in the product monograph and in package inserts is based on the available safety data from clinical trials. Furthermore, Health Canada is responsible for ensuring that the product monograph and package inserts are updated over time to adequately reflect the risks associated with the vaccines that are authorized in Canada. Health Canada-approved information is used by appropriate bodies, such as provincial and local public health authorities, to guide recommendations, vaccine use, as well as information provided to vaccine recipients. The product monograph also contains a list of adverse reactions observed during clinical trials for the product. Each drug product authorized for sale in Canada has labelling that reflects Health Canada's assessment of the product at the time of approval.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655140">For new drug submissions, the product sponsor proposes a therapeutic indication supported by clinical trials and other data. During review of the submission, Health Canada conducts its assessment. A drug’s pharmacological mechanism of action is considered within this context. It is noted that no health product is without risks. Adverse events from the clinical trials submitted by the sponsor are carefully assessed, considered within the context of the condition treated or prevented by the product, and labelled in the product monograph, linked above.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655141">Following authorization, Canada has a robust and well-established vaccine safety surveillance system involving Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, the provinces and territories, and vaccine manufacturers. Health Canada continues to monitor the safety profile of health products once they are in the Canadian market, to help ensure that the benefits of the products continue to outweigh the risks. The safety profile of these products is monitored by reviewing safety information submitted by manufacturers and by considering safety information from international regulators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655142">In addition, Health Canada and PHAC have been actively monitoring and reviewing reports of adverse events following immunization, or AEFIs, reported to the Canada vigilance program, or CVP, of Health Canada and the Canadian adverse events following immunization surveillance system of PHAC. Adverse events of special interest, or AESIs, which are potentially associated with vaccine products, must also be carefully monitored and confirmed by further evaluation. Information on AEFIs and AESIs is published on the Government of Canada’s website at https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccine-safety/.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655143">It is important to note that these reports do not necessarily imply that a relationship between the adverse event and the vaccine has been established. However, they are an important information source supporting ongoing safety monitoring. When new safety issues are confirmed by the department, Health Canada takes action, which may include communicating new risks to Canadians and health care professionals or changing the recommended use of the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655144">The Brighton Collaboration, or BC, was established in 2001 to provide standardized, validated and objective methods for monitoring the safety profile and benefit-to-risk ratios of vaccines. This includes the development of globally implemented case definitions, guidance and protocols for data collection and comparability within and across clinical trials, surveillance systems, and post-licensure clinical studies. Health Canada has been implementing the BC criteria on case definition when assessing AEFI reports retrieved from the CVP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655145">Information about AEFIs reported in Canada, including the BC criteria, is published on the Government of Canada’s website at https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccine-safety/.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655146">With respect to product quality, Health Canada performs a thorough review of manufacturing processes and controls. Impurity levels in all product types are controlled by predetermined limits in place during product manufacturing and before the product is released onto the market. Health Canada ensures that scientifically justified methods are in place to monitor impurities and that the limits set are appropriate to ensure the safety of patients. The impurities are adequately controlled by the existing control system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655147">Agile licensing for drugs and medical devices are regulatory amendments being proposed to the food and drug regulations and the medical devices regulations. The agile regulatory proposal was pre-published in the Canada Gazette, part I, for a 130-day consultation, which closed on April 26, 2023. The proposed regulations are intended to reduce irritants and regulatory roadblocks to innovation by introducing regulations that are more agile and internationally aligned increasing postmarket oversight without compromising premarket rigour. The measures that will be introduced as part of these modernization efforts will not lessen Health Canada’s commitment to the health and safety of Canadians. The department will continue to require the same high standards of evidence about the safety, efficacy and quality of drugs and medical devices prior to authorization for sale and once on market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655148">Health Canada is targeting a fall 2024 Treasury Board date, with publication of the finalized regulations in the Canada Gazette, part II. As these amendments have not yet received Governor in Council approval, they are not currently considered under the regulations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655157">Mr. Speaker, climate change is an existential challenge, and climate action is critical to Canada’s long term health and economic prosperity. Carbon pricing is widely recognized as the most efficient means of reducing our greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, which is why the Government of Canada continues to make sure that it is not free to pollute in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655158">The federal price on pollution is revenue-neutral for the federal government; all of the direct proceeds from the federal carbon pricing system remain in the province or territory where they are collected. Put simply, every dollar collected from the carbon price is returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655159">The fuel charge is generally paid at the producer or distributor level and passed on to purchasers as part of the price paid for fuel. Monthly fuel charge returns only account for aggregate amounts by fuel type and by province or territory. Typically, once the fuel charge has been paid by a fuel producer or distributor, there is no further reporting of who ultimately bears the cost of the federal fuel charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655160">In the provinces where the fuel charge applies, the majority of households receive more with the Canada carbon rebate than they incur in carbon pricing-related costs. The government reports the direct fuel charge proceeds collected and returned annually through the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act annual report. For more information on the proceeds collected and returned, please see the annual report for 2022 at the following website: https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.893583/publication.html.</ParaText>

Since 1999, the Chinese government has persecuted Falun Gong practitioners in the thousands, perhaps even millions. </ParaText>

Her family was not notified of her arrest, making this a case of forced disappearance. Her family has called on the Shandong provincial prison administration many times to inquire about Yunhe, and the prison administration remains silent on this matter, in a clear dereliction of duty. Zhang Yunhe has not been seen and there have been no reports on her since her arrest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655243">Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655244">The first one is in regard to Falun Gong practitioners who have been persecuted in China since 1999 by the CCP, which launched a campaign to have the faith eradicated in China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655245"> L.I. Yongmei is the mother of Suting Li, a resident of Calgary. L.I. Yongmei received her second prison sentence in 2023, for five years, because she is a practitioner of Falun Gong. Her phone was monitored for six months and her home was ransacked by police. She was strung up by her wrists with her feet in the air during the interrogation. She was first arrested in 2014 and was incarcerated from 2015 to 2017, when she was subjected to torture. She refused to renounce her faith or admit any guilt, and as such, she endured extended periods of squatting and standing, and had freezing cold water poured on her. She was deprived of food and sleep. She was forced to do unpaid labour and was made to sleep on a bare bed board with no blankets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655246">Therefore, the petitioners request that the Canadian Parliament and government pass a resolution to establish measures to stop the Chinese Communist regime's crime of systematically imprisoning Falun Gong practitioners, amend Canadian legislation to combat forced organ harvesting and publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China.</ParaText>

Since the CCP's rule of China, it has implemented state atheism and perceived religion and believers as a threat to its rule. This is why in 1999 the CCP initiated a campaign of persecution against perhaps millions of Falun Gong practitioners due to the practice's growing popularity in the country.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8655264"> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> for bringing forward the very important debate today and for showing how members from the NDP continue to work for Canadians while the Conservatives continue to debate themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655265">The promise of the free market was the promise of opportunities for people. People were told that the market would bring competition, but that is not what it brought. What it has brought is corporate collusion, which has made life more expensive for everyday people while corporate CEOs are taking home millions in bonuses. There has been collusion in the grocery industry and now in rental housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655266">The Liberals and the Conservatives put all of the housing eggs in the market basket. Forty years ago they walked away from social housing, from purpose-built rental housing and from co-op housing. The market was supposed to build homes for people. It was supposed to create the stable rental housing that 30% of Canadians need. It has not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655267">Instead, the market has reached peak greed and collusion in rental housing, leading to evictions, displacements, encampments and a growing number of Canadians living rough. Even seniors and persons with disabilities cannot escape the free market and are not protected from corporate greed with the Liberals and Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655268"> Thanks to the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, the financialization of housing in Canada was brought to the forefront, including through the study we are debating today from HUMA. The financialization of housing is the largest driver of housing unaffordability and homelessness in this country. Investors are turning homes for Canadians into financial assets that are pushing ordinary people out of the housing market and only profiting rich, real estate CEOs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655269">One-third of what should be stable and affordable rental housing for people has been purchased in recent years by private investors. In some cities this problem gets even larger, with nearly half of all purpose-built rentals being owned by wealthy investors. The committee heard from the federal housing advocate and leading researchers like Martine August how the financialization of housing is reshaping our communities and undermining the very fabric of our society as more and more people cannot afford a home. We are seeing this manifest in encampments across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655270"> Housing is increasingly being treated as a commodity and a financial asset rather than as the fundamental human right that it is. When housing becomes a vehicle for profit maximization for the few, it harms the majority. The Liberal government, and the Conservatives before it, stopped focusing on providing safe, secure and affordable homes for Canadians. They have purposely laid the groundwork for the largest corporations and landlords to drive up their profit margins on the backs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655271"> New Democrats have raised the alarm about this. There is endless proof that financialized landlords raise rents faster and higher than other landlords, and they file for more evictions than any other landlord type. This practice has become so prevalent that my NDP colleagues, the members for <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> and for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, have written to the Competition Bureau to investigate collusion on rent-fixing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655272">Landlords are now at the point where they are suing their tenants for libel when tenants speak out on unfair rental practices. Who is protecting those tenants from lawsuits? It is not the Liberals nor the Conservatives. It is only the New Democrats who are standing up for Canadians and not for the wealthy CEOs who are taking away their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655273">The problem is magnified when the Liberals and the Conservatives continue to team up in committee to protect corporate landlords by not agreeing to NDP motions to have landlords come to committee to talk about their unfair tactics. Shame on the Liberals and the Conservatives for putting wealthy CEOs ahead of people and their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655274">The government led the financialization of housing, and it led its pension fund investments' doing exactly the same thing. The Liberals are heavily involved in the financialization of housing, whether it is through the CPP or the public service pension fund. Canadian pension plans are increasingly investing in and buying up affordable housing and then partnering with corporate landlords like Starlight to extract maximum profits.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655275">An access to information request found that PSP Investments owns rental housing and has hired a corporate landlord to raise rents above guidelines, evict tenants and kick them out on the street. The Liberal government is doing that. Tenants have been forced to organize rent strikes to fight back against these unfair practices. I wonder whether the government will sue them as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655276"> Now, to make it even more unfair, the Liberal government has okayed the use of AI rental collusion software by its asset managers. The same algorithmic pricing tools that are part of an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. for allegedly being used to price-fix are now being used by the same asset managers the government has hired: firms that go after tenants. AI software like YieldStar and Yardi are working with the Canadian government through corporate landlords.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655277"> AI in the marketplace is like all technology: a promise. When used correctly, it can make our lives easier, healthier and better, but it can also be used by bad-faith actors to crush competition and hurt renters. AI poses new challenges that make the potential scale of price-fixing something we have never seen. As more and more industries use AI to optimize their prices, we are only going to see the problem more and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655278">The technology has the power to undermine the very foundation of fair competition in the rental market by simply creating an AI-central planning that serves only the wealthy, and it is already happening. The federal housing advocate told our committee about how the financialization of housing is a serious human rights issue that must be addressed, and now with the introduction of tools like AI, human rights are pushed even further behind. It has the greatest potential to cause harm to indigenous and disadvantaged groups, such as vulnerable seniors, low-income tenants, people with disabilities, recent immigrants, refugees and lone-parent families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655279">The financialization of housing does not have to be an inevitable fate; it is a choice of Liberals and Conservatives. The Liberals have the power to prioritize the well-being of people and ensure that every Canadian can find a place to call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655280">The report we are discussing today sheds light on the consequences of financialization. It points to alarming rates of evictions, skyrocketing rental prices and the increasing prevalence of precarious housing for Canadians, but the recommendations in the report are minimal. That is why the NDP filed a dissenting report outlining the actions the government could take to make housing a human right. The government has to act now. That is why I am going to move:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8655301"> Mr. Speaker, these are interesting times. There is no doubt about that in terms of what takes place in Parliament nowadays. We have before us, once again, a concurrence motion. It is a really important issue. It is one of those issues that I would suggest Canadians are very concerned about. Ultimately, no government in the history of Canada has actually invested more real dollars in a sector than the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and government; it has never seen as much cash and other resources flow to it. That is the reality of the situation, whether opposition members want to recognize it or not. I will expand on that at great length shortly, but I also want to provide a comment in terms of where we are as a Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655302">Colleagues will know that we have not had any sort of discussion on legislative bills that are before the House, which are some very important pieces of legislation. Some of it would be direct, and maybe more so indirect, even dealing with the issue that we have before us today. Instead, we have seen different forms of things brought to the floor in order to prevent that discussion or debate from occurring. The best example we can give is the one where the Conservative Party moved a motion that “the government's failure of fully providing documents, as ordered by the House on June 10, 2024, be hereby referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.” The reason I mention it is that it is important to realize why, in good part, we are actually debating the report that we are debating today. It is because the Conservatives, in their wisdom or lack thereof, have decided to prevent any sort of debate on a wide spectrum of issues by filibustering their own motion. Since they have been doing that, we have seen members of the Bloc and the New Democratic Party actually bring in concurrence reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655303">In the past, I was very critical of concurrence reports being brought in, but I can appreciate the frustration of other political entities inside the House. Like me, they have been seeing the Conservatives playing games and denying Canadians the opportunity to hear a lot of positive debate and votes take place on issues that are critically important to them. I find that unfortunate. I hope that, at some point in time, we will be able to acknowledge that there are important issues in concurrence motions. We know that there are actually well over 100 reports out there. We could spend every day from now until September 2025 talking about a concurrence report. Some might be a little more interesting than others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655304">I like this concurrence report in the sense that it is relevant to an issue that Canadians are concerned about. It provides us the opportunity to get some of the things that the federal government is actually doing on the record. The unfortunate reality of it, however, is that it continues to support and allow for the Conservative Party to ultimately filibuster the very simple motion that was put to the House. All members of the House actually want to see the motion voted on, except for the Conservatives, so that we are better able to deal with the important issues that Canadians have to face and deal with.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655305">That is why, day in and day out, we are appealing to the Conservative Party to start putting the interests of Canadians ahead of the leadership ambitions of the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party in general here in Ottawa. We hope that, over the next number of days, weeks and whatever it takes, the Conservatives become a bit more sensitized to the issues that Canadians are facing. We hope that they will ultimately work with other political entities in the chamber so that we can have the types of debates it is necessary to have here on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655306"> Having said all that, housing is a very big issue. I recognize that. There is nothing new there. We know that housing has needed to be looked at, not only for this year but also in previous years. We made a bold start on the housing file a number of years ago. When I started off, I said that no other prime minister or government has done more in terms of contributing to the bigger picture of housing in Canada than the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and government. That is a fact. No government has worked as diligently as the current government has with provinces, territories, indigenous communities, every region of the country and the many different stakeholders out there. As a government, we have been very proactive on the housing file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655307">We could contrast what we have done with previous governments. Even better yet, let us contrast the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the leader of the Liberal Party, on the issue of the housing file. It does not take very much to expand on what the leader of the Conservative Party did. He was actually the housing minister when Stephen Harper was the prime minister. We have had many ministers talk about how enthusiastic the leader of the Conservative Party was with respect to housing when he was the minister of housing. He actually built six houses in Canada. Now, to the best of my knowledge, we have not found any of those six houses, but we are told that that he actually built six houses as minister of housing. That is a pretty impressive background. If we contrast that with what the leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister of Canada, has done, people would get a better understanding and appreciation of who really understands the needs and the housing-related issues as a leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655308"> Yesterday, we were entertained with a Conservative idea. The Conservatives do not have very many of them, but we had one that floated to the top yesterday. It is a rare occurrence. What the Conservatives are saying now is that, if we bought a house for $900,000, we would not have to pay the GST on that house. That is the Conservatives' gift to the housing situation that Canada is facing today. At the same time, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> says that they would also cut back on other federal programs dealing with housing. I found it interesting that the leader of the Conservative Party today said that they are helping homelessness. It raises the following question: How many people in homeless shelters do they think are going to benefit by building a $900,000 home in the next year or so? I suspect that it will not be any of them. I do not quite understand the Conservatives' policy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655309"> Maybe the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> got the idea when we said we were going to get rid of the GST on purpose-built rentals. Not only was that well received in Canada, but provincial jurisdictions did likewise for the PST. That in itself is going to lead to thousands of units being built across the country. That was a very strong and positive announcement from the Government of Canada, and now the leader of the Conservative Party is saying the Conservatives have a better idea, that they are going to give a break on GST to those buying brand new houses, putting in a cap of a million dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655310">How does that deal with affordable housing? I can say right offhand that it deals with it in a very negative way, because while he is talking about this shiny new Conservative program, he will also be cutting programs that are going to build more affordable housing across Canada. Their policy statement does not make any sense, unless there is a theme that he wants to develop, the theme of axing the tax. I saw the motions he made today, moving his arm up and down. I see him do that inside and outside the House when he talks about axing the tax. He believes that he can fool Canadians. That is what this is about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655311">He is trying to give an impression that Canadians are going to benefit because he is going to axe the GST for those building brand new houses. How many Canadians are going to benefit by that major policy announcement, particularly those who need affordable housing, especially when we factor in that he is going to cancel other programs? Interestingly enough, the Conservatives are critical, publicly and here in the House, of the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> with regard to the accelerator fund. They say it is one of the programs they are going to axe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655312">If we look at National Newswatch, we become very familiar with a number of the members of the Conservative caucus who disagree, at least those who wrote the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation>, with what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> is saying. We got letters from Conservatives asking, in essence, for additional support on the housing file, appealing to the Minister of Housing for support on the initiative in their ridings. I applaud those members. They are doing what they should be doing in advocating for their constituents, even though their leader is advocating to get rid of the program. I find something odd about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655313">I know of at least five Conservatives who did this, and I understand there are potentially even more, as a number of communities are affected. I sure hope the letter was good. What do the member for <Affiliation DbId="278254" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278115" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278214" Type="2">Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola</Affiliation> have in common? I suspect there are more, but here are the five we know of. They all have two things in common. One is that they are all Conservatives, and two, they all want the government program that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> wants to get rid of, as he said in his announcement yesterday. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655314">Today, time after time, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> stood in his place and said how good he is because of what so-and-so is saying about his announcement. At the end of the day, the Conservatives need to rethink their housing policy. While they are doing that, they might also want to rethink their price on pollution policy, because they have had a few flip-flops on it. I would suggest that if they wants to do the environment a favour, they should have yet another flip-flop. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655315">Shortly after coming into government, we established the national housing strategy. We can think of the affordable housing initiative and the rapid housing initiative too. Through supports of that nature, we were able to repair, renew and see the construction of literally tens of thousands of homes in different regions in Canada. We are providing loans and more to ensure that capital gets off the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655316"> We can talk about the support for non-profit, low-income housing that has been ongoing. The federal government provides hundreds of millions in subsidies to ensure that people can afford to live in non-profit housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655317">We have other programs that might not be as direct as one would like to see but are very important. I am thinking of the greener homes program, which provides support to individuals who want to make their homes more energy efficient. That was taken up by thousands of Canadians throughout the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655318">As a government, we believe in co-op housing and support it in a very tangible way. We want to see more co-op homes being built, because there is a difference between being a resident of a co-op and being a tenant in an apartment block. If I had more time, I would go into that in much greater detail. We also have the housing accelerator fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655319"> There is a fundamental difference between the Conservatives and the Liberals. We understand that the federal government has a strong leadership role to play on housing, and we are doing just that. However, we have to work with municipalities, provinces, territories, indigenous communities and the wide spectrum of stakeholders out there, like Habitat for Humanity, which does fantastic work. I suspect it has built more new homes in Winnipeg North, in particular in areas that are more challenged, than any other organization, including government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655320">Stakeholders play a very important role, and we have been there to support them. Whether it is the <Affiliation DbId="278943" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we are constantly looking for ways, working with the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> and caucus colleagues, to bring up ideas on how we can improve Canada's housing stock and expand it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655321">I remember the housing accelerator fund opportunity. It was great when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to Winnipeg. He, the premier and the mayor of Winnipeg talked about how, by working together, all three levels of government were going to be able to accomplish so much more. These are the types of things we need to see more of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655322">That is where the challenge is for the members opposite. We have invested. We understand the issue. We know that more work still needs to be done. However, they cannot tell me that any other national government in history, throughout the generations, has done more on the housing file than the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government. That does not mean things are perfect; it means that we will continue to work for Canadians on this very serious issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655323"> I would appeal in particular to the Conservative Party to stop the games it is playing on the floor of the House of Commons. Let us get to work for Canadians and put our party interests behind the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>

Having said that, I believe there is a role for our standing committees there, especially after yesterday's announcement, when the official opposition said the best way to deal with housing in the country is to give a tax break to people building houses under a million dollars.

I also think we need to see the different levels of government come to the table to look at how we can build more homes and have them be non-profit houses and units. There is a need there.

The reality is that she does not do that in the House when it comes to these programs. Instead, during question period and at every other opportunity, she tells us repeatedly that the government is failing her constituents. Then, behind everybody's back, she writes a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> saying, “Can we please get some of this money because we see value in this program.” It is the exact same thing the members for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="278115" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278214" Type="2">Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola</Affiliation> are doing.</ParaText>

The CMHC says we need “increased participation from the private sector” to meet these goals.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655359"> Our dissenting report continues, “Conservative members support 60 day average approvals at the CMHC, linking bonuses for CMHC executives to performance metrics, and balancing the budget to lower interest rates so that we can unleash” non-governmental organizations and others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655360"> Here are a few points that I want to make at the onset of this debate here today. I would like to set the template for where housing is in Canada right now. Under the Liberal government, housing has never been more expensive. The Liberals' failure to build homes has created a housing crisis for Canadians. In fact, the House of Commons has said that we are in a housing crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655361">The cost of mortgage payments and down payments have all doubled under the Liberal government, or we could say the NDP-Liberal government because the NDP has been supporting the Liberals. It previously took 25 years to pay off a mortgage, whereas now it actually takes 25 years to save for a down payment. This is one of the reasons young adults, so many of them in the country, are saying that they feel they will never be able to afford a mortgage. It is very demotivating and really frustrating for our young adults here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655362"> The Liberals' record on housing, mortgages and rents is really nothing for them to be proud of. Instead of building homes that Canadians need, they have been building more bureaucracy. We hear a lot about the bureaucracy of the federal housing agency, the CMHC, at the housing committee. We have done a number of studies recently, and we have had a lot of testimony from different witnesses talking about how the federal housing agency will add costs because of certain building rules that it has put in place, which are far and above actual requirements. It will also add in a number of other rules, which can actually add a lot of cost, time and delays onto building the housing. We have heard quite a bit about this at the housing committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655363"> We also know that, nine years after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to lower the price of housing, rents and mortgages have doubled, and middle-class Canadians are being forced to live in tent encampments. In nearly every city across the country, we are seeing a record number of tent encampments opening. However, the photo ops that we have seen from the Liberal government will not come anywhere near to building the 5.8 million homes that are needed to restore housing affordability in Canada. As a result, home prices have doubled, rent has doubled, down payments have doubled and mortgages have also doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655364"> There was a report done by CMHC earlier in October that showed that housing starts continue to trend lower while Canada's population has rapidly increased. When we compare September 2024 to September 2023, the results are even worse. Across the country, housing starts were down 15% this September compared to September 2023. Similarly, in Canada's most expensive cities, the Liberal government's billion-dollar photo op fund has really done nothing to build more homes because housing starts are actually down 20% in Vancouver and Toronto.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655365">Statistics Canada also recently reported that the total value of building permits increased by 7% in August of this year. As well, Rentals.ca recently published its national rent report, which shows the consequences of the Liberal failure. This means the cost of rent has massively outpaced Canadian paycheques. It is just one bad statistic after another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655366">We can look at homelessness, which is an issue in my community of Kelowna—Lake Country and across the country. The Parliamentary Budget Officer released a detailed report in May of this year outlining the state of homelessness in Canada. The Liberal government committed to eliminating chronic homelessness by 2030. However, according to this report, since 2018, chronic homelessness has actually increased by 38%. The report also stated that the number of individuals living in unsheltered locations has increased by a staggering 38%. These are not just statistics. These are people. These are family members. These are neighbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655367"> What I would like to discuss now is a recent announcement made by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> about a plan that Conservatives have to lower the cost for Canadians looking to buy a home. Our common-sense Conservative leader announced that we would axe the federal sales tax, or the GST, as it is called, on new homes sold for under $1 million. This cut would save $40,000, or $2,200 per year, in mortgage payments on an $800,000 house, as an example. This tax cut would spark 30,000 extra homes being built every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655368">Common-sense Conservatives would also push provinces to remove their sales tax from new home sales, which would save tens of thousands of dollars more for homebuyers. The move really comes after this housing crisis, as I have mentioned, has doubled housing costs over the nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, which is faster than in any other G7 country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655369">Back in October of 2015, the month before the Liberals were elected, it took only 39% of the median pre-tax household income to cover home ownership costs. Now it takes nearly 60%. That is a staggering difference and a staggering amount for Canadian families. While it used to be normal for working-class youth to buy homes, now 80% of Canadians tell pollsters that home ownership is only for the very, very rich.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655370">The GST alone adds about $50,000 in cost to a $1-million home. This common-sense Conservative tax reduction would really eliminate billions of dollars in bureaucratic programs that the Liberals admit have not built a single home. That is what will be offset by the difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655371"> As I mentioned, this tax cut would spark extra homes being built. What is really missing here is the promise of Canada, where many of us are of the generation that, when we were in our 20s, if we had a decent job, we could have a decent car, save up and buy our first place. That dream of home ownership is really gone now for our young Canadians, and it is incredibly sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655372"> We also know that, in addition to that, we have record-breaking numbers of people going to food banks. It was just reported that now two million people are going to food banks a month. It is just incredibly hard for young adults and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655373">On our Conservative proposal, I would like to mention a couple of quotes here. Canadian housing expert Mike Moffat, senior director of policy and innovation of the Smart Prosperity Institute, said, “[This] proposal to eliminate the GST for newly constructed homes selling for under $1 million is the boldest middle-class housing proposal released to date from any federal political party. It will put $4 billion back into the pockets of homebuyers each year.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655374"> The Greater Ottawa Home Builders' Association said, “Increasing the GST Rebate threshold will support affordability, increase housing supply, and restore fairness to current and future generations of homebuyers”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655375">There are more quotes as well. I know that I am running out of time, but this is really important, and we hope that the government will follow the proposal made by Conservatives to axe the federal tax on new housing sold for under $1 million.</ParaText>

We have a government that put forward nearly $100 billion and its record is that housing costs have doubled, rent has doubled and the ability for a young person to save up for a home, let alone afford rent, has gone beyond their reach. If we have ever seen a government mismanage a portfolio so badly, it is indeed the Liberal government's approach to housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655387">Where I live in British Columbia, many Canadians mourn the fact that they will never have the opportunity to own a home. In fact, they feel helpless. The Canada they once knew is not the Canada of today, primarily because of how the government has attempted to tackle housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655388">For example, in the Fraser Valley right now, the average cost of a townhouse is $750,000. A down payment for a townhouse, modestly, would be about $55,000 to cover the down payment, maybe some of the legal costs and real estate fees. If we took a very fortunate young Canadian who was making a salary of about $85,000, in British Columbia, that would give them take-home pay of about $5,300 a month and change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655389">However, let us look at what the cost of living is today. If someone is commuting to work and their gas bill is $100 a week, they are spending $400 on gas every single month. They have to pay ICBC insurance. That is about $125 if they are a good driver. For a phone bill and Internet bill, they are looking at about $160. For gas and hydro for a home, they are looking at about $120. For a single person, they are looking at around $750 a month for food; $150 a month for clothing, toiletries and maybe some basic household items; $500 for a car payment and maybe some miscellaneous costs; and $2,500 for the average rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655390">Now, this is a modest understanding of what the average, young single person in Canada is facing. I did not even talk about the cost of student loans or other debt that they might be paying off on a monthly basis. If we tabulate all those numbers, on that salary of $5,300 and change, they are going to be left with about $650 at the end of the month to save up for a home. At that rate, it is going to take them about seven years and a month to save up for a down payment. That is actually a pretty accurate scenario. It is similar to what my wife and I had to do to get into our first home in that price range.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655391">If we look at what youth are facing today, the unemployment rate for young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24 is 13.5%. The Canadian Income Survey outlines that in 2022, the average income for a Canadian worker was only $55,000. The average young Canadian today is facing a whole host of impediments to get to where they thought they would be in life today. That is one of the biggest issues facing our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655392">The NDP and the Liberals often say the Conservatives are going to cause extremism. No, it is the NDP-Liberal government that has taken away hope from an entire generation, who are going to push to the far left and the far right because of its disastrous policies and what it has done. I have lived under an NDP government in British Columbia for seven years and nine years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655393">Every night in Canada, there are about 25,000 to 35,000 Canadians who cannot afford a home or cannot access social housing. Unfortunately, that number is even higher for indigenous Canadians. About 30% of the Canadians who are homeless come from one of our first nations. That is not acceptable. About 22% of shelters are aimed at young homeless people in Canada, while 20% of the people experiencing homelessness are between the ages of 13 and 24.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655394"> Let us tie that to our unemployment rate. We have a hard scenario for young people in our country right now. I would be remiss if I did not outline that since the NDP-Liberal government came into power nine years ago, the budget at Indigenous Services Canada has increased 181%. I shared that with one of the chiefs in my riding recently and he said that if we took even a portion of that money and gave it directly to first nations to address childhood poverty and housing on reserve, we would be in a much better position than the increase of bureaucrats in Ottawa who are not accountable to the taxpayers of Canada and are not accountable to the indigenous people who rely on their services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655395">We could have done so much better to help indigenous people who face some of the biggest challenges for housing in this country, along with young Canadians. That brings me to the announcement that the hon. <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party has made and that is a simple tax cut that will save the average purchaser of a new home between $40,000 and $50,000. That is not an insignificant amount of money. It will make a big difference in the time it takes to save up for a mortgage and to, indeed, afford a mortgage if one is successful in purchasing a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655396">Of all the countries in the developed world, Canada has some of the highest occupancy rates. It is because we have not done enough to spur new homebuilding construction in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655397">In fact, TD Economics just came out with a report on productivity in September of this year. They said that the biggest impediment to Canada's economy is our ability to build homes and fill the jobs in building construction for new homes in Canada. That report also stated that we have to create incentives and maintain incentives that will push people back into the industry to meet the very real challenges we face, no matter what area of the country we are in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655398">Throughout this debate so far, Liberal and NDP members have been challenging Canadians on the money that was given to municipalities to speed up building permits. In fact, my community received $26.5 million under the accelerator fund, I believe it is called. Unfortunately, in that very time since they received $26 million, they put out a proposal to double the DCC and to levy a new tax on home builders of $7,500 per unit to fund our infrastructure deficit as it relates to parks and recreation. Young Canadians cannot afford those costs. The City of Abbotsford should not be putting its inability to approve new home builds onto the backs of young Canadians who are just trying to get by and have some hope of home ownership once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655399">There are so many big challenges facing our country but the number one thing that I hear at the doorsteps, which people in my riding want me working on, is to restore the dream of home ownership. The Conservative Party is on the right path. Our proposals relate to densification, to incentivizing construction, to building more homes that Canadians need and that they can afford.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655426">These troubling reports led to witnesses being called to committee. They came to tell us that, basically, the Liberal government's national housing strategy is not working. Over $80 billion has been invested in affordable housing, but we will not get anywhere as long as everything is determined solely on the principle of supply and demand. This is evident when we look at how the market works: When we act on the supply side, that reduces demand. This is partly true, but we must act on the real demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655427">In the current housing crisis, the real demand is for social housing, non-market housing. We must ensure that these housing units meet the affordability criteria, which means that people must not spend more than 30% of their income on housing.

              <ParaText id="8655434"> As I begin my comments today, I would like to recap some of the background, because a lot of Canadians may not be aware of just how horrible the SDTC scandal really is. SDTC started in 2001, and for years operated without any cloud of concern, but with the Liberal government in charge, it became a $400-million slush fund for Liberal elite insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655435">The Auditor General conducted an investigation and found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that could not demonstrate environmental benefit or the development of green technology. There was another $58 million to projects without ensuring that carbon contribution agreement terms were met. A whopping, staggering $334 million went to over 186 projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. Now, as I stand here, the former Liberal minister who was supposed to be overseeing this and making sure the SDTC ran properly is across the street denying any knowledge or awareness of the 186 projects with conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655436">The reason the public is able to know what went on is that a whistle-blower came forward from SDTC and testified that “the current government is more interested in protecting themselves and protecting the situation from being a public nightmare. They would rather protect wrongdoers and financial mismanagement than have to deal with a situation like [this]”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655437">Certainly, everything from the Liberal government since the whistle-blower's testimony seems to be backing up the assertion that there is a cover-up in place, that the Liberal government will go to any extent possible to avoid having a real, transparent conversation about the corruption that occurred at SDTC. Conservatives are asking for basic accountability and for documents to be released and turned over so the relevant law enforcement authorities can make their own decisions about what to do with all of the evidence. However, currently all of the evidence is being withheld because the Liberals refuse to comply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655438">A question that I think is natural to ask is this: What do my constituents think about this? Liberals have gone to great lengths to downplay the issue as if it were not a matter of broad public interest in our country. I have, thankfully, had the chance to speak with residents of Durham about the scandal. It is pretty clear why my constituents are upset, because $400 million is a lot of taxpayer money to waste, to dish out to Liberal elite insiders in a corruption scandal when there are very serious problems in this country that would benefit from taxpayers' keeping more of their money and not giving it to the Liberal Party so it can then send it out the window.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655439">Let us put into perspective what $400 million means in real economic terms for the average Canadian. First, if we do the math, 400 million bucks works out to about $9,700 per person in this country. That is an enormous amount of money for the average Canadian. It would make getting through life the rest of this year a lot easier. However, Canadians were not able to keep that tax money for themselves. No, they were overtaxed so Liberals could take their money and then give it out to their friends. It is no surprise that Canadians are frustrated and upset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655440"> What else could be done with $400 million? We are in the middle of a housing crisis in this country. I am a renter who dreams of owning a home one day. As a millennial, I am part of an entire generation of Canadians that is now looking at a housing market that looks increasingly unlikely for us to ever participate in.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655441">There was a time in this country when that could be taken for granted. People would do everything they are asked to do: finish school, work hard, get a job, pay their taxes. Then home ownership would be a realistic, attainable goal. That is not now the case. What would $400 million mean in those terms? In my community of Durham, $400 million could buy over 440 homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655442">That is again putting into perspective the value of the taxpayer dollars that the Liberals took from the public and dished out to their elite insider friends. In a housing crisis, that is completely inexcusable, yet a generation of Canadians continues to have a government turn its back on them at a time when home ownership is a distant dream for many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655443">What else could $400,000 do for the Canadian people? If Canadians were able to keep that money, based on the average amount of groceries that a family of four buys, according to “Canada's Food Price Report 2023”, $400 million is the equivalent of over 24,000 families buying groceries for a year. Again I will put this into perspective. Two million Canadians are lining up at food banks right now. People going to grocery stores are increasingly feeling the strain of not being able to purchase the things they used to be able to afford just a couple of years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655444">Every time I go to the grocery store, I notice people who put produce or meat into their cart and then second-guess whether they should put it back on the shelf, because they are not sure they can afford what they are used to feeding their family. At a time like this, $400 million of taxpayer money being wasted is infuriating because people are making real compromises on what they purchase from the grocery store every day. The money amounts to over 24,000 families' grocery bills for an entire year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655445">What else could be done with $400 million? Many people in this country are struggling right now with car ownership because the Liberal government is increasing a carbon tax that makes it harder to pay for fuel and to make use of a vehicle to go to work, go to school, get around and take kids to soccer practice, hockey practice, piano lessons or whatever. The cost of car ownership has gone up under the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655446">What could taxpayers do with a car if they could keep the $400 million? That is the equivalent of 24,000 Canadians being able to pay for gas, parking, insurance and car maintenance for an entire year. That is what $400 million would mean to taxpayers if they were allowed to keep that money; instead, it was taken from them to be dished out to Liberal elite insiders as part of a $400-million green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655447">What else could be done with $400 million? One of the things I hear a lot from moms and dads in my community is that there is an increasing number of kids who need more services and support. We have, Lord knows, in my province of Ontario, an epically failing Ministry of Education that puts an increasing number of children in a position where the day-to-day supports offered by schools just are not enough to help kids get over the adversity and challenges they are facing. I recently heard from a mom and dad who were concerned about not being able to afford speech therapy for their kids. The $400 million would provide one hour a week of speech therapy in an entire year in the greater Toronto area for over 48,000 children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655448"> When we put this in terms of what the money means for the average taxpayer, taking the money away from people has real consequences. When they hear what was being done with the money, it is no wonder they are frustrated by the current government and the status quo in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655449">The last one is an important one, and I say this as a cancer survivor and someone who has great admiration and appreciation for health care workers in this country. I say this because the government constantly points fingers, as if Liberals were the only people who care about health care in Canada. If they care so much about health care, where is their apology to the Canadian public for spending $400 million of taxpayer money on Liberal elite insiders, which would have been the equivalent of over 60,000 people being able to stay at a hospital?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655450">According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, $400 million would cover over 60,000 hospital stays in the health care system we have right now. The $400 million of taxpayer money being wasted is incredibly concerning for someone who looks at the numbers, knows all of these problems are stacking up across Canada and then hears what is being done with their tax money. Of course taxpayers are frustrated; that is just an inevitability. I am just putting what is a real Liberal scandal in clear economic terms.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655451"> I would like to touch on why some of the residents of my community of Durham are also frustrated with what is happening with respect to the SDTC scandal, which is that they are big believers in making real, genuine investments in technology. Many of my constituents in Durham either work at or have family members who work at the Darlington nuclear facility. It is an incredible facility in Durham region that powers our local economy and generates a tremendous amount of energy for our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655452">There have been tremendous technology investments at the Darlington nuclear facility, including medical isotopes, which are now used to help with cancer treatments. There is also the development of small modular nuclear reactors, which will make low-carbon-emitting energy more accessible to rural and remote communities. This technology is being exported across the world. These are incredible innovations and they are happening in my backyard in Durham.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655453"> My constituents know that technology investments are actually very important. The Liberal government claimed that was what was happening with the SDTC, that the $400 million was going to go to technology investments like the kinds of investments that we know could happen with that money in Durham. However, that is not what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655454">In fact, we have an industry that employs 89,000 Canadians and adds $17 billion to our GDP each year, but none of the $400 million was used to support our technology developments. None of it was used to support the nuclear industry. In fact, the money was dished out to Liberal elite insiders who, I recap, were engaged in over 186 conflicts of interest, with $58 million going to 10 ineligible projects that could not demonstrate environmental benefit or the development of green technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655455">I can assure members that the Darlington nuclear facility could have used some of that money to continue the great work that is being done there. It is developing green technology and does have very clear, measurable environmental benefits. Again, people in Durham understand that technology investments matter, but that is not what we are getting from the Liberal government. Instead we are getting a cover-up of a scheme that took the money away from projects that could have benefited from it and gave it to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655456">I would like to continue by also addressing some concerns related to the police. We have heard from Liberals ad nauseam over the last few weeks that they are somehow doing the will of the police by opposing a basic request for accountability. On that, I would like to say that I believe that this is part of a broader trend with the Liberal government of, frankly, not respecting or trusting police officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655457">Just recently, police associations across Canada, including the Toronto Police Association and the Vancouver Police Association, have come out and criticized the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal policies for increasing crime in our country. There has been a 116% increase in handgun crime under the current government. Police associations have rung the alarm and are openly asking the Liberal government to listen to what their members have to say. They are on the ground and are seeing the consequences of Liberal policies every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655458">What are they being told? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278652" Type="2">Pickering—Uxbridge</Affiliation> have stood here in the House of Commons and accuse the police associations of somehow mimicking talking points from gun lobbyists. It is absurd. It is disrespectful to law enforcement in this country; however, it is more than just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655459">The <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has before him, right now on his desk, a report that makes a series of recommendations about the criminal justice system. One of those recommendations is cutting police budgets. Yes, it is a recommendation that would take away 25% of the grant dollars from public safety, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General that police organizations are currently able to apply for. They would no longer be eligible for that money.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655460">If the Liberals were as supportive of the police as they claim to be, they would have just come out and said this recommendation is absurd, that they trust the police and that they think the police do a good job and are an important institution in our communities. The Liberals should have said they do not want to even entertain that recommendation, but that is not what we heard from the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. In fact, what we got from him is a celebration of that report. He called it “history-making” and “an important milestone”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655461">This recommendation is absurd at face value. The more we look at it, the more we cannot even believe the Liberals would celebrate these kinds of policies. However, what we are asking them to do is turn over documents to the police and trust them to make their own decision about what to do with them. That is what basic accountability means. That is all we are asking for. We are not directing the police on what to do. We trust their judgment to make a decision. The Liberals do not share that trust in law enforcement, and this goes to a long track record of anti-police bias.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655462">When we have a government that has this view of law enforcement, has an antagonistic relationship with police unions and has a <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> who is celebrating policy recommendations that will lead to the cutting of police budgets, it is no wonder the Liberals do not have the confidence to let the police decide. They should turn over the documents and let the police decide what they want to do with them. This is basic common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655463">I will return to what is happening across the street right now. Former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains, one of the people who were supposed to oversee SDTC and prevent a stacking up of conflicts of interest and the misallocation of funds, is continuing what we have been seeing for months and months, which is that the government does not want to answer questions, does not want to submit to any form of accountability and barely even wants to acknowledge there was wrongdoing. This has been a pattern that we continue to see, literally happening right now across the street, of thinking the Liberals can misuse $400 million of Canadian taxpayer funds and not even have to answer questions on a potential investigation. They vilify a whistle-blower who dares to speak up about what is going on, a whistle-blower who pointed out and called it right that the government would not want to hold itself accountable and would do everything it possibly could to downplay this and avoid answering any questions. For the Liberals, the PR side of this is a bigger problem than the taxpayer accountability side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655464"> This entire debate we are having right now about the $400-million Liberal green slush fund really comes back to taxpayer accountability. The government is not entitled to everyone's money, no matter how much it likes to raise taxes and oppose our attempts to lower taxes. The Liberals can play those games all they want, but the reality is they are not entitled to people's money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655465">They introduce policies, and policies should be based on some mechanism of trust with the taxpayer so that every time we pay taxes, that money is used for a good purpose that benefits our communities, our families and our country. However, what we are seeing is a betrayal of that trust at a time when we have very serious problems that deserve attention and that could be benefited by taxpayers' having more of their own money in their pockets. Instead, we are seeing people get overtaxed, and the spending that comes from that overtaxation is being done in a way that is entirely reckless. Now there is a chance to have some accountability in that process for the Liberals, but on this side of the street, they are trying to downplay the problem, holding Parliament up and refusing to release the documents, and on the other side of the street, they continue to not answer any questions we have at committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655484">When we look at hospital stays, car payments, groceries and homes, there are a whole host of things that have become very expensive for a lot of people and burdens on our public systems. People are frustrated by what that has done to our quality of life. Taxpayers have an expectation that when they see a deduction from their paycheques or an extra 13% added onto everything they buy, they are going to see some benefit from the money being taken away from them. When that money is being taken and misused, with Liberals dishing it out to elite Liberal insiders, like George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld trading a rye bread out the window, of course people are going to be frustrated. </ParaText>

I hope that, as the night goes on, something will come to mind. Before I get into my speech, I just wanted to highlight something very briefly, if the House will quickly allow. I had the immense privilege to go and visit, last weekend, an organization called Jack.org. It is Canada's only charity training that empowers young leaders to revolutionize mental health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655494">The work they are doing is incredibly moving, and I wish I had more time in the House to share some of the stories. Suicide among youth is still the leading health-related cause of death for young people in Canada. One in seven young people in Canada reports having suicidal thoughts, to say nothing of those who do not report. This year, 150,000 will act on their thoughts by attempting suicide. For hundreds of them, the attempt will be fatal. Things need to change, and Jack.org is doing a lot of that work for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655495"> Now to turn to the matter at hand, which is the privilege motion here before the House. I rise with great disappointment to speak to this question of privilege. This particular question of privilege is related to the failure to produce documents required by an order of the House. On June 10, a majority of members in the House passed a motion that ordered the production of important documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655496">The key word there is “order”. It was not “ask” or “request”; it was not that, in the opinion of the House, the board “should”. The House of Commons has the authority to order the production of documents. That authority comes right from the Constitution; in fact, it is in section 18 of the British North America Act, also known as the Constitution Act, 1867.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655497">It clearly states, “The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons, and by the members thereof respectively, shall be such as are from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada”. That power includes the time-honoured ability to send for persons, papers and records.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655503">Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC for short, is the organization we are focusing this privilege motion on once again today. It has become known here in the House as the green slush fund. Just to back up a bit, and for some historical context, the Office of the Auditor General made several key observations for the audit period of March 2017 to December 2023. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655504">I will read a few quotes from the report that was tabled in the House on June 4. First, “10 projects were awarded $59 million” in funding when they should have been deemed “ineligible”. I would suggest that is concerning. Second, SDTC's “conflict-of-interest policies were not followed” in “90 cases”. Again, this is very concerning.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655505">Third, “the board approved $58 million for projects without ensuring that they met the terms of the contribution agreements.” I would think that this is something the government would also be very concerned about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655506">Meanwhile, the responses to these issues appear to show the exact opposite. Of the responses I have seen to many Auditor General reports, I cannot recall such out-of-touch responses. In its written responses, SDTC made false and outright preposterous claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655507">First, SDTC claimed, “Each project proposal goes through rigorous due diligence and evaluation” that is “robust” and “highly credible”. That is simply not true, but if it were true, SDTC would not be facing this $58-million scandal, unless the due diligence it was referring to is actually just its insiders looking at who on the board would be getting money out of each proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655508">Second, SDTC claimed that it was subject to an Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada evaluation in 2018. That was six years ago and outside the period of the Auditor General's audit. Essentially, SDTC was clearly ignoring the audit period and ignoring these findings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655509">Third, SDTC claimed it “uses external experts”, but then failed to identify them. For an organization whose problem is conflicts of interest to claim things are going to be better based on the advice provided by some unnamed external experts shows just how out of touch SDTC had really become.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655510">Fourth, SDTC claimed that it did not fully agree to the Auditor General's recommendations because SDTC “has delivered strong outcomes against these objectives.” Unless those objectives were to push money into companies that board members had a financial interest in, that is simply not true. The Auditor General found that 82% of the funding transactions approved by the board of directors during the audit period were conflicted. That is unreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655511">Fifth, SDTC wrote, “written records did not fully capture the robust deliberations that were made” and “SDTC is of the view that these projects met the eligibility criteria set out...but acknowledges that the [Auditor General] reached a different conclusion”, suggesting that the independent Auditor General was basically out to get them. The arrogance is appalling. The operators of the green slush fund were simply saying that the Auditor General got it wrong, there was nothing to see here, we should ignore it and let them get back to business. Then, at the same time, they admitted that their own written records do not support their claim, so they stuck by their story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655512"> Sixth, SDTC claimed it “had clear processes for staff and directors to declare real, potential and perceived conflicts”. Again, this claim completely ignores the findings of the Auditor General and, subsequently, the public accounts committee. We know conflicts were not declared, and even when they were declared, they either voted for their own projects or took turns voting for each other's projects. The idea that there were clear processes for conflicts of interest would be laughable if it were not so sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655513">Seventh, SDTC claimed it “further strengthened its conflict-of-interest policies” in November 2023. This shows exactly that the SDTC only cared about preventing corruption after they got caught with corruption. By November 2023, they knew the Auditor General's report was coming because the audit period was from March 2017 to December 2023. Claiming that policies have been strengthened and implying nothing further needs to be done after corruption has already been uncovered is disingenuous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655514">There is a word that comes to mind: entitlement. This kind of entitlement comes from an organization that is so used to getting vast amounts of money for its own purposes, it disconnects from the realities of honest and hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655515">There is still a lot that we do not know about the green slush fund, but what we have learned through the industry committee and the public accounts committee is alarming. What we have learned so far has made those of us on the opposition benches determined to get the full story, and for that, we need these documents the House requested back on June 10th.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655516">We know that SDTC was created in 2001, and as of an audit in 2017, no problems had arisen. The conflict of interest culture only emerged after board members were appointed under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> by former minister Bains. The most concerning of these appointments was in 2019, when the chair, Annette Verschuren, was appointed despite multiple warnings of conflicts of interest. Those warnings turned out to be warranted as, this past July, the former chair was determined by the Ethics Commissioner to have violated the Conflict of Interest Act by participating in decisions to benefit organizations she had an interest in. One would suggest that they were warned but went ahead anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655517"> We now know that former assistant deputy minister Noseworthy was responsible for keeping watch over SDTC, but we can only call his job simply a failure. On December 11 of last year, he appeared at the industry committee and said, “To my knowledge, I am not aware of any decisions to allocate funds to projects related to board members where they did not recuse themselves.” However, the Auditor General's report released just two months later informed us that the system was filled with conflicts of interest. Again, the Auditor General is independent. Therefore, the assistant deputy minister either lied at committee or was willfully blind to the corruption that was going on around him. We also know that, if there were any semblance of good governance, the minister of innovation, science and industry would have been notified. However, because accountability is absent, we do not know what the minister knew or when he knew it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655518">Nevertheless, we do know that at least one Liberal MP was informed almost two years ago. When the whistle-blower known to the public accounts committee as Witness 1 appeared at public accounts last month, they informed the committee that they had informed the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278598" Type="2">Calgary Skyview</Affiliation> all the way back in May 2022. The whistle-blower further stated that this member “assured me that he took this situation seriously and guaranteed that he would facilitate contact with the appropriate people in the federal government and the Auditor General's office.” However, we now know that the member was not true to his word and subsequently refused to engage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655519">We know that the directors were appointed to the board. A key example of this was long-time Liberal operative Stephen Kukucha. He was appointed to the board in February 2021. This is after he had been a long-time donor, a ministerial staffer in the Chrétien government, original organizer for the Liberal Party and former general secretary for the Liberal Party 2016 Convention. Shortly after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came into office, this insider became a lobbyist; he advocated for energy and transportation businesses. It does not get more inside than this, yet he was appointed to the board of the green slush fund, exactly where companies that had a financial interest could receive contributions directly from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655520">Furthermore, in another twist, as my hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> has explained, we now know that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> has had an interest in a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital. Cycle Capital also received funding from the same green slush fund. It just keeps unravelling more and more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655521">Finally, we now know from a member of the new board that, since this scandal broke, none of the money that was wrongfully sent out has been recovered. On behalf of the Canadian taxpayer, I will say that this is unfair, unacceptable and, quite frankly, incredibly frustrating. Simply put, after all this, it seems rather clear and painfully obvious that we need the documents that were called for in the motion passed by a clear majority of members on June 10.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655522"> This is not only a matter of parliamentary privilege; it is also a matter of the moral obligation we have to Canadians. In order to meet that obligation, we need to access documents when we have ordered them from the executive branch. The public accounts committee is still waiting on documents it has requested to receive. We do not have the contribution and funding agreement showing the requirements and obligations of the recipients. We do not have the conflict of interest declarations of the board members, and we owe it to Canadians to produce this information. When we put all of this together, we do not have transparency, oversight or accountability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655523"> I started my speech indicating that I am disappointed to be rising in this debate in Parliament because it is not the first time we have seen this type of parliamentary privilege violated. Earlier this year, there was yet another privilege debate on yet another scandal, the one related to ArriveCAN. The slow erosion of rights and privileges is not a small matter. It is an absolute threat to our democracy. We saw this in the previous Parliament with the Winnipeg lab scandal, and it caused tremendous hardship for the scandal-plagued government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655524">On that occasion, in the 43rd Parliament, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada was even called to the bar of this House of Commons to be admonished for failing, or, perhaps more accurately, refusing, to provide documents that he had been ordered to provide to the House. One would have hoped the government had learned from that experience, but clearly, it did not, and here we are again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655525">In June 2021, 147 members on that side of the House, shamefully, voted against the motion on the question of privilege, which has proven to be a huge mistake. I should hope, this time around, history does not repeat itself and they do not repeat that mistake. However, now we have this green slush fund scandal. The government continues to refuse to release documents that it has been ordered to produce because, one can only presume, it does not want to help uncover corruption that has occurred under its watch for the past several years, corruption that has benefited its own insiders. It is an issue of vital importance. No matter how hard the government tries to push it away, Parliament must continue to pursue it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655526">When the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> raised the initial question of privilege, he referenced a memorandum he had obtained from the Privy Council Office at the beginning of this Parliament. That memorandum read, “Public servants do not share in ministers' constitutional accountability to the Houses of Parliament but support ministers in this accountability”; it also stated that “the ultimate accountability for deciding what information to withhold from or release to parliamentarians resides with the responsible minister.” The government may believe the rights and privileges of Parliament no longer matter, but we will soon see if it believes the ministerial responsibility still matters. It is the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> who is ultimately responsible for SDTC and for this violation of an order of the House. It is the minister who must be held accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655527">In conclusion, I support the motion as moved by the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation>, and I will reference it here. The motion by the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle on the alleged failure to produce documents pertaining to Sustainable Development Technology Canada reads as follows: “That the government's failure of fully providing documents, as ordered by the House on June 10, 2024, be hereby referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655543">That aside, there is another issue I have raised on numerous occasions, yet no one in the Conservative Party has been able to provide an explanation. Canadians have a right to know why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation> will not get the security clearance. Is there something in the background of the leader, something he is scared to tell Canadians about his past? Is it because the leadership convention that he won was influenced by foreign interference? Is it because members of his caucus are affiliated with it? What is it? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655576">A couple of years ago, when I was on the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, we tabled this great report on facial recognition technology and the growing power of artificial intelligence. The concurrence motion on this was brought forward a couple of weeks ago by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, and she articulated very well why we needed to do the study in the first place because of the problems that we have in Canada with the unregulated use of facial recognition technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655577">We have a situation where policy has lagged behind and technology is moving at lightning speed. The government's answer to this is Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which is a broken piece of legislation, which has already been admitted by the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Ministry of Industry</Affiliation>. The minister has said that we need to improve upon it through amendments at committee, but when it is this broken, in three parts, it really makes it more difficult to modify and manage. We need to go back to the drawing board. I just want to point out some of the problems that we studied at committee. We heard about how Tim Hortons' app, for example, was actually tracking the movement of customers who were using the Tim Hortons app to buy their food and then tracking their movements for the first 10 minutes after they left a Tim Hortons store. Tim Hortons then sold that information to other stores so that they could harvest that data and then determine how best to access those customers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655578">It was a complete violation of privacy but an ingenious way of making use of an app and GPS, and using that technology to be able to track people. If Tim Hortons could do that, imagine what nefarious actors could do here in Canada or around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655579">We also heard, from a security perspective, how the RCMP and other police agencies across this country made use of facial recognition technology that came out of the Clearview AI database. The disturbing part of Clearview AI is that it scraped all of its images from social media to train its artificial intelligence. It accessed Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. When the company then programmed it, whether knowingly or unknowingly, it created a racial algorithm that was biased, especially with regard to men of darker complexions. Whether they were Middle Eastern, whether they were African, Black or brown, they were definitely discriminated against in the technology. They were wrongfully accused through facial recognition that was being used en masse by the RCMP and other police agencies here in Canada as well as in the United States, causing discrimination in arrests that were ultimately wrong at the end of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655580">The same was happening with our indigenous Canadians, who were also being wrongfully accused through the use of Clearview AI technology by the RCMP. We also had TELUS providing data and giving locations of people, for tracking, for things like COVID, to the Public Health Agency of Canada, again, a complete violation of the privacy rights of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655581">We cannot forget how we had, of course, the trucker convoy up here and we had the public doxxing of those that were part of the trucker convoy. They were located using GPS and then someone was able to go into the system and map them out on Google Maps and publicly disclose their banking information as well as their home addresses, a complete violation of Canadian privacy. We dug in on this when we were part of the committee on ethics and privacy and protection of information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655582">We want to make sure that individuals are aware of it. Public education needs to keep up. At the end of the day, we need to make sure that there is the right to know that our data has been collected through facial recognition, with all of the cameras that we have around here on the Hill, never mind what is happening in other public spaces, like airports, train stations and stores. There needs to be a public disclosure of that, so that people know, when they are entering, that there is proper signage. We get into all of this in the recommendations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655583">People have the right to have that information disposed of, including images that may be left up on social media platforms and images that have been collected by government agencies and corporations. Employees are exposed to this at work, because there are cameras all over the place monitoring. When they leave that platform or they leave that employment, or they are no longer, supposedly, on a watch-list, their data should be disposed of. That right to disposal is paramount.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655584"> Of course the government's answer to this was Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. It did answer the report, too. If I have time, I will get into their response to the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655585"> I should just point out that as Conservatives, we believe that digital data privacy is a fundamental right of all Canadians. It urgently requires us to have the legislation, protections and enforcement to guarantee the privacy of all Canadians. We also believe that Canada's digital policy framework is in dire need of modernization. It is outdated, it is stale and the technology is moving much too fast. We are lagging behind our international counterparts. When we were at the committee, we heard about best practices, particularly from the European Union, and how we need to institute some of their ideas and their policies so that we can have the flexibility to adjust to data as it is being modernized and the technology is advancing, but also to ensure that Canada's privacy protections are in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655586">Now, as I mentioned, we have serious concerns about Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> and so we are going to be looking at ways to redraft that bill, making sure that we bring forward the proper legislation, not burdensome red tape on small businesses, Canadians and sole proprietors. We are going to put forward a lot of common-sense amendments, as Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> is currently being studied by the industry committee, I believe. There needs to be lots of consultation and input from stakeholders, Canadians, security agencies and the government on what is needed and what plans there are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655587">Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> is an omnibus bill. It has three chunks of legislation in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655588"> Some of the key problems in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> have to do with part 1, which deals with the consumer privacy protection act. We believe that it is the right of businesses to collect and use some personal information, but we also want to bring home greater privacy protections for individuals and charities, and bring clarity for organizations, which is right now missing in that part of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655589">Then the government also set up, in part 2, the personal information and data protection tribunal act. Putting in place a privacy tribunal appointed by the government to put Liberals in place to oversee the privacy protection of Canadians is a concern. As we have been debating here, the Liberals who were appointed to the green slush fund, SDTC, ultimately ended in corruption. We want to make sure that we do not have another layer of bureaucracy. We do not need to overburden this and slow down the prosecutions for those who misuse and violate the privacy laws of Canada. We need to work more closely with the Privacy Commissioner and advocate for the removal of this tribunal. As the Privacy Commissioner has also said, it is completely unnecessary. We want to have quicker prosecutions and quicker turnarounds, and remove the gatekeepers that the government is proposing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655590">Then the final part of this bill is part 3, dealing with the artificial intelligence and data act, which I can tell colleagues right now is outdated and broken even though it is not even legislation yet. It was introduced in June 2022 and things have moved so quickly with things like ChatGPT, new generative AI systems and new facial recognition systems that the act that is prescribed in there does not work. We are concerned about giving too much regulatory power to the government on a legislative and policy framework that is already outdated when Canadians need protection today on the technology of tomorrow.</ParaText>

Having regulations in place and having legislation in place is important. In fact, the first time I witnessed the Conservatives actually using AI was when they wanted to amend a piece of legislation. I think, by using AI, they came up with 20,000 amendments in committee, which was a record in itself. So, we do know that the research bureau of the Conservative Party does use AI.</ParaText>

For example, the Liberals have failed to properly prosecute generators of intimate images. Instead of protecting our youth, the Liberals want to make everybody a criminal, or they want to censor the entire Internet. That is why Canadians do not trust the Liberals. Therefore I will continue to advocate for stronger legislation and policy that actually protect Canadians' privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655594"> I know that, as Conservatives, we will bring forward the legislation that would protect our youth and allow the freedom for people to move without being tracked. It would allow people to be anonymous on the Internet when they want to be, rather than having overarching red tape, censorship and unnecessary tracking as we witnessed during the COVID pandemic under the arrive scam app and as we saw with the Public Health Agency of Canada. All of that continues to undermine Canadians' confidence in the current Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655604"> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for giving a great speech. It seems like nine years ago that we sat on the ethics committee, but I think it was only three years ago. We use the number nine a lot in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655605">Today, I want to speak about why nations fail. To quote Acemoglu and Robinson, “Nations fail today because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate.” As a whole, that also includes privacy: the right of businesses to operate and the freedom of citizens to operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655606">We can go all the way back to something I am very fascinated with. North America and South America were founded around the same time, but how did North America end up becoming so rich and wealthy and South America did not? It comes down to those same pillars. We allowed freedom to operate. We allowed freedom for patents to be developed, especially in the Industrial Revolution. We allowed people the freedom to have their own land, to have privacy on their own land and to own businesses with patents, allowing privacy for those businesses to operate, to get investments and capital and to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655607">What we saw from that was a tremendous amount of wealth, more wealth than the world had ever seen. It formed a capitalist society that allowed wealth to be owned by individuals. People who used to be poor became wealthy, and that allowed a nation like Canada to have socialist capitalism. With this tremendous amount of wealth, there was the ability to have socialist programs like a universal health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655608">When we do not follow the narrow corridor, and it is a very narrow corridor, not only with liberty but also with capitalism and socialism, and we stick with the fundamentals of privacy, investment, free capital and patents, we lose the wealth of the nation. With that, the citizens suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655609">After nine years, we are seeing that reality here in Canada. We have the worst housing crisis this country has ever faced. Rents have doubled. Mortgage payments have doubled. The amount needed for a down payment has doubled. Nine million Canadians are now food insecure. That is one-third of Canadians, and that number in the U.S. is barely 13%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655610">We see the problem with businesses fleeing this country. We talk a lot about what that means for AI and having great ideas. We also talk about IP, the currency of innovation. When we look at what happens in Canada, the numbers are startling. Canada files 40,000 patents annually compared to the 374,000 the U.S. files, and only 13 out of 100 patents are owned by Canadians. That means we give away over 87% of our patents to foreign nations; we give that data away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655611">When we look at what that means for the Americans, we see they generate 12 million jobs and $2 trillion from patents and IP. Of course, AI is among that. In Canada, that number is less. The best way to look at it is by using GDP per capita or income per capita. The GDP per capita for Canada is $53,000, compared to $80,000 for the U.S., more than a 36% difference. We have seen less capital and less ability to invest, save and innovate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655612">We can couple that with the problems with the business investment and productivity we have seen in Canada and the lack of privacy. Of course, the government has tried, but as with a lot of things, it has tried and failed. It presented Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document> before the last Parliament and could not get it through. In this Parliament, it submitted Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, and at the last minute, it threw AI legislation in it called the AIDA. What happened at committee? I know the Conservatives get blamed for this, but at committee, the Conservatives, the Bloc and the NDP all came together to say this bill was terrible in the way it was presented. Even the Liberals were filibustering it in committee at one point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655613">We need these bills to work. The Conservatives have been steadfast that privacy is a fundamental human right, and not only privacy for individuals in Canada but privacy for our children. We know the results of not having the right legislation come forward and not having privacy protection in Canada. We saw it at the ethics committee two years ago when we faced the daunting speculation of privacy in facial recognition technology.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655614">This technology was misused. A company called Clearview AI scraped images off the Internet, and we know how many images are on the Internet. It scraped everyone's face off the Internet and sold those images, which should not be owned by anyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655615">Privacy is a fundamental right. However, the thing we have come to also understand about AI, which was discussed at committee but was not in the legislation, is that it should never be able to use someone's face or likeness without their permission. Those are the biggest problems we are having. The biggest thumbprint we have, the most unique thing about us, is our face. Our colleague from the NDP brought this up, but the main point that came up at committee about facial recognition technology was this: When this technology was used by the RCMP and our police forces in Canada in terms of marginalized and minority groups in Canada, Black women and Black men, the technology misread their face and misidentified them 30% of the time. That is terrible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655616">Technology is supposed to make things better, and we could not believe what we were hearing. Police representatives were at this committee multiple times and testified that it misidentified these groups 30% of the time. That is a failure; it is ridiculous. This is something that should not be used. We went through all the reports on ethics and brought the final report to Parliament two years ago, in October 2022, with the recommendation to outlaw this technology until it gets better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655617">Here we are today, two years later, and this technology has not been outlawed. It has been in place for two years since the ethics committee found that there were these breaches. It is terrible that these breaches have been happening for so long. Today, as we stand in Parliament, facial recognition technology, which we call digital racism, is still allowed to be used in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655618">Again, it follows the bigger problems we have with the government, and not only with the recommendations that come from committee. The government always talks about filibustering. These are recommendations in a report that could have been done without Parliament's consent, because it was enacted by Parliament and came to the House to begin with. Here we are two years later, and that has not happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655619">Let us talk about all the other things that have not happened either. With respect to privacy, Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> is still in committee based on, again, the fact that the Liberals are filibustering their own bill. It is just terrible and needs to be redone. I think we all agree on the first part of PIPEDA and how that is going to be done. The Liberals do not, but we agree that the tribunal should be eliminated and that more power should go to the Privacy Commissioner. Again, those privacy breaches and the rights should be governed by the Privacy Commissioner as a whole. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655620">We looked at the proposed AIDA as a whole. AIDA was riddled with delays and inefficient guidance. It failed to provide the necessary oversight, allowing technologies such as facial recognition to remain largely unregulated. It was supposed to be prioritized legislation, yet it was wrong. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> brought the legislation to the committee, and three months later, he brought 60 different amendments to his own bill. We had never even heard of that before, and it certainly was not a good bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655621">I want to talk briefly about what is happening because we do not get privacy investment right in Canada. This is going to have long-term impacts. The capital gains tax hike is expected to reduce Canada's capital stock by $127 billion, resulting in 414,000 fewer jobs and a $90-billion drop in GDP. We cannot afford to lose control of our most valuable ideas or allow unchecked technologies to undermine our freedoms. Nations fail today because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, to invest and to innovate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655622">The consequences are already visible. Nine million Canadians are food insecure. Two million Canadians are visiting food banks, and this rate is 36% higher than that in the United States. It is time to reverse course. Let us regain control over our privacy. Let us make sure we give those fundamentals back to save, innovate and invest back into Canadian businesses. Let us bring home capitalism once again, where people can make a good wage, have a good job and bring home savings for them and their families. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655639">It is important we study this technology cautiously, as there are many benefits that will come from this type of innovation, but we must make sure this technology is used in a responsible way that protects the rights of all Canadians and, I would add, especially children. Throughout my time as a member of the industry committee, I have championed the inclusion of the best interests of the child in amendments to legislation of the Digital Charter Implementation Act, Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which includes the government's proposed legislation on artificial intelligence, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655640">Nowhere in this bill was the term “minor” defined. The Liberals rushed to get this bill to committee and failed to include separate protections for children's privacy that would have demonstrated their commitment to putting children first. We all know stories about the damages social media platforms and AI have already done to our children and youth. Conservatives will fight for stronger privacy protection for children and find a balance to still be innovative with this technology, so it is used appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655641">In addition to inserting the best interests of the child, Conservatives have also pushed to insert a children's code into Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, modelled after the U.K. Children's code. This amendment would empower the Governor in Council to introduce a code of practice for organizations, including businesses, to follow through regulation for online services related to children's online activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655642">The U.K. Children's code has become an international standard for jurisdictions around the world in creating legislation, yet the Liberals failed to include it when drafting legislation that pertains to children's privacy. Many stakeholders and witnesses emphasized the need for a children's code to be included in the bill, but the government did not meet with any of these stakeholders before tabling it. Children must be put first when it comes to creating legislation around facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655643">This was outlined by the report tabled by the ethics committee, with the Human Rights Commission, indicating that the legal framework for police use of facial recognition technology should take a human rights-based approach that integrates protection for children and youth. This has indeed come up in respect to the recommendation in the report, and I would note it is actually the Conservatives fighting against the New Democrats and the Liberals to enshrine these very important rights for the protection of children to uphold their right to privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655644">These types of amendments to bills demand a holistic approach to a child's development, ensuring their rights cannot be overridden by the commercial interests of a company, especially. However, the potential benefits of facial recognition technology and AI are substantial. The report outlined that these technologies can assist law enforcement in locating missing children and combatting serious crimes. As Daniel Therrien, former privacy commissioner of Canada, pointed out, facial recognition technology can serve “compelling state purposes”, including safeguarding our communities and ensuring public safety. It can also be a powerful tool in urgent situations, identifying individuals who pose threats or finding those who are lost or in danger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655645">However, these advantages must be weighed against the significant risks that cannot be overlooked. The same technologies that can find missing children also risk infringing upon their privacy and civil liberties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655646">Kristen Thomasen, law professor at the University of British Columbia, noted, while facial recognition technology can be touted as a protective measure for marginalized groups, “the erosion of privacy as a social good” ultimately harms everyone, especially “women and children”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655647">As we enhance surveillance capabilities, we risk consolidating an environment of constant observation that stifles individual freedoms. Moreover, as we consider the integration of AI into the lives of children, we must recognize the profound potential for manipulation and deception.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8655648">By their very nature, children are often at a distinct disadvantage when navigating AI systems. Their cognitive and emotional development leaves them particularly vulnerable to influences that they might not fully understand. AI tools, including AI companions, smart toys and even educational applications, can unwittingly lead children to disclose sensitive or personal information. Such disclosures can expose them to risks of exploitation, harm and even predatory behaviours by adults. Children may not grasp the implication of sharing personal information, and AI systems designed to learn from interactions can inadvertently manipulate their responses or choices, leading to harmful outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655649"> For example, a recent tragedy just came out of the U.S. in which a 14-year-old boy, Sewell Setzer, committed suicide after speaking with a chatbot on Character.AI. His mother is now suing the company. She wrote that AI can “trick customers into handing over their most private thoughts and feelings.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655650">The implications of deepfake technology further amplify these concerns. Deepfakes are highly convincing but entirely fabricated images or videos, placing children in situations they never experienced. Such manipulations can depict minors in inappropriate contexts or lead to false narratives that can damage their reputation and emotional well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655651">As technology becomes more accessible, children may find themselves targeted by malicious actors who use these tools to exploit their innocence. To combat these dangers, it is crucial that we act swiftly and decisively to develop comprehensive policies and laws that prioritize the protection of children over commercial interests while still fostering an environment where innovation can take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655652"> A legislative framework should clearly delineate the appropriate contexts in which facial recognition technology and AI can be employed for legitimate purposes while firmly prohibiting any uses that could infringe upon the rights of children and other vulnerable populations. This is why I want to re-emphasize the importance of including a children's code when regulating facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655653">In industry meeting 99 on November 28, 2023, Elizabeth Denham, chief strategy officer of the Information Accountability Foundation, came to input her opinions on Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. While working for five years as the U.K. Information Commissioner, she oversaw the creation of the U.K. Children's Code, and the design of that code has influenced laws and guidance all around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655654">The code assists organizations in creating digital services that cater, first and foremost, to children's needs. It is also important to note that, when we discuss a children's code, we should take into account the fact that children are biologically and psychologically different and distinct from adults.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655655"> Protecting children in the digital world means allowing them to be children in that world, with appropriate protections for their safety and their reputations, both today and tomorrow, when they enter adulthood. Numerous stakeholder groups, such as the Centre for Digital Rights, and witnesses, such as the former U.K. privacy commissioner, have advocated for a comprehensive code of practice to be created when it comes to regulations and laws related to children's privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655656">More specifically, a children's code would be developed through a consultation process that, at minimum, included the Privacy Commissioner, parental rights groups and children. It would be developed with the best interests of the children over commercial interests in the same space. A children's code would ensure that the following standards must be included when it is developed: data protection impact assessments, transparency, the detrimental use of data, default settings, data minimization, data sharing, geolocation, parental controls, profiling, nudge techniques, connected toys and other devices, and online tools, to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655657"> In conclusion, as we embrace the transformative potential of facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence, we must remain vigilant in prioritizing our children's best interests. The balance between harnessing innovation and safeguarding rights is delicate, but it is a responsibility we cannot afford to neglect. Here on the Conservative side, as these bills come before parliamentary committees, first and foremost, we want to see children go above commercial interests in all cases.</ParaText>

If, indeed, the member was so concerned about the passage of Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> through the House of Commons, the government would do what Canadians want and hand over the documents pertaining to the green slush fund from the former Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>

This was done because they were worried about the amendments that all the other parties of the House of Commons deemed appropriate, but that were not deemed appropriate by the minister and the backroom lobbyists who are informing his position.</ParaText>

I am going to try a third time to get an answer from Conservatives, though, about the important issue around facial recognition technology and the fact that we are now aware of the discrimination that can take place through the use of this technology. The report of the committee itself states very clearly that in the case, particularly, of racialized women, we are talking about an error rate of up to a third, which has profound implications for individuals who are caught by this weakness in the technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655690">Madam Speaker, the government's reckless spending and mismanagement of the national economy are causing inflation. Now, on top of that, it wants to tax this inflation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655691">This is how it works. Somebody buys a capital property, say, a commercial warehouse for their business, and over time, the value goes up. When they sell that property, that capital asset, there is a tax to pay on that capital gain, and so it is really a tax on inflation. It has always been deemed to be unfair, but Canada made the compromise by saying, “Well, we will put only half that capital gain into a person's income and then tax it at their marginal tax rate.” Is it fair? No, but it has been accepted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655692">The current government, on account of its incompetence, does not even know how to balance the budget in good times, in times of full employment, as in the first four years of the Liberals' administration, from 2015 to 2019. The economy was good, there were good government revenues and low interest rates, but even then, it could not balance the budget. The Liberals were lulled into a sense of complacency because of low interest rates, and it was spending till the cows came home. Well, eventually the cows did come home, in March 2020 with the pandemic, and all hell broke loose. There was deficit spending, borrowing, quantitative easing like we have never seen before in Canadian history and, very predictably, inflation followed. There were too many dollars chasing too few goods and services. The law of supply and demand, like the law of gravity, never changes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655693">The middle class, whom this government had promised to help, has suffered on account of this inflation. We can look at the cost of housing, groceries and transportation. What does the socialist government do? It attacks the wealthy, of course, which is what the Liberals always like to do. The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> introduced a capital gains tax increase, said the Liberals were asking the wealthiest 0.13% to pay just a bit more. Now many Canadians are finding out, to their surprise, that they are part of this elite group of Canada's wealthiest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655694"> Hard-working Karen in my riding runs her retail store very successfully. She bought her own commercial strata unit to save for her retirement. If she sells it for half a million dollars more than she bought it for, and in these inflationary times that is completely realistic, with the new rules, the capital gains inclusion rules, her tax bill will be $40,000 higher than it would have been under the old rules in Canada for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655695"> Will the Liberals keep their promise, keep the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s promise, that only the top 0.13% of income earners will be taxed, and will they leave ordinary, hard-working entrepreneurs like Karen alone? </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8655696">Madam Speaker, to start, before I expand on it, I will make very clear that as of June 25, 2024, the capital gains inclusion rate increased from one-half to two-thirds on capital gains realized annually above $250,000 by individuals and on capital gains realized by corporations and most types of trusts. We are talking about a quarter of a million dollars annually. It does not surprise me that the Conservative Party does not recognize the value of that and does not expect a bit more from those who have that sort of profit, but it is not appropriate to say it is not fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655697">When the Liberals came back in 2015, we put a special tax on the wealthiest 1% in Canada, and the Conservatives opposed that. At the end of the day, we have supported Canada's middle class in a very tangible and real way. I would go back to the time we decreased taxes for Canada's middle class. Again, the Conservatives voted against that. We brought in programs to support Canada's middle class and those aspiring to become a part of it, and we have looked at ways we can support others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655698">The member makes reference to inflation, but Canada, in comparison to virtually every other industrialized country, has done exceptionally well there. It does not mean that we sit back. We have not done that. We have recognized that we need to support Canadians, even though our economy, in many ways, is doing better than those of other countries around the world. We have done that through things such as the grocery rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655699">Members of the Conservative caucus often reference seniors. We have supported seniors in very tangible ways, whether with the substantial increase to the GIS a number of years ago or with an increase for those 75 and over. In many ways, the government has been there to support Canadians, and we will continue to look for ways to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655700">With a bigger, holistic approach when dealing with the economy, we have now seen interest rates drop in Canada, the first of the G7 countries. Inflation rates are now under control. I suggest the member take a look at the world environment, whether during the economic slowdown or the pandemic. No country was exempt from them. We all had to play a role. The Government of Canada, working with Canadians and other jurisdictions, like the provinces, the territories and indigenous leaders, has been able to minimize the negative impacts of what has been happening around the world. Yes, there are some areas where we need to increase revenue, but this is a fair way of doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655701">The Liberals obviously disagree with the Conservatives, but when we first came out with the announcement, the Conservatives sat on their hands and said nothing. It took them a while to decide on the position they were going to take. As it took them a while to adopt their position, I suggest they go back to the drawing board on it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655703">First, the parliamentary secretary said that a capital gain is a profit. It is not really a profit; it is inflation. Profit is when someone works hard and earns an income based on what they are selling. This is just inflation. If a person had to buy another asset, it would cost that much more, so it is not profit at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655704">Second, he said that compared to other countries, Canada is doing pretty good. Our real estate inflation is way worse than it is in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655705">Third, our GDP per capita, which is the most reliable measure of national wealth, lags substantially behind that of the United States. One of the reasons is that we are sending investment dollars to the U.S. instead of keeping them here in Canada. Increasing the capital gains tax does not help that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655706"> Madam Speaker, I have a couple of very quick facts. Only 0.13% of Canadians with an average income of $1.42 million are expected to pay more tax on their capital gains in any given year. Also, the current 50% inclusion rate can lead to unfair circumstances, where a millionaire can pay a lower marginal rate on capital gains than a nurse pays on salary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655707">People need to reflect on that. If my memory serves me correctly, Brian Mulroney had a higher percentage than what we are proposing. The member might want to fact-check that. I am relying purely on my memory.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8655708">Madam Speaker, I rise today to address a question. On September 9 of this year, before Parliament came back in session, the Liberal Party of Canada, not the Government of Canada, asked Mark “carbon tax” Carney to join the Liberals as a special economic adviser to advise on the economics of the country. Again, this is not the Government of Canada, but the Liberal Party of Canada, and that is to avoid the conflict of interest rules that are incumbent upon officers that serve the government. He is a special adviser for a special new task force on economic growth, a task force of one person. He is doing this himself. He is not talking to anybody else. My colleagues have called for an examination of this and for the lobbying commissioner to look into whether this is a conflict of interest and how it should be properly dealt with in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655709">Who is Mark “carbon tax” Carney? Well, amongst other roles in which he serves a lot of rich people around the world, he is the chairman of Brookfield Asset Management here in Canada. Brookfield is a very large corporation. It invests in all kinds of credit and equity around the world, and it has assets under management of $1 trillion U.S., so it is a significant fund. That is a little less than half of Canada's GDP in one fund, which Mark Carney helps oversee. I do not begrudge the fact that he has done well heading up a corporation like that. He has never actually worked there, but being a chairman, he is rewarded. How does Mark Carney get rewarded? He gets rewarded with deferred stock units and other options to participate in the financial success of Brookfield Asset Management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655710">Now, let us say there are $1 trillion of assets under management. Usually, these types of funds get paid as a percentage of the assets they hold under management. It can be as high as 2%, but let us say it is 1%. That is $10 billion a year in compensation that goes towards the managers of Brookfield Asset Management. I can be corrected on that number at some point in time, if someone would like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655711">On September 17, Brookfield proposed to lead a new $50-billion fund focused on Canadian assets, leading with $10 billion, not from a pension fund, but from the Government of Canada. This is not the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, but the Government of Canada. This is $10 billion from a broke government that actually does not have any money, but is $50 billion more in deficit this year, plus another $40 billion that it is proposing from pension funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655712"> Where is it getting that notion? It is getting that notion because back in the spring, in April, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> had a different former Bank of Canada governor look into how we need to address the productivity crisis that is happening in Canada and find out why pensions are not investing in Canadian business. That is because, quite frankly, it is a broken financial system under the government. It has broken the regulatory environment. CPPIB, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, in fact only has 12% of its assets invested in Canada. The rest is offshore. It does not invest in Canada. Investment funds are now flowing outside this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655713">Let us look at that conflict of interest. After we have been debating in the House of Commons for how many weeks the conflicts of interest involved in SDTC, how can the Liberals continue on this path to have another Liberal insider try to take some more funds from Canadians and not face the conflict of interest regulations?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655714">You are protecting your friends. Have you learned nothing? Will you actually accept that this should be a conflict of interest?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655717"> Madam Speaker, I am going to get to the question right away, but first I want to wish people a happy Diwali. Diwali is celebrated in every region of the country. It is a part of our Canadian heritage. It is about good over evil, light over darkness, knowledge versus ignorance. I think Canadians, whatever their background, should get out there and celebrate Diwali.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655718">Having said that, I appreciate the member's comments. Obviously, I do not agree with the member's comments, because what he has been tasked with doing is what I classify as a character assassination, where a Conservative member goes out of their way to take down an individual. Often we see it of ministers. Now we even see it of potential future politicians. Mark Carney has, in fact, contributed as a public servant in many ways, not only here in Canada but also in the U.K. As governor of the Bank of Canada, he was at the forefront of public policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655719">I find it very disturbing when Conservatives are so focused on tearing people down without legitimate justification. The equivalent would be my taking four minutes to be critical of Jenni Byrne, for example. Jenni Byrne is very cozy with the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative caucus. She is a lobbyist. One of the firms her company lobbies for is Loblaw. Canadians are concerned about food inflation and that Loblaw might have been gouging consumers, yet that individual is in the inner circle of the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. I would suggest she is probably closer to the leader, in different ways, than most Conservative members of Parliament. She carries a great deal of influence. As I said, I do not want to spend my full four minutes talking about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655720">Rather, I want to talk about some things we have witnessed over the last number of years, as there have been challenges in the economy. We look to individuals like Tiff Macklem, the current Governor of the Bank of Canada, the same governor the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> says we should be firing and the same governor who dismisses him completely. Because of that leadership and the administration of public policy, from Ottawa and other jurisdictions, today we have an inflation rate of less than 2%. We are on target. Interest rates are going down. I realize that goes against what the Conservatives want to do, which is to assassinate characters. Mr. Macklem is probably one of those individuals. At one point, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> was critical of him. He has backed off a bit, to his credit.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8655729">Madam Speaker, earlier this year, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed Mr. Carney to be his senior economic adviser, and in that role, Mr. Carney would have unfettered access, in theory, to confidential and sensitive economic information, and he would also have unfettered access to people who make policy decisions on economic policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655730"> The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has on multiple occasions said that Mr. Carney is a very close friend of hers. In fact he is one of her children's godparents. I do not believe she has disclosed him as a close friend, which is all fine in theory, except for the fact that Mr. Carney has, as my colleague has said, multiple business interests that relate to the types of policies that the finance minister or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would be implementing. Now, in his new role, he is ostensibly going to be implementing or suggesting policy himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655731">Therefore, clearly this is a matter for the lobbyist commissioner to look at, and I want to say why. First of all, example one is a fact: Right after Mr. Carney was appointed in the role, The Logic reported that Brookfield, the company that he chairs, had started talks with the federal government and the Canada Pension Plan fund to back a new multi-billion dollar fund that Brookfield is raising, and that Brookfield was seeking 10 billion tax dollars from the federal government for the fund. Mr. Carney is the chair of the board. Now he is sitting with power and access to be able to determine the federal budget and economic policy, and his company is asking for $10 billion. That is problem one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655732"> Problem two is that Mr. Carney also sits on the board of Stripe, a payment service. The federal government just struck a deal with Visa and Mastercard to lower payment processing fees, but Mr. Carney's company, Stripe, has elected not to pass that savings along to small businesses, but hoard it for itself. This begs the question of why the federal government did not require Stripe to do this, as would be done in other jurisdictions. Mr. Carney is on the board. He has access to this exact policy. His purview and his access to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> would give him purview to the policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655733">Example number three is a very close relationship with the Telesat CEO, Dan Goldberg. Telesat was just given $6 billion by the federal government, shortly after Mr. Carney's appointment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655734">As another example, overseas there is actually a company admitting that Mr. Carney lobbies the government for the company's joint business ventures on behalf of Brookfield. The company is HomeServe. The CEO, Richard Harpin, in the Telegraph is reported as saying, “Mark is working on our behalf in Government and he did have a meeting on this with Rachel Reeves”, a U.K. senior economic policy person. “It was covering some other issues and the role of Brookfield as a trillion-dollar investor in the U.K. And so it wasn't just this issue,” the subsidies it was looking for, “but he did mention it.” Mr. Harpin also said, “We want to make sure that there's some money allocated to this [from the federal government], that we've got a clear direction of travel when the Budget comes out on Oct 30.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655735">Here is the point: There is a man who is beholden to multiple corporations who is now directly advising the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214296 " Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the entire governing party on economic policy, and that is wrong. It is not character assassination to say it is wrong. It is fundamentally wrong. I would say it is a character flaw of the man to not see that. I am sure he believes that is altruistic, but it is not—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655737">Yes, Madam Speaker, it is a continuation. I will give an example to the member opposite. Let us imagine what we should actually do. The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Conservative leader</Affiliation> came out yesterday and said he has a brand new, shiny policy. He is going to get rid of the GST on any homes that are being built, as long as they are under $1 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655738">Now, I wonder where he got that idea from. Did he get it from some individuals who might be in a conflict? He possibly did. Maybe we should get the Ethics Commissioner or the Commissioner of Lobbying to take a look at where that idea originated from. I do not know where it came from. Maybe Canadians should know. Can the member clearly indicate and provide assurances that there is no one who would have provided him that advice who would have been in any form of a conflict whatsoever?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655739"> I remember when today's <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> actually came and met with the Liberal caucus, while we were a third party inside the chamber. She talked about Canada's middle class and provided us information and thinking in terms of how we could ultimately enhance and support it. That was of great value. I would like to think that caucuses invite people with different levels of expertise to their meetings. Some might use the expert as an adviser, whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, another minister or even me, to try to enhance the knowledge on an important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655740"> There is no need to assassinate the character just because they do not like that particular individual or they believe that individual might be in a conflict position if this star is here and that star is there. We can put on our tin hat, and this is what we think. After all, even though that person is not in the cabinet or a member of caucus, it could be inappropriate. Therefore, they want to try to get some news attention on it and, by the way, come up with a slogan. They have one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655741">There are people in Canada who have a lot to offer. People do not have to be an elected official in order to be able to come to the table and offer good advice. Whether they are a member of Parliament who just has an interest in a topic area, a cabinet minister specializing in one policy area or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada, I would like to think that we have an open mind to those individuals who have a certain level of expertise. I would argue that the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> today has more knowledge and ability to understand the issues of Canada's middle class than any other individual that I am aware of. Moreover, I have been aware of quite a few people over the years. She knows her stuff; that is why, at the end of the day, we see a healthier middle class in comparison with other countries. That is one of the reasons I was pleased to see the Deputy Prime Minister make a presentation to the national Liberal caucus at a time when we were in third party status; she could help us look at ways in which we could build sound public policy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655742"> Madam Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> put a great piece of policy forward this week. I am so glad my colleague mentioned it, and I hope he will support it. The policy is to axe the GST on homebuilding, and it was developed by anti-poverty advocates. These are people who are trying to fight for Canadians to have a break; in contrast, Mr. Carney is advising the Liberal Party in order to get rich himself. That is the difference. He is advocating for corporate interests whereas the Leader of the Opposition's policy was developed without any sort of ethical issue. Of course, I can absolutely say that. Mr. Carney, on the other hand, has a whole host of ethical issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8655743">The question is simple. This needs to be investigated by the lobbying commissioner. My colleague should have some shame in holding the bag on such a clear violation of, probably, the lobbying rules and other things. Mr. Carney should have some shame too. If he is such an esteemed individual, he should not be putting himself in this situation. Frankly, he should not be putting his boards up to this type of reputational risk. Seriously, it is really bad governance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8655744"> Madam Speaker, I am going to have to call the member. She just finished saying that, of course, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was advised on the policy he announced yesterday by anti-poverty advocates. We can think about that for a moment. How many homeless Canadians are going to benefit by purchasing a brand new house next year? How many anti-poverty advocates are really endorsing this particular announcement that people should not have to pay GST if they are going to spend $900,000 on a brand new house? By the way, the Conservatives would also be deleting all the other housing programs that are, in fact, supporting non-profit housing. It does not make any sense.</ParaText>
