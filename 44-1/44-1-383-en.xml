During its study, members of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates heard from witnesses who raised concerns regarding the state of the services being provided by Canada Post to Canadians living in rural and remote communities. While the main report contains some recommendations that are sound, it avoids addressing the most serious issues Canada Post faces in pursuing its mandate as a self-sustaining Crown corporation tasked with delivering quality mail services to all Canadians. Therefore, Conservatives can only partially agree with the recommendations contained in the main report. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8766989">This report comes at a crucial time when we are witnessing, globally, a terrifying backsliding on women's rights. We are living through a coordinated global backlash against sexual and reproductive rights for women, and we are seeing a global rise in authoritarianism. We are also seeing real barriers to access to reproductive and sexual health care here in Canada, and this is unacceptable because women's health care is a right and women's lives matter. </ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> obstructed the work of the committee for 18 hours, so we could not do any of the work we needed to do as the foreign affairs committee. I have to say, as well, that as a woman, being told for 18 hours what I can do with my body by a white male was extraordinarily difficult. I am sure it was very difficult for many women who were watching the proceedings in the room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767005">I want to talk a bit about the House and what our committee heard from the testimony. Julia Anderson of CanWaCH said Canada needed to develop a “cohesive strategy around [sexual and reproductive health and rights]” in Canada's foreign policy and that “investment alone is not enough.” Lauren Ravon of Oxfam Canada said that being effective was “a matter of combining money and voice.” Kelly Bowden of Action Canada argued that Canada “has a huge platform to stand on” because of investments made, but that we risk backsliding on women's rights if we do not leverage the opportunity to make more progress, especially through a more fulsome feminist foreign policy. Beth Woroniuk, a good friend of mine, noted that we still have not seen the government's “long-promised feminist foreign policy”, and in the absence of that document, “diplomats and aid workers are often not aware of what their responsibilities are”. Canada has not been clear, globally, with our partners. Dr. Kanem, of the UN Population Fund, told us that Canada needs to show global leadership on the issue now because the push-back on gender equality and women's and girls' rights is intensifying.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767009"> Madam Speaker, I want to talk a bit about the global context in which we find ourselves. What we are seeing globally is terrifying: ongoing violence against women, restrictions on women's access to reproductive and sexual health care, rising support for extreme-right politicians and political parties in several countries, a weakening of our democratic institutions and a growth in far-right misogynistic attitudes and movements that is provoking growing levels of sexual and gender-based violence around the world. Anti-trans violence is on the rise globally, with trans women of colour being the most at risk. Moreover, attacks, intimidation, threats and harassment against women politicians are growing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767010">These are all evidence of a backlash against women's rights and feminist movements. It is necessary for all of us to fight for women and gender-diverse people, as well as for those of us who are in positions of power to use our voice for that. We are seeing increased attacks on gender equality and sexual and reproductive rights at the United Nations, in national political and legislative processes, online, in schools and in our communities. We know these attacks share common tactics, strategies and funders across borders, and they are linked to broader white supremacist, anti-democratic, anti-human rights and oppressive regimes and political actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767011">In 2021, a report by the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights documented funding from Russian oligarchs to anti-abortion organizations across Europe. These are the same oligarchs who have been sanctioned for their role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which President Putin has framed as defence of “traditional values”. Globally, the people who deny women their rights are the same people who praise authoritarian tactics and policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767012">We do not get to escape this. What is happening in the United States and in other countries is proof that we cannot assume our rights will remain protected in Canada. Today, access to reproductive health services is severely restricted for some people in Canada, including those in indigenous, rural, remote and northern communities, as well as in provinces where the federal government has not done enough to ensure access is available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767013">We have also seen strong opposition to examining abortion and reproductive rights in the House of Commons, led by members of the Conservative Party, many of whom get support from anti-abortion groups. In Canada, there are over 300 documented anti-abortion organizations trying to dissuade people from accessing the health care they are entitled to. They use a variety of tactics, including disseminating misinformation and disinformation. Many are affiliated with U.S.-based organizations. They mimic their talking points around “traditional values”. They reject the advancements of a range of human rights related to sexuality and gender. They are emboldened by the support of the Conservative Party of Canada. The anti-choice movement is calling the shots for the Conservatives. This is very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767014">Restricting access to reproductive health options for women does not stop abortions from happening; it simply stops safe abortions from happening. Racialized people, those from households of lower socio-economic levels, young people and other marginalized people are always those who bear the burden of these retro policies. Predominantly white, wealthy women will always have access to the reproductive services they require because they have the means to access them. New Democrats will continue to resist attacks on the human rights of women, trans people and all people by the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767015">Abortion is health care. It is wrong for governments to set barriers between women and the care they choose for their own bodies and the future they choose for themselves and for their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767016">Public universal health care, including abortion, is part of Canada and of our Canadian values. Today, too many pregnant Canadians have the heart-wrenching experience of calling to find that abortion care is not available, that roadblocks have been put up in their place, that long waits or even a price tag is attached. Members should make no mistake: This does not have to be the way we do this. We have seen the Liberals let women and gender-diverse people down. Their actions have not matched their words. The Liberals are too weak to stand up to those Conservative premiers who are restricting women's access to health care.</ParaText>

Every single person, man, woman or child, should have access to the health care they require. This is a fundamental principle that New Democrats believe in.

              <ParaText id="8767038">There has been an alarming rollback of women's rights around the world. In my community of Port Moody—Coquitlam, it came right home to our families with the killing of Mahsa Amini.

It is all rooted in misogyny.</ParaText>

In Afghanistan, women are not allowed to speak in public. They have been erased from public life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767041"> There are more countries where women cannot receive the most basic of human rights. The list is long. One of the countries we never could have imagined is the United States. I never would have thought that in 2024, women would lose their right to basic health care just because of their sex, but it is happening. As women in the United States face increasing restrictions on their reproductive rights, including access to safe and legal abortions, Canada has an obligation to step forward as an ally to women and to advocate for women and diverse genders. No one would have predicted when the study was taking place and finalized that such discrimination would happen so close to us, just south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767042"> It is important for Canada to be prepared and to do its part to save lives. One of the most tangible ways Canada can help is by making it possible for U.S. women to access abortion services in Canada. This could include expanding the availability of abortion services, particularly in border communities, and ensuring that Canadian health care facilities can accommodate patients travelling from the U.S. The federal government could work with NGOs that could offer logistical assistance, travel coordination and financial aid to U.S. women and girls seeking care in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767043">An absolute must is for Canada to leverage its position on the global stage to advocate for reproductive rights as human rights. Through international forums like the United Nations, Canada must work to pressure the U.S. to respect and protect these rights. These are the important conversations that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should also be having with the president-elect, who has bragged about overturning Roe v.

              <ParaText id="8767050">I will now go back to the report on what Canada needs to continue to do to protect sexual and reproductive rights across the globe. Canada needs to “speak out clearly and consistently in global forums and bilateral discussions” on sexual and reproductive rights for women, and the government must release the “long-promised feminist foreign policy” that my colleague, the member from <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation>, referenced. Having a clear written document is important because, as she referenced, it sets out feminist policy guidelines, not just for international development but also for trade, immigration, diplomacy and consulate affairs work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767051"> Canada can be a leader, a beacon of hope at a time when there is push-back on gender equality and the rights of women, diverse genders and girls. If the government does the work now to protect women's rights, more Canadian women and women across the globe will be safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767052">Multiple witnesses in the study stressed to the committee that legal restrictions on abortion do not stop abortions from happening. Instead, these restrictions increase the proportion of abortions that are unsafe. Julia Anderson, one of the witnesses, stated the following: “The evidence is unanimous and clear that the restriction of abortion does not stop abortion; it only increases unsafe abortion, and it loses women's lives.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767053"> Why is Canada not investing in abortion access here at home and abroad? The reality is that, despite what is known about the consequences of unsafe abortion, Canada allocated only less than $2 million in support of safe abortion services. Kelly Bowden, a witness in the study, noted that while the Government of Canada is naming access to safe abortions as part of a comprehensive package of care, it is not putting the money in that area just yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767054"> I will close out today by highlighting recommendation 9 from the report, which recommends Canada “scales-up its assistance for sexual and reproductive health and rights globally, the Government of Canada ensure it is fully supporting access to modern forms of contraception, safe and legal abortion services, and post-abortion care.” Canada must do this here, at home, just south of the border and across the globe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767072">I want to start by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> for bringing up this vitally important issue and also for bringing up the fact that, for 18 hours, it was filibustered in committee by the Conservatives, because I think that says something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767073"> People say that abortion rights are not up for discussion in Canada, and they ask why we are even talking about it. This is why we have to talk about it, because American women also did not think that abortion rights were up for discussion. We really thought that. For our mothers, our aunts and those who had to fight for those rights, we thought that the debate was over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767074">Now we look across, and at every opportunity, the Conservatives will avoid, at any measure, a vote on this issue, because they do not want to admit that there is a huge majority in that caucus who actually stand against a woman's right to choose. This is something I think every Canadian woman is extremely concerned about. As such, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> for that motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767075"> I would like to start with a personal story. There is a member of my family of that generation that had to fight for these rights, a close member of my family, who at one point found that she was pregnant with a child that was severely handicapped. When she first immigrated to Canada, she worked in a sector with a lot of severely handicapped people, and she was deeply religious, deeply Catholic. When she found herself pregnant, she thought and prayed very much about what the right thing to do was. After going through a process where she made that choice between herself and her faith, she had to go in front of three male doctors and defend her decision, and those doctors decided that she could not have an abortion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767076"> This family member was despondent. She already had two young children, two girls, and she did not pass a psychological evaluation, because of the impact of being told, after she had prayed and come to this decision between herself and her husband, that she could not do it. Thankfully, there was a geneticist, a woman and doctor, who helped her and arranged for her to go to the United States, to Seattle, so that she could have autonomy over her own body and her own life choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767077"> That case was one of the cases in the Morgentaler decision, which overturned that draconian abortion law in this country that said a woman had to go in front of a panel of doctors, mostly men, to justify her decision and her autonomy. I am very proud of that woman, that family member of mine. I think that, because of her, women in this country have autonomy over our own bodies. I am so proud of her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767078"> I do not want to have to redo this debate, but sadly, we do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767079">When it comes to the reason I ran, the moment I decided that I was going to run for office in this country, I was working internationally. I was working in Africa. I was working in other parts of the world. At one point, the regional coordinator for my project, which was about women in politics, was from sub-Saharan Africa, a young woman from Mali. All of a sudden, in 2010, which was in the Harper years, the government cut funding to any international organization, no matter what other good things it was doing, if it also provided abortion. The government did it with absolutely no warning. In the coordinator's country of Mali, a clinic that had been there for 40 years, which provided all kinds of health services, which she went to as a child and which that community benefited from, was suddenly closed, just because one of the things that clinic provided was abortion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767080">That coordinator got on Skype with me at that time in 2010, and she said, “You Canadian women are hypocrites.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767081"> I was stunned. I sort of took a moment, and I asked, “Why would you say that?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767082"> She said, “Because I went to Montreal and I studied at McGill. I know Canadian women have reproductive rights, but your government shut down a clinic in my village out of ideology. Now I know that Canadians think that it is not good enough for us African women to also have the same rights that you Canadian women have.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767083"> I was ashamed. I was actually so ashamed at that moment to be Canadian and to have my government, at that time the Harper government, do this kind of thing, which was so harmful to so many people, that I decided I had to run for office. I did not win that 2011 election, but I won in 2015.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767084"> I fought hard the minute I was elected, alongside many women in this chamber, to get our feminist international assistance policy, FIAP, in place, and I was able to come full circle just a little while ago this January.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767085"> As a result of FIAP, as a result of the fact that we are putting $700 million a year into SRHR, that we are the number one donor to the UNFPA and that, when the Americans pulled back, we stepped up, I went to a clinic in Kinshasa, the country where I worked before I was elected. This clinic offers, among other things, safe abortion services. I met a young girl who was in her twenties. She told me that when she was 16 and she was raped, she had nowhere to go, but then she found out about this clinic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767086">It is because she was able to get a safe abortion in this clinic, she is now planning to go to medical school to become a doctor so that she can help other people. However, that young woman could have been dead, because 10% of maternal deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo are because of unsafe abortions. When we say that we do not want to provide abortion, we do not want to have SRHR or we do not want young women knowing their rights all over the world, we are killing women, because that is 10% of maternal deaths. We are saving lives with this policy by supporting SRHR. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767087">I was so proud of those young women. There was a group of marginalized youth who sat in a circle with me and talked about what our funding for this clinic meant to them. It was the young girls, the teenagers, who were saying that they were talking to the traditional leaders. They are talking to the faith leaders, and they are explaining. One young woman said to me, “I understand my rights, and I want to make sure that every young woman understands her rights.” These strong, incredible young women are the future, the new leadership of Africa and of the world, and they are working side-by-side with the older generations to ensure that this is something that is accepted and understood. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767088">This is not ideology. This is saving lives. This is giving rights. This is giving autonomy. This is ensuring that we have generations of young women who do not have to go through what my family member went through: the indignity and the injustice of being told, “No, you can't have an abortion.” That woman in my family still prays for that baby. She honestly says to this day, and I think she is watching, that she believes that the little baby, whom she named Jennifer, is in heaven thanking her for saving her from a life of pain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767089">Now, that might not be everyone's choice in this place. I know that there are so many babies born with severe disabilities who are loved, but that is not the point of this discussion. The point of this discussion is that this woman made her choice by her own conscience, and she was overruled. No woman should ever be in this position, whether here in Canada or in other parts of the world, when, after tremendous thought, and with whatever faith she might believe in or not, she comes to a choice about her own body. I will never accept it, and I will stand in the House to the very last day to make sure that nobody on that side is ever going to force a woman to carry a child to term that she does not want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767090">We are saving lives. This debate is absolutely 100% necessary. I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> for giving us the opportunity to put our words on the record.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767107"> Madam Speaker, I rise today to participate in debate on the concurrence motion that has been put forward by the NDP. For those who might be watching and are not fully aware of what happened in the House today, I would like to set the picture so they can appreciate what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767108">We originally had the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> here, who was going to lead off on his opposition motion today. He came and he sat in his seat. He was flanked, in the perfect formation behind him to get the best camera angle, by his most loyal MPs. They sat there. They were all ready to go and we could see him getting ready. He was ready to kick off the day with his great speech that he probably conjured up in his mind while in the shower this morning. Then moments before he had the opportunity to rise to do that, and to have the excitement of his members behind him cheering him on endlessly, suddenly the NDP did to the Conservatives what they have been doing to the House for three months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767109">For three months now, the Conservatives have been putting up concurrence motions to filibuster and to prevent this House from doing any business. I must admit, I found it absolutely wild earlier when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278689" Type="2">Hastings—Lennox and Addington</Affiliation>, my neighbour, challenged the government and the NDP on procedural tactics, when the Conservatives have been doing that for three solid months. The NDP did nothing more to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and the Conservatives today than what the Conservatives have been doing for months. They just got a taste of their own medicine this morning. That is it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767110">It was quite a moment. I sat in my chair and saw that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> knew right away what happened. He jumped out of his seat and he marched right out of here, leaving the flank of MPs sitting behind him in the perfect formation absolutely bewildered. They had no idea what had just happened. The Leader of the Opposition did not bother telling them. He just marched right out of here because he knew exactly what had happened. He left them behind to wonder what possibly could have just occurred and why their great leader was not giving his amazing speech right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767111">That is what happened. That is what the NDP did. Unfortunately, that is what this place has turned into. It has turned into a tit-for-tat. If they do something to us, we are going to do something to them. We are going to have procedural games here; we are going to have procedural games there. However, I will hand it to the NDP members for one thing. They brought forward an issue that is incredibly important in today's political context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767112">We have, regrettably, seen a regression, with the loudest voices out there, the voices that appear to be the most influential or incredibly influential, trying desperately to roll back the clock on women's rights. I said in a question earlier today that my mother participated in the movement to secure these rights back in the 1980s. I remember as a child wondering what she was doing and what that was all about, because I did not fully understand it. What I do know, and I fully understand today, is my wife benefited from that incredible work my mother's generation did and her mother's generation did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767113">Now, unfortunately, I am left wondering what the future holds for my daughter. I hear Conservatives, and I mean small-c conservatives and big-C Conservatives, talk about rolling back a woman's right to choose. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767114">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767115">
                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Madam Speaker, I hear them saying, “Oh God, what is he talking about?” I will tell members exactly what I am talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767116">I am talking about their colleagues who go on documentaries and are asked questions like, “Is it possible for us to completely ban abortion, or is it crazy to even think about it?” That question was asked of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278476" Type="2">Peace River—Westlock</Affiliation>, who we know to be at the centre of the Conservative Party of Canada's movement, along with one or two other MPs, to do exactly that. This was his answer to that question: “Anything is possible. I thought that overturning Roe v. Wade in the United States was impossible, but yet here we are today.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767117">Anybody out there who happens to have CPAC on today and is watching this can google the <Affiliation DbId="278476" Type="2">Peace River—Westlock</Affiliation> MP and “banning abortion”, go into the video section and find the video almost instantly. Conservatives roll their eyes and say the Liberals, NDP and progressives are just trying to paint them as bad guys, but they would never actually do that. Then why are their MPs making these comments? Why do they have MPs who participate in the pro-life marches in front of this place every spring and get up to the microphone and actually say, “We can do this”? That is what they do. They should not try to dismiss it or suggest it is not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767118">What else do Conservatives do? They continually line up candidates to run for them who have well-known positions of being anti-choice. That is what Canadians are faced with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767119">For those out there who may want to believe the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> when he says he would never ban abortion, just look at his track record, and that of Stephen Harper, saying he would never do those kind of things. They will. They might not do it in a very direct form of introducing a bill that says, “We ban abortion”, but they will do it in other ways. They will do it by taking money and resources away from institutions and agencies that educate and inform women, and by providing resources to those who would like to suppress that right. They will do it through private members' bills and say, “Oh, this is just a private members' bill; it is up for anybody to vote on. Members can vote their conscience; that is what private members' bills are all about.” That is how they will do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767120">For those out there who think that if the Conservative Party of Canada forms government, they will bring in a bill that says, “We ban abortion,” the Conservatives will not do it like that; they will do it in more calculated ways to achieve their end objective without being so transparent. It is extremely important that this issue be taken seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767121">To give more context to the Conservative Party of Canada, the Campaign Life Coalition has three ratings: green, yellow and red. Green means it totally supports the candidate because they believe in the group's values. Yellow means it does not know but thinks the candidate can be influenced. Red means the candidate would never support the group in this endeavour. The Campaign Life Coalition has 40 MPs currently sitting in the House it has deemed green and another 40 MPs it has deemed yellow. That is 80 sitting MPs. The Campaign Life Coalition deems a majority of the Conservative caucus appropriate to represent its views.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767122">Nobody should be fooled by the false narrative of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. The Conservatives will prohibit and restrict a woman's right to choose. They will not do it in a very transparent and obvious way, like introducing a bill, but they will certainly do it in other ways. We need to stand up to protect the work that my mother's generation did. We also need to stand up for future generations, for my daughter and her generation, so they can live with the same experiences my wife benefited from that came from those who did the work in the 1970s and 1980s.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767123">Madam Speaker, one of the deep fears I have is that there is a creeping attack on women's rights in Canada and around the world. We know that, under Stephen Harper, the Conservative Party cut all supports for reproductive health care with regard to Global Affairs Canada and international affairs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767124">The member spoke about some of the members of Parliament who are named as being supportive of attacks on women's health care, but I have to point out that there are members on his bench who are also named. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278255" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> have also been added to that list. Therefore, we have to be aware that there are people within the government and the opposition who do not fundamentally believe women have a right to health care. That should be a concern for every one of us in the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767126">I will remind the member that our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who was a leader at the time in 2014, made it very clear that if a person wanted to sit in the Liberal Party, they must vote in favour of legislation that protects a woman's right to choose, full stop. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767127">I also want to say the member was right when she said Conservatives will slowly take away money and resources. That is how they will do it. They are not going to show up here on day one, if they form government, and introduce Bill C-1, which would say they ban a woman's right to choose; they are going to show up here and, one by one, through budget bills and other measures, remove those resources and make it more difficult for a woman to have that right to choose.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767130">I wonder if my colleague could speak to the many ways the government is working to enhance women's rights, certainly through the right to choose, but also through programs like $10-a-day child care, pharmacare, the school lunch program and ways we give women the ability to be financially independent and able to make choices within the family. We can really move this conversation out to all of the things we do through housing, access to food and finances, and also the right to choose what we do with our bodies. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767132">However, I think the member is talking about a broader issue: How do we give women the tools to properly be equals in society. Unfortunately, we see Conservative policies and positions that try to roll that back. She is absolutely right when she talks about $10-a-day child care. We know women are more often the ones who stay at home with children. This is about making sure they have the choice, that if they want to go into the workforce, they are not subject to having to stay at home because they do not have child care. </ParaText>

I would like to take a moment to recognize our fantastic critic for foreign affairs, who also serves as vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. I am speaking here today because my colleague was kind enough to share his speaking time with me, as well as invite me to ask witnesses questions at certain committee meetings when it was conducting the study that led to the report we are debating today. I want to thank him. It gave me a lot to think about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767182">Most of my speech today is based on the Bloc Québécois's supplementary opinion on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development's study on sexual and reproductive rights around the world. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767185">That being said, I will begin by quoting what some of the witnesses said about the accountability of this government with respect to feminist policy. I will talk more specifically about certain parts of the world. Then, I would like to talk about secularism, which is a very important value in Quebec. </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Firstly, it was surprising to hear from witnesses that almost 7 years after its announcement, Canada's feminist foreign policy is still not defined through a document that details principles, objectives and implementation guidelines. This may potentially explain why sharing results in this area seems difficult for Global Affairs Canada. So, on the one hand, we have GAC announcing during the study that “Canada is making significant progress in meeting its existing commitments”. On the other hand, we have the Auditor General's assertion that Canada's feminist international aid policy includes commitments describing how the funds are to be spent, “...but had no goals related to specific improvements in the circumstances of those who benefit from the funding”.</QuotePara>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Secondly, Africa is an area where the issue of sexual rights is debated, as we heard from several witnesses who discussed cultural differences, and the need for Canada to work in this part of the world. One statistic sums up the problems associated with reproductive rights: sub-Saharan Africa accounted for some 70% of maternal deaths in 2020. Canada has a duty to support countries seeking to make progress in terms of abortion rights and access to quality health care — COVID-19 having imposed, in some countries, additional difficulties in accessing health care, particularly in terms of distance.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8767191">Keep in mind that these remarks were made in committee, particularly by Global Affairs Canada representatives, but the Auditor General also released a report on international assistance in support of gender equality. UNICEF representatives also testified in committee, and the Canadian Partnership for Women and Children's Health submitted a brief. We heard from a lot of witnesses, and all of them seemed to highlight the need to strive for greater accountability.</ParaText>

Ms. Théroux-Séguin of the Centre d'étude et de coopération internationale, in her testimony, expressed the hope that Canada could support legislative measures, and promote recommendations aimed at improving sexual and reproductive health. We therefore hope that the Canadian government, through a statement or in international forums, will take the lead in welcoming the development of projects that provide greater access to abortion and reproductive health services around the world. While interfering in the national policy processes of other countries is out of the question, Canada must nonetheless be vocal and offer assistance to countries that request it, to enable the development of essential reproductive health care services. </QuotePara>

Cases of HIV-AIDS are on the rise in certain places in Africa, and again, women are disproportionately affected. As I said, there are also sexually transmitted infections. To that category, we can add HPV, human papillomavirus, which can be avoided through vaccination. We were reminded of the World Health Organization's vaccination objectives, because it is a virus that can lead to cancer but that is preventable by vaccine. Canada is missing its target, however. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done on these issues.</ParaText>

Witnesses came to testify in committee about religious opposition to the question of abortion out of principle and religious belief, which is harming women's health. It is not right for people to use religion in such a way that women have to pay for it with their lives or their health. I will go even further. One should not use religion to engage in hate speech. This is an opportunity to re-emphasize the importance of secularism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767213">I could talk about the situation of women in Iran, which relates to this issue of secularism. The Bloc Québécois was the first to move a motion following the death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed for wearing her veil improperly. It is absurd that today, in 2024, women are still dying for not wearing a piece of cloth properly. We will continue supporting Iranian women in their struggle for secularism. The same applies to Afghanistan. The Taliban regime is rolling back women's rights. In my Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings I have had exchanges with Afghani parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767214">To get back to the October 2022 general assembly, I met with parliamentarians there, but only male parliamentarians. I was told that women had not won the right to leave the country. They had not managed to get the proper chaperone, which would have allowed them to attend this general assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to express themselves as female members of parliament. This issue is crucial, because the objective of this general assembly was to determine how to achieve a more representative, and hence democratic, kind of parliament. We need to hear these women's viewpoints. They are entitled to be present in the public sphere, which is not the case right now. They are being excluded, and the rights they had won in Afghanistan are being rolled back. This is extremely troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767215">I will take this opportunity to remind my fellow members of the importance of the Bloc Québécois bill aimed at repealing this religious exemption. Ottawa must take concrete action to counter hate speech, which has been rising especially since the start of the war in the Middle East. What we are seeing now, however, is that the Criminal Code still protects people who willingly foment hate when their words are uttered in good faith and based on a religious text in which they believe.</ParaText>

Right here, right now, it is creating tension and conflict. It is for this reason that the Bloc Québécois introduced Bill <Document DbId="12734364" Type="4">C-367</Document>. It was to close this loophole in the Criminal Code that permits hate speech if it is ultimately motivated by religion. Unfortunately, the content of the bill apparently did not please the government, which we have a hard time understanding, considering it calls itself feminist. Separating church and state gives women power. That is really what we found out from the committee study. The witnesses who came to tell us that abortion is bad were hiding behind religious beliefs and motivations. I would like to remind my colleagues that women are still dying today in countries where they do not have access to safe abortions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767217">In conclusion, now more than ever, Canada needs to update its feminist foreign policy and respond to the Auditor General's questions and concerns. COVID-19 and the growing number of conflicts and natural disasters caused by climate change are all factors that are changing the world order and current priorities. As a G7 nation, Canada must step up and start walking the talk. It is our duty to help women and girls in all these places around the world where they are being subjected to heinous sexual acts and losing their rights. We have to do our part. That is what the world is asking us to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767218">The major international co-operation organizations are reminding us of our obligations as a G7 nation. There are female parliamentarians on the ground who are worried. Just a few days ago, female MPs from Ukraine came to tell us about advancements that have been made possible thanks to technology, but also to share their concerns. They need our help to continue participating in the democratic life of their country. The same is true for all women in situations of conflict or war. They need help to regain their rights as women, to have access to safe sexual and reproductive health care and to play their role in society to the fullest. We should not leave them stuck in this situation where the only thing that is happening is an erosion of their rights. On that note, I urge everyone to take action, and I am ready to take questions from my colleagues.</ParaText>

I think that is something else we need to consider. We must also ensure that the money is spent and that cuts are not made to international co-operation budgets. The local organizations are worried about cuts, too. The Canadian government must pull its own weight. To that end, it must not divest from international co-operation, but maintain its commitment levels by spending the necessary money to rectify the situation.</ParaText>

What happened is no trifling matter. The Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats brought victims to tears in their attempt to politicize this issue. It was absolutely horrible. The media decried the situation. I let victims recount their experiences with domestic violence, their right to be women and to be free of this violence. Unfortunately, instead of asking these women questions and doing their job, all three parties got bogged down on a procedural question to determine who defends women's rights more.

In fact, it is already happening. Masculinism is clawing back the rights women acquired thanks to those feminists who paved the way for today's women through decades of struggle. Now we see that, because of misogyny and the rise of masculinism online, women's rights are being eroded. At committee, many witnesses have come to tell us how important it is to control what can be said online and how far hate speech like this can go. This is not just a religious issue. It is an issue of hate speech undermining women's rights.</ParaText>

In fact, the NDP has one coming up. However, now that we have broken the gridlock, what do they do? They block the work of the House again, because of course they do. We have been saying for weeks and months that we needed to end the gridlock in the House. We managed to get an agreement restoring the Conservative and NDP opposition days. I know they will bring this up again during their opposition days. At least, that is what we have heard. They could still revisit the issue. I am not in their party, I do not know what they will say, but they have an opposition day coming up. What we just did this morning, though, was to relaunch a procedural war, just when we had broken the gridlock. That is what is bothering me right now.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8767242">Mr. Speaker, I will start by saying that this is an important, productive debate. When we see the backsliding not only south of the border but also here in Canada, it is critical that we rise in the House to discuss the issue of a woman's fundamental right to choose. This is foundational to gender equity, to public health and to human dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767243"> Access to abortion care is health care, both here in Canada and around the world. This is a conversation about rights. It is not abstract principles. It is the lived experience of women and gender-diverse people, as well as the tangible rights of these people in our country. Canada has been a leader in affirming abortion as a fundamental right. In 1988, the Supreme Court's decision struck down restrictive abortion laws as unconstitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767244">The Conservatives like to talk about freedom. They wave freedom flags, but when it comes to the freedom of a woman to make choices about her own body, about our own bodies, for some reason, those freedoms are up for grabs. The majority of Conservative MPs are anti-choice. One-third of them are openly campaigning on anti-choice legislation and are endorsed by anti-choice organizations. However, if we look at their voting records, we see that the vast majority of them are anti-choice. According to the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, 100% of Conservative MPs are anti-choice, given their recent vote on backdoor legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767245">Bill <Document DbId="12174725" Type="4">C-311</Document> is very similar to the bills down south that Republican elected officials used to undermine Roe v. Wade. We are seeing the same tactics in Canada. Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> is saying that Conservatives promise they will not support legislation that bans abortion. This is despite the fact that the Conservative leader voted five times in favour of legislation that would restrict access to choice or voted in favour of anti-choice bills, such as Bill C-311. However, we know that his intention is to cut health care, services and funding internationally for reproductive rights, as the Harper government did when the Conservative leader was a minister in that government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767246">Anti-choice rhetoric is finding a firmer foothold here in Canada. It is amplified in the House by the Conservative members. It is paraded around by such members as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278476" Type="2">Peace River—Westlock</Affiliation>, who went outside the House of Commons to anti-choice rallies and made commitments to his supporters, to the supporters of the Conservative Party, to fight to end a woman's right to choose and to restrict access to choice, to health care for women and for gender-diverse people across this country. He is not the only Conservative MP to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767247">The MP for <Affiliation DbId="278230" Type="2">Cypress Hills—Grasslands</Affiliation> took a paid trip down to a church in the United States. A pro-life, anti-choice church brought him down to speak about his stance on trying to end a woman's right to choose. To have Conservative MPs going to the United States to learn new tactics, to collaborate, to organize with anti-choice activists there and to bring that back to Canada is terrifying. It is terrifying to me, and I think it is terrifying to women across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767248">I also want to bring up the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>. Not only has the member been vocal about being against a woman's right to choose, but he also spent 18 hours filibustering this report because he did not want to talk about the fundamental right of women in Canada and around the world to access abortion care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767249">It tracks that the Conservatives want to cut funding for reproductive rights. Abortion care is health care. Whether it is for a broken leg, heart surgery or abortion care, Canadians need access to health care, to quality health care across this country. Conservatives have a track record of cutting that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767250">Unfortunately the Liberals have a track record of failing to uphold the Canada Health Act. I have spoken about this in the House before. About two decades ago I was sitting with a friend in New Brunswick, in grade 11, talking about the multi-hour drive to Montreal she would have to take if she wanted to access abortion. I am getting choked up because it is a horrific reality that so many women in Canada face when they do not have access to the care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767251">I could not have imagined that two decades later, Clinic 554 in Fredericton, New Brunswick, would close and that the Liberal government would not use the provisions in the Canada Health Act that it knows it could use to ensure access for all women in British Columbia and for all people across this country. Our health care system guarantees Canadians the right to access medically necessary services. Abortion is that kind of service, yet those kinds of clinic closures demonstrate the fragility of access to care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767252"> I think about women and gender diverse people in Alberta, whose provincial Conservatives have outsourced health care to private institutions and religious institutions that will not provide contraception and abortion care to the women who need them. Those are systemic barriers that hinder equitable access. The lack of leadership from the federal government to enforce the Canada Health Act makes these barriers worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767253">I also want to talk about our responsibility globally. We need to demonstrate leadership when it comes to prioritizing sexual health and reproductive health on the global stage, including through our international assistance policy. We know about the cuts that happened during the Harper era. The Harper government cut all funding to reproductive health, reproductive services and sexual health services around the globe. Canada has a responsibility to step up to support nations around the world in accessing health care and reproductive care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767254">I find it difficult when Conservative members talk about the rights of the unborn or try to sneak legislation in that has increased penalties for the murder of pregnant women or the harm of an unborn child. Evidence shows that limiting access to abortions or restricting women's choice does not stop abortions; it just means that unsafe abortions happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767255">When we restrict comprehensive reproductive health services, everyone suffers. When we ensure that access exists, societies prosper. Investing in the services reduces maternal mortality, improves economic opportunities for women and promotes equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767256"> It is our duty as parliamentarians to protect and promote these rights. We cannot allow a vocal minority in Canada that has influence over the official opposition to undermine these rights. We cannot allow it to undermine decades of work that feminist organizations and people across Canada have fought to protect. We must act decisively. We need to ensure compliance, enforce the Canada Health Act, ensure that we are eliminating any kind of user fee and provide equitable abortion access in every province.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767257"> We need to invest strategically and expand funding for clinics and services in rural and underserved areas. We need to ensure that midwives, nurse practitioners, nurses and family doctors are available for people when they need assistance with their reproductive health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767258">We need to combat misinformation, challenge the anti-choice narratives and ensure that facts are brought into the House and that we have rights-driven education campaigns. We must not allow backdoor legislation to undermine these rights, and we must not allow the vocal minority that wants to undermine our right to choose to have influence over the decisions of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767259">Access to abortion is a domestic issue, but the report focuses on the global issue of human rights with respect to public health. Around the world, millions of women face unsafe abortions because of restrictive laws, lack of resources and systemic inequalities. Each year, 35 million unsafe abortions occur globally. That is a horrific statistic. Unsafe abortions lead to preventable deaths and life-altering injuries. Canada must be a global leader in supporting sexual and reproductive health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767260">It is terrifying to think of what Conservatives would do to abortion rights here in Canada if they were in power. It is horrific to think about the consequences of the cuts they would make to international assistance around the world and what that would mean for women who are trying to access reproductive care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767261">The world is at a crossroads. Some countries are advancing abortion rights, but others, and I think we see this in the Conservative caucus, are emboldened by movements in the United States to overturn Roe v. Wade. There is a backslide happening. Our leadership at this moment matters. By standing firm, Canada can continue to support the global efforts to ensure that every woman and every person, including all gender diverse people everywhere, has the right to make decisions about their own body.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767262">We have talked before about Conservative creep for this kind of legislation, the changes in tone and rhetoric and also the changes to the laws that would have a fundamental impact on people's right to choose. I want to speak directly to young women and young gender diverse people who might be looking at the prospect of the Conservatives' getting into power and undermining their rights. Their voice right now matters. Their organizing matters. Standing up for their right to choose matters. It matters to have these discussions in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767263"> I am disappointed that the Bloc decided to try to kill the debate. I am not surprised that the Conservatives would do that. I know there are staunch supporters in the Bloc of a woman's right to choose, but I am still disappointed that at this moment, when we are at a crossroads on reproductive and sexual health, the Bloc would do that, especially given that every other time a motion like the one before us has come up to return to orders of the day, 36 times its members voted against it. I thought it was a matter of principle, but then the one time that they vote to kill debate is on a woman's right to choose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767264">New Democrats will always stand in unwavering support of abortion rights. We will not let regressive policies and regressive members of Parliament take us backward. We will fight back against the misinformation and the rhetoric that try to undermine our fundamental rights.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767266">Together let us affirm the right to choose, not as a procedural tactic and not as something to bring up in order to score political points, but as a cornerstone of gender equality.

              <ParaText id="8767272">Before asking her a question, I would just like to get back to her tone when she accused the Bloc Québécois of siding with the Conservatives on the question of voting to get back to the orders of the day. She said we had voted 36 times. The only two times we voted to get back to the orders of the day had to do with following procedure. Both times, it was because the NDP had pulled the rug out from under the Conservative Party during its opposition day. There is a matter of principle at play here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767273">The report came out in June 2023. If my colleague was so keen on debating it, I do not see why the NDP waited so long before putting it back on the agenda. What is more, our NDP colleagues also have an opposition day this week. We voted to get back to the orders of the day because we are not engaging in these sorts of tactics, even though, when it comes to the subject at hand, I admit that we find this debate far more worthwhile than the one proposed by the Conservatives during their opposition day. I think the subject is important enough for us not to get embroiled in petty politics, as seems to be the case here. This is very unlike my colleague from Victoria. I just wanted to point that out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767274">Now, as for the subject at hand, there is something that concerns me. Canada is contributing financially to support developing countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767275">Does my colleague think that Canada should ensure, because this is not entirely the case, that the developing countries it supports have values and should provide their citizens access to sexual and reproductive rights and to care, such as abortion? Should Canada include that as a prerequisite to receiving financial support?</ParaText>

There are Conservatives who are continually starting to push this agenda of rolling back a woman's right to choose. However, I actually do not think that, if they ever formed government, they would be so bold as to bring in a piece of legislation that banned abortion. What I think they would do is take other measures, such as defunding certain organizations, slowly removing some of those rights or working around and chipping away at those rights, as opposed to one bold action, which others might assume they would do. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767293">It is extraordinarily disappointing to me that we have members in the House who would try to undermine a woman's right to choose, and we know they are in the Conservative caucus. Over one-third of the Conservative caucus is endorsed by anti-choice groups as pro-life, a.k.a. they want to undermine a woman's right to choose, and 73% are rated as anti-choice MPs by the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767294">Actually, it was 73%, but now 100% of them are rated anti-choice because of their vote on Bill <Document DbId="12174725" Type="4">C-311</Document>, which is the same kind of legislation that Republican elected officials brought in the United States to start undermining a woman's right to choose and overturn Roe versus Wade.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8767341">Mr. Speaker, I am proposing an emergency debate tonight based on the report that came out yesterday from Amnesty International, concluding that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. This finding of genocide from the world's most respected human rights organization has immediate implications for the Government of Canada and for every single member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767342">In short, Canada must change course immediately, given such a conclusion, or the government may be found complicit in genocide by the International Court of Justice. This has serious implications for Canada's reputation internationally and for Canada's adherence to international law. It also requires that Canada do much more to end the genocide in Gaza and to withdraw its political and military support for Israel while the genocide is ongoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767343">This report is meticulous in its research on Israeli authorities, policies and actions in Gaza as part of the military offensive they launched in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. It situates these actions “within the broader context of Israel’s unlawful occupation” and what Amnesty calls a “system of apartheid against Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.” It assesses allegations of violations and crimes under international law by Israel in Gaza within the framework of genocide under international law, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel’s conduct in Gaza following October 7, 2023, amounts to genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767344">I note that Amnesty is also working on a research report on the horrific crimes committed by Hamas on October 7 of last year. We anticipate that this report will detail the egregious violations of international law by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, and the need for accountability under the international justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767345"> I further note that this report is specific to Israel's actions. Amnesty requests an arms embargo apply to Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups operating in Gaza. It also advocates for sanctions on both Israeli and Hamas officials implicated in crimes under international law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767346">The New Democrats support these calls and we believe that all perpetrators, Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, all perpetrators in the region, must be held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767347"> The report states that Amnesty has found “sufficient basis to conclude that Israel committed, between 7 October 2023 and July 2024, prohibited acts under the Genocide Convention, namely killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767348">This is why I am asking for an emergency debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767364">Let us go through this point by point to prove the charge of the NDP <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation>. He says that the Liberals are too weak. He is right about that. The economy is weak, having lost $500 billion of net investment to the United States; having shrunk the last eight quarters in a row, on a per capita basis; having seen the productivity per hour worked in Canada drop for six quarters in a row. Our economy is now smaller than it was 10 years ago. We have gone from having median incomes equal to American median incomes to the present, where the American worker makes $22,000 more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767365">Our economy is shrinking in per capita terms. The cost of living is out of reach. We have two million people lined up at food banks. We have double the housing costs and the worst housing price inflation in the G7. Vancouver and Toronto are the most expensive housing markets in all of North America. We recognize that, economically, the Liberals have made the country weak. Then there is politically weak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767366"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has lost the support, not only of Canadians, who overwhelmingly want to fire him, but of his own party. In fact, the Liberal leader in Ontario has said that his carbon tax is wrong. How could she not say that? It will quadruple over the next five years, bringing economic nuclear winter to our country, emptying our shelves of groceries, driving even more people into starvation. The Liberal Premier of Newfoundland has said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s energy cap will kill jobs in that province. Then 20 Liberal MPs want to fire him. However, it has also gone to his own cabinet. Right in the middle of a potential trade dispute with incoming President-elect Trump, we would assume that the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation>, of all ministers, if she were to appear in the New York Times, would be doing so to fight against the tariffs.

              <ParaText id="8767371">The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> is right. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is weak. Is the Prime Minister selfish? Well, what else could we call it? He has treated himself to illegal vacations to private islands, lavished himself with constant gifts and benefits, shut down Parliament numerous times to cover up scandals, refused to allow Canadians to have accountability for the missing $400 million in the green slush fund scandal, and protected his own trust fund from the tax increases he has imposed on everyone else. One can only think that this is selfish. Most of all, he stays in power after seeing the devastating consequences this is having on the lives of everyday Canadians. That is nothing if not selfish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767372">Then, we can move on to the charge the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> makes that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is attacking the rights of workers. Of this, there is no doubt. We have seen the leader of the NDP. He has gone to rallies at places where courageous workers are striking to recuperate many of the lost wages that have resulted from government-induced inflation. We know we had more strikes last year than in any year since 1983. That is a 40-year high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767373"> We have Canada Post workers on strike. That strike now is lasting a long time and doing incredible damage to small businesses. Hopefully, it will come to an end soon. The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> showed up at these strikes and said, “If there is any vote in Parliament that in any way impacts your rights, we are going to vote no.... Whether that vote is a confidence vote or not, whether it triggers an election or not, I'm telling the Prime Minister and the Liberals right now, ‘You're never going to count on us if you're going to take away the rights of workers. Never’”. What a powerful and absolutely categorical statement that was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767374"> Therefore, surely, the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> will vote on this motion, keeping his word to those workers, or was he looking them straight in the eye and telling them a plain falsehood? Will he go back to them after this vote and tell them that, when it came down to putting his vote where his words were, he just did not have the courage, that he was under too much pressure, that the fear of losing an election and facing the music, for his own record was too much for him, and therefore, he backed down and turned his back on those workers and left them out in the cold? Is that what he is going to tell those union workers? If so, how would they ever believe anything he says to them again? The answer is that they, of course, could not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767375">However, if the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> does decide to vote against his own words, it would mean two things. One, it would mean that he does not want to take responsibility for his own record and that he does not want voters to have the ability to judge his record and his plans because he fears that they would render a verdict that is not in his favour. Two, it would reveal that, in the next election, there are not five or four parties running. There would be two parties running. There would be the NDP-Bloc-Liberal coalition, which taxes people's food, punishes their work, doubles their housing cost and unleashes crime and chaos in their community, and there would be the common-sense Conservatives, who would axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. That is the choice. It is a binary choice. If they vote for the NDP, they would get the Liberals. If they vote for the Liberals, they would get the NDP. If they vote for the Bloc, they would get both the NDP and the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767376"> If they are among the grand majority of Canadians who are unsatisfied with the downward spiral of our country, with broken borders, broken immigration system and broken economy, and if they want to bring home Canada's promise again and restore a country where hard work earns a powerful paycheque and pensions that buy affordable food and homes in safe neighbourhoods, where anyone from anywhere can do anything in the freest nation on earth, in Canada, then let us bring it home. </ParaText>

I am sorry for the noise on this side of the House, but we are fired up for a carbon tax election, which the NDP has the opportunity to allow for today. We are going to, on the floor here now, debate to call the NDP out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767398">The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> is so mad that he has had enough. Let us recall again what he has said in just the past few months alone. He said that he had ripped up his coalition agreement with the Liberals. He said that he was fed up. He said that “the Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people”. He also said, “The Liberal government will always cave to corporate greed, and always step in to make sure the unions have no power.” That was in response to the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="310517" Type="4">labour minister's</Affiliation> referral to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which ordered the workers of Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, in ILWU 514, to resume their duties, violating their right to strike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767399"> The NDP leader talks a tough game. At press conferences, on Twitter, on X, on Facebook, on social media and in question period, he pretends to be outraged. We are going to test that outrage. If he has truly had enough, it is time to vote non-confidence. We are saying that the House and the Conservatives simply agree with the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation>. We are fed up with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We are fed up with this NDP-Liberal government. Enough is enough. He must back his words up with action and vote to have non-confidence in the government. It is time for a carbon tax election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767400">The question is, will the NDP finally do that? I have a feeling, from what we have heard in the last couple of days, that the NDP will not do that. Its members claim that, for all the wonderful things they are getting done for Canadians, they just need more time. They need more runway to prop the Liberals up. The coalition agreement was not ripped up. After that little stunt and photo op, the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> taped it back together piece by piece and handed it right back to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The sellout leader of the NDP has done it time and time again, even this week when we found the NDP's own words put into a motion. There is all that tough talk, but they are going to prop the Prime Minister up again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767401">Let me make it very clear. It is not because the NDP is getting things done for Canadians. It is because of the record of what NDP members have done, the true record, which Canadians know they are complicit in, over the last miserable few years that millions of Canadians have faced. Let us think about it. There are two million visits to food banks in Canada per month in this country. The Feed Ontario report came out, and one million Ontarians are now using a food bank in this country. The Daily Bread Food Bank in Toronto says that 10%, one in every 10 Torontonians, are using a food bank. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767402">The NDP members sit here and say that they support workers and that they have their backs, but their record is a doubling of housing costs, food inflation rising faster than we have seen in decades and a carbon tax that goes up and up, which will be quadrupled. There are all of these stats, and we are seeing workers hurting more than ever before, in my lifetime and beyond. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767403">Of the food bank users, 18% are workers. They are working, but they cannot afford to make ends meet. Workers cannot afford their mortgages or their rent, which have doubled under the watch of the NDP-Liberals. We can also look at crime, with increasing gun violence and an over 100% increase in gun and gang violence in this country. After nine years, auto theft is through the roof under their watch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767404">Time and time again, when we look at every part of their record, it is not delivering for people. It is hurting people. This is the hypocrisy of what NDP members are doing here. They are putting their own words into action. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767405">If the New Democrats are so outraged at how bad the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is and all the things that are happening in this country, if they are upset about the labour rights of unionized workers to be able to strike, if they truly meant what they said outside this chamber and if they truly meant what they said during question period and debates, when the question gets called and we have to stand, they would easily say what millions of Canadians want them to finally say, that they do not have confidence in the Prime Minister, and then they would vote non-confidence and call a carbon tax election, but they will not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767406">Here is the thing: In a carbon tax election, let us just think about the NDP and where its members are. I think I have lost track of the numbers. I think 28, the last time I heard, is the number of times the NDP voted with the Liberals to prop them up in confidence votes, budgets, estimates and everything else in between. Every single time, those plans supported the carbon tax and supported the plan, along with the Bloc Québécois, to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767407">Funnily, around the end of summer a by-election came in an NDP riding in Winnipeg. All of a sudden I think the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> was hearing at the doors with his candidate about just how unpopular the NDP has become by propping this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> up and by quadrupling the carbon tax. The NDP leader came out and said that the New Democrats no longer supported the carbon tax and they supported something else. He did not say what that was. With the by-elections over, the NDP eked through, its margin shrunk drastically, no sooner did the NDP leader flip-flop on the carbon tax. He flip-flopped on his flip-flop now, and he is voting again with the Prime Minister and the Liberals to prop them up, prop the carbon tax up and prop up the quadrupling of the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767408"> The NDP is in political wilderness right now. Its members said they did not support the carbon tax after they supported the carbon tax. Now they are back to supporting it by propping the Liberals up, but they will not say what their plan is. It is like being in the political wilderness, and the only time they come out of the forest is to vote to prop the Liberals up, and then they run back in again. That is exactly what they have been doing for years. They do not want to have an election because they know that they are on the wrong side of Canadians. There are two choices; there are not five or six different options in the next election. The Liberals, the NDP, the Bloc and the Green Party think the carbon tax is doing wonders. They think when we tax a farmer who grows the food, we tax the trucker who ships the food and we tax the stores that sell the food with the carbon tax, nothing contributes to inflation, and it all is just made up in Canadians' heads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767409"> Canadians know better, and that is why members are desperately avoiding a carbon tax election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767410"> It is the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation>'s record on labour that is absolutely hypocritical, time and time again. I want to read a quote from just about one month ago. He said, “If there is ever any vote in Parliament that in any way impacts your rights”, speaking to union members on November 12 last month, “We're going to vote no. I can tell you right now we'll vote no. Whether that vote is a confidence vote or not, whether that triggers an election or not, I'm telling [the Prime Minister] and the Liberals right now, you're never going to count on us if you're going to take away the rights of workers. Never.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767411"> He said that last month. Our motion calls that out today. It is not a game to vote for non-confidence, to have an election and to say “enough” of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. What is political games is the New Democrats voting against their own words and not matching their actions with the rhetoric they have used for the last while.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767412">I want to wrap up today, and I want to say to Canadians in my part of eastern Ontario and across this country, that things are not good right now. The stats are difficult to hear. We have to spend a lot of time talking about doubling of housing prices, food inflation, food bank use and drug overdose deaths, but I want to provide a message of hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767413"> It was not this bad before the NDP and Liberals came in, and it will not be that bad after we give them the boot. Today, in this motion, it is not just about the NDP; it is about the 30-something-year-old who is stuck in their parents' basement. We are going to build new homes by axing the GST on new home sales under $1 million. Some 47,000 Canadians have lost their lives to drug overdoses. We offer treatment and recovery, not the legalization of hard drugs. We are going to restore the Canada we know and love. It is time for the NDP members to get with the program, call an election and back up their words. Let us let Canadians finally have their say.</ParaText>

There are two possible explanations why senators have failed to complete their review of a one-clause bill after 18 months: either they are due for retirement or they are thumbing their noses at us. By “us”, I am not just referring to the parties in the House. They are also thumbing their noses at the supply-managed farmers of Quebec and Canada and the 90,000 Quebec jobs that depend on them. These people deserve some reassurance before the holiday season. </ParaText>

I am going to quote a few things here. The Conservative leader said union contracts that pay workers a decent wage result in a pointless, unnecessary inflation of costs, and that non-union firms with lower wages are good for competition. He also said he simply cannot comprehend that union firms can, in fact, be competitive with non-union ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767731">That is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> prancing around talking about workers in the House. He is determined to deny them their historic, decades-long, hard-fought rights. The Government of Canada is committed to promoting safe, healthy, fair and inclusive working conditions. As of December 15, 2023, federally regulated employers are required to provide sanitary products to all female employees in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767732">For years, replacement workers have been a distraction to the collective bargaining process, and those days are coming to an end. That is because on June 20, Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Canada Industrial Relations Board Regulations, 2012</Document>, received royal assent. When it comes into force on June 20, 2025, it will ban replacement workers in federally regulated sectors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767733">Dealing with pregnancy loss can be very difficult. That is why the government instituted a new leave for pregnancy loss for employees in federally regulated private sectors. This leave will help support them during this difficult time. Adoptive parents and parents of children conceived through surrogacy need time to welcome their children home. That is why we have also instituted a new 16-week leave to support adoptive parents and parents of children conceived through surrogacy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767734">Technology is changing rapidly, and with it, so will the workforce. Increased availability of mobile technologies led to 20% of Canadians primarily working from home in 2023. In 2016, it was only 7%. However, remote workers are often required to be constantly available, which can lead to stress and burnout, ultimately impacting their mental health. We passed legislation to bring a right to disconnect into this new world of work. This measure will help restore the balance for nearly 500,000 federally regulated employees.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8767756">Mr. Speaker, today, we are debating a confidence motion in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government. I think this gives members of Parliament a great opportunity to lay out a variety of issues, not only of the government but also the Conservatives, who are bringing this motion. It gives an opportunity to examine and look under the hood of where that party stands on a number of issues, including some that are just simply not clear yet. I look forward to using the next 10 minutes to go through different things in terms of how I view the government. I sit on this side of the House, the government caucus. I do not sit in the Privy Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767757">I will talk about where I see things that the government has done well and things that I think we need to do better on. I will also compare and contrast this with where the Conservative Party is today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767758">I want to start with the economy. Yes, there are challenges around affordability. We have heard comments in the House. I have had conversations with my own constituents. It might be the same for the Deputy Speaker in <Affiliation DbId="278106" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767759"> It is important to examine the point that this is a global phenomenon. I listened to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278254" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation> the other day. She stood up in the House and suggested that Canada is the only country dealing with affordability challenges, that the government alone is responsible for the difficult periods we have gone through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767760">I will remind her that we went through a global pandemic, and I would invite her to read any newspaper around the world. We will see a lot of the same headlines: There are challenges around housing, the cost of living and affordability. I will remind Canadians at home that, as we have gone through a difficult period, thankfully, the government has been here to support Canadians along the way. Interest rates are back down within the target range of 2%. The hope is that we can see further Bank of Canada interest rate cuts, overnight lending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767761">It is important, when the Conservative Party stands up, to try to keep some element of credibility. When they talk about these issues, there is a level of nuance that exists. I want to highlight a few statistics for people at home. We have had the second-best cumulative economic growth in the G7 since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767762">When the Conservatives get up and suggest that the country is broken, that nothing good has happened, they should be a little bit more pointed in their attack about where the government can do better and also recognize that there has been success. That is the second best economic growth in the G7. Many people at home may not know that; if they listen solely to what they may hear from the opposition benches, I do not think it is reflective of where we are at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767763">We have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. Of course, that is an amount of debt as a proportion and size of the economy, which has been a really important target for the government to maintain. We have a AAA credit rating. We are one of the only advanced economies and countries in the world that have a AAA credit rating. We have seen the highest wage growth in the G7 since 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767764">I have said this before. I know that this does not mean that every Canadian who is sitting at home right now is necessarily feeling good about their circumstances. There are challenges. However, it is important, when we are in this place, to show a level of balance and reasonableness. If we are going to do that, we have to be able to highlight some of the successes the country has had and areas in which every parliamentarian, regardless of where they sit in this place, wants to continue to push government. That is our job as parliamentarians: to continue to push for better for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767765">I also want to highlight the fact that we often hear from the opposition benches about how, again, nothing good is happening in the country. However, they never talk about the fact that we had the third-highest amount of foreign direct investment in the world, not on a per capita basis, just in the world, in 2023. Those are really important numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767766">We have had productivity challenges over multiple governments for the last number of decades. The government has recognized that, and I think that it needs to continue to be stringent and focused on that question about what we can do to increase innovation and productivity in this country. I think we need to be focused on reducing regulatory barriers and red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767767">We have a massive natural resource benefit in this country. We have to make sure that we are balancing, of course, environmental outcomes, indigenous participation and engagement on these issues. At the same time, we need to build big projects that get things done in this country. I think the government has made some strides in this area, but I would humbly suggest we need to do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767768">When we look at the overall economic realities, I would suggest that the government has had a pretty strong success story. When I compare it to the slogan factory on the other side, I am not hearing a credible plan in terms of what the Conservatives would actually do. When we write three or four slogans on the back of a napkin, that does not represent responsible public policy, in terms of what the opposition would do differently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767769">Let us talk about Canada-U.S. relations. This issue is extremely important; Mr. Trump returns to the Oval Office in January, and his inauguration is coming up. This poses challenges for Canada and other western liberal democracies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767770"> The president-elect has talked about imposing a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada. I think that would be bad economic policy for the United States and, of course, it would have impacts on the Canadian economy. However, we have to examine who is the best to lead that relationship. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has an existing relationship with Donald Trump. The current government was there during the renegotiation of CUSMA to make sure that we worked alongside our American partners and Mexican authorities and that we protected Canadian interests at the same time. The government did extraordinarily well in the 42nd Parliament during that period. Last week, the Prime Minister went to Florida; he was the first G7 leader to sit down with Donald Trump following his election victory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767771">I want to compare that to what I have seen in the House of Commons. The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has said such things as that we have to put Canada first. I do not know what the heck that means, but it sounds isolationist. This country that exports many products around the world, whether in agriculture, forestry, critical minerals or energy; I do not think the idea of looking inward is good for Canada. That is the Conservatives' play, but they have not articulated what the heck it means. The Leader of the Opposition stands up and suggests that now we have to kill carbon pricing because Donald Trump is in. That is not a responsible element.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767772">I look at what the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> has said, and he suggested striking some type of war cabinet. No, lighting our hair on fire is not the way to go here; we need to have a level of statesmanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767773">I have not agreed with everything the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done, and we have had some vehement disagreements. However, I do think that he has looked far more like a statesman than the other two leaders of the major parties in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767774">On foreign affairs, it is outrageous that the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has not committed the Conservative Party to a 2% defence target. The Conservatives love to beat their chest about the work they would do for the Canadian military, yet they fail to remind Canadians that, when they left office, defence spending was actually below 1%. I think this government has taken a little bit too long to get there, but we have gotten to the 2% commitment by 2032. Looking at the tabled estimates, we can see that defence spending is increasing this year and will continue to increase over the next number of years. I find it extremely irresponsible that, as a government-in-waiting, the Conservatives will not commit to 2%. When will they formally commit to the 2% GDP target on defence? They owe the answer to Canadians and they owe it sooner rather than later, particularly in the environment we are in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767775">Let us talk about security clearance. We can think about this for a moment: Earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, referenced in his question that there are allegations that agents of the Indian government were involved in the Conservative leadership campaign, particularly to dispel and hurt Patrick Brown, who was running against the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. The member for Carleton is the only leader of all the major parties to not get his security clearance. Why would he not do this? This man wants to be the prime minister of the country, and he refuses to go through the security clearance process to be adequately advised and informed by national security advisers on what is happening on foreign interference. That is not responsible leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767776">If I am presented with a question here about whether I have confidence in the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, I would ask this: Do I agree with everything that has happened? No, but I compare it to what the alternative would be. How could I ever vote for this confidence motion in good faith when the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, who wants to be the Prime Minister, has not even gone through the vetting process?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767777">The last piece I want to talk about is on affordability and social programs. Whether it is on dental, pharmacare or school food programs that really matter in my neck of the woods in Nova Scotia, the Conservatives vote against it. For seniors, they voted against increases to OAS, moved the eligible age for benefits from 65 to 67 and voted against increases to the guaranteed income supplement. On housing, they are taking away the money that we are giving to try to build more housing. We had the largest number of houses built in Nova Scotia in 2023. We still have to clean up that issue, but it is well on its way; however, the Conservatives want to take away the funding that actually builds the homes that we need to house Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767778">For all those reasons and more, this is why I will not be voting in favour of this motion.</ParaText>

I noticed that, since 2015, when the government came in, this country's performance has shown less than half of the cumulative GDP growth that the United States has accomplished. That is the main metric we have to look at, not European countries that have gone through a major problem with energy provisions, particularly since the war. Quite frankly, they are underperforming.

              <ParaText id="8767792">Mr. Speaker, I am happy. I almost feel like I am among family. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> is here. My friend from <Affiliation DbId="278521" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation> is here, also. It is like being back in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. I feel good and confident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767793">As far as the motion of non-confidence in the government is concerned, I think that the Bloc Québécois's course of action is fairly clear and understandable: We say what we do and we do what we say. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767794">On day one, going back to September 25, the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the Bloc Québécois gave the government an ultimatum. Our goal was to protect seniors and our farmers. We gave the government a chance to come to terms with us and ensure that its minority government would hold. Unfortunately, when it came to Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> on increasing pensions and Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document> on supply management, the government refused to listen. Instead, it proposed measures that seem to have come back to bite it today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767795">On the subject of the $250 that excluded seniors in particular, people would not believe how much feedback I have gotten on that and how much it increased cynicism. Never in my time in the House, since 2019, have I heard so much about an issue. The same thing goes for the GST. I have heard from many business owners who said the measure was crazy and that they do not have the resources to change their entire system. This is what the government wanted to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767796">It was clear from that moment on that if the Bloc Québécois had the opportunity, we would bring down the government. It should come as no surprise to the House that the Bloc Québécois will be voting in favour of the motion before us. Why? It is because I truly believe that the government cannot be trusted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767797">That being said, I am being a bit mischievous. The question of whether we can trust the government is interesting, but there is another one too, namely whether we can trust the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767798">I thought why not give the leader of the official opposition a dose of the same medicine he gave the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the NDP. In a past life, I taught at a university. I quite liked discourse analysis. Discourse analysis is kind of what we are seeing in the motion. What the Conservative Party is doing is taking the NDP leader's statements to show that if he wants to be consistent with his statements then he should bring down the government. The Conservatives are absolutely right about that. If the NDP wants to be consistent with the statements it makes, it should bring down the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767799">Another rather interesting issue is whether we can have confidence in the Leader of the Opposition if we analyze his discourse and statements. That is what we are going to try to do. I am going to use a lot of quotes. The Conservatives should be happy about that since the content comes entirely from their leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767800">The first reason that was widely put forward by the leader of the official opposition for bringing down the government is the infamous issue of wokeism. I will give some examples. My colleagues will see where I am going with this.</ParaText>

              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767806">I would like to read another quote by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> from the day before, November 25. He said, “Mr. Speaker, the lawless hate riot that we saw on the streets of Montreal is what happens after nine years of a woke Prime Minister pushing radical, woke identity politics, dividing people by race, gender, vaccine status, religion and more.” We know that the Leader of the Opposition has a penchant for conspiracy theories. That is another quote that shows the danger facing Canadian society, the woke danger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767807">I have another quote from last year. He said, “We will also bring back freedom. I know that freedom is a foundational principle of our country. The federal government wants to censor the Internet. The CRTC, a woke agency, wants to impose its values on Quebeckers.” In the same quote, the leader of the official opposition talks about the “Minister of Canadian Heritage, and...other woke bureaucrats here in Ottawa, who will control what Quebeckers can see and say on the Internet.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767808">I am going to provide a summary of the woke threat. When the leader of the official opposition talks about radical identity politics, when he talks about politics that divide people by race and religion and when he talks about politics that seek to impose values on Quebeckers, the following question comes to mind: Who is doing that in Quebec? Who is acting woke in Quebec? The answer is fairly simple. Who represents that position? Guess what? Usually, it is the people who are against Bill 21, the state secularism law. Bill 21 governs religion in the public sphere. In Quebec, when we talk about someone who is woke, we are talking about people who are against Bill 21 and who have a view of minorities that goes against the Quebec national minority. We have a definition of what wokeism is in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767809">Let us now try to look at what the leader of the official opposition is telling us about Bill 21. On numerous occasions, he said, and I quote, “I'm against Bill 21.” He has also said, “If I were a Quebec politician, I would vote against it in the legislature. If anyone proposed it federally, and I do not see that happening, I would vote against it. I believe in religious freedom.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767810">That is the leader of the official opposition's interpretation. This woke culture is one of his main reasons for wanting to bring down the government. I would like to point out that, here in Ottawa, the Leader of the Opposition is against woke culture, but when he gets to Quebec, he himself is actually woke. The leader of the official opposition, from Quebec's perspective, is woke. That somewhat conflicting piece of information is pretty important. If Quebeckers want to make up their minds about the Conservative Party's policy directions, I would suggest that is a bit more complex than the slogans we hear day after day in the House. At the very least, perhaps the leader of the official opposition could explain what makes those who are woke in Canada different from those who are woke in Quebec. Is this the solitude of the two wokes? Possibly, but it is clear that the leader of the official opposition's intentions are not in line with Quebec's aspirations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767811">Another crucial topic for the leader of the official opposition is inflation and its repercussions. The leader of the official opposition has often talked to us about the many ways inflation is negatively impacting Canadian society, which is broken. The leader of the official opposition often tells us that Canada is broken and the budget needs to be fixed. Canada is broken, and his solution is to fix the budget. By way of illustration, I would refer members to a misleading ad that the leader of the official opposition aired some time ago. It featured a Quebec family talking about how they could not pay their mortgage. Later, it emerged that this was not the case. It was a generic image, and the family was very angry with the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767812">This family said that they absolutely were paying their mortgage but were being portrayed in the media like a family of idiots, all because the Conservative party <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> had decided to make them characters in his fantasy world. People will also remember the infamous video about the leader of the official opposition's idealized vision of Canada the day he appeared in a white cowboy hat. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> thought he was the singer from the Village People. The member for Lac-Saint-Jean is always ready to dance. His jaw soon dropped when he realized it was actually the leader of the official opposition, especially after all the over-the-top statements that came next. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767813">What struck me the most was how the leader of the official opposition used the issue of medical assistance in dying. The leader of the official opposition linked medical assistance in dying to inflation, the recession, and the financial struggles that some people are facing. On June 7, 2023, the Leader of the Opposition said, “Those going to The Mississauga Food Bank and seeking help with medical assistance in dying, not because they are sick but because they are hungry, have never had it so good”. According to the leader of the official opposition, some people in Mississauga were going to food banks and were so hungry that they were requesting medical assistance in dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767814"> On May 15, 2023, he said, “One in five is skipping meals because they cannot afford the inflationary carbon tax on food.” Now there is another link. I will come back to that later, because the carbon tax is another pet project of the Leader of the Opposition. He went on to say, “1.5 million are eating at food banks, and some are asking for help with medical assistance in dying because they cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves.” Personally, I have yet to meet anyone who has requested medical assistance in dying because they were hungry. Maybe one day, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> will introduce us to those people. I asked him a question earlier after his speech, and he explained that it was meant to be an ode, that it was his version of poetry. I am very familiar with Miron, and I understand many poets, but I still do not understand the poetry of the leader of the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767815">Lastly, we have scurvy. After medical assistance in dying came the resurgence in scurvy. In February 2024, the leader of the official opposition said, “There is the re-emergence of illnesses that were long ago banished, like scurvy, because people have become malnourished under the Prime Minister's impoverishing policies.” If members are following what I am saying, it seems we have people who are asking for medical assistance in dying because there is nothing left to eat. Others are not asking for medical assistance in dying, but they have scurvy because they do not have anything to eat. If Canada is not broken, then one has to wonder what is happening. We are truly at a crossroads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767816">It does not stop there. I have often criticized the leader of the official opposition by saying that he is not presenting any solutions, but he is. I want to tell the House about the leader of the official opposition's solutions to inflation. I found some quotes. I looked long and hard and I managed to find some quotes showing that the leader of the official opposition does have some solutions. Here is one of his first solutions to inflation: Canadians can embrace cryptocurrency to “opt out of inflation”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767817">It is a pretty interesting sleight of hand. The Leader of the Opposition is always telling us to take control of money away from bankers and politicians and give it to the people. Here is another quote from the Leader of the Opposition: “We're going to give people the freedom, the FREE-DOM to choose their own currency without the Bank of Canada stepping in to print money and devalue the currency.” Finally, the Leader of the Opposition tells us that to stop inflation, to stop people from asking for medical assistance in dying and to stop people from getting scurvy, the solution is Bitcoin. It is pretty ingenious. Perhaps Bitcoin is the solution for domestic policy, but the other solution proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is to get out of Davos.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767818">Apparently Canada is at a disadvantage because of a global conspiracy that is partly responsible for inflation. In a fundraising email, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> said, “It's far past time we rejected the globalist Davos elites and bring home the common sense of the common people.” He is not a globalist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767819">Here is another quote from the leader of the official opposition. During a speech he gave in British Columbia in July 2023, he said, “There will be no mandatory digital ID in this country, and I will ban all of my ministers and top government officials from any involvement in the World Economic Forum”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767820">That is one way to square a circle. Conspiracy theories say there will be digital ID. The people at the World Economic Forum are controlling whole governments like puppets. The leader of the official opposition has a solution: Bitcoin. He will also terminate the government's involvement in the World Economic Forum. There are solutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767821">The famous carbon tax is another key element to understanding what is driving the leader of the official opposition to defeat the government. Every member ends their intervention by saying that we need a carbon tax election. I will note that the carbon tax does not apply in Quebec. They may have a theme specific to Quebec, but clearly the leader of the official opposition is not addressing Quebeckers when he talks about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767822">I will provide an example that is just fantastic. On September 25, the leader of the official opposition said, “Let us talk about education. The carbon tax will cost Saskatchewan schools $204 million. That is the equivalent of approximately 2,000 teachers losing their job, all to pay tax to heat schools in cold Saskatchewan winters.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767823">The leader of the official opposition often does that. He talked to us about a nurse who lost her job because of the cost to heat the hospital. He also talked about teachers losing their job because of the cost to heat the schools. The worst example was on September 24. The leader of the official opposition had a stroke of genius when he talked about “nuclear winter”. That is incredibly dangerous. The leader of the official opposition said, “What he actually wants to do is quadruple the carbon tax, which will grind our economy to a halt. It will be a nuclear winter for our economy.” There will be no more heating. If we listen to the Liberals, there might be no more teeth because there will be no more dental insurance. It is a mess. Canada is truly broken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767824">When the leader of the official opposition gave his speech today, I told myself that he had the solution. The leader of the official opposition has the solution, because he has told us before about the famous electrician who captures lightning and sends it through a copper wire to light up the rooms we are in. I think that this electrician could also heat schools and hospitals. I am sure he could do that. That is the answer. All we have to do is find more of these electricians who capture lightning. They will be able to heat our schools and hospitals. It will be great. That is once again a great solution from the leader of the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767825">Of course, I will skip over those things that pertain specifically to oil. I will, perhaps, digress briefly to talk about law and order, something that the opposition leader talks a lot about. However, there is one thing that he seems to gloss over. During the trucker protests, the opposition leader said, “I was at an overpass as the truckers went by, and what I saw were cheerful, patriotic and optimistic Canadians who want their freedom back and want their livelihoods back.” I think that goes well with his theme of law and order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767826">I will end my speech by saying that, after two years of this Leader of the Opposition, he is not worth the cost or the pollution. The Bloc Québécois, a party of staunch sovereignists, will eliminate funding for oil companies, increase pensions for people over the age of 65, stop hate speech and defend supply management. When is the election?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767856">Mr. Speaker, I always say what a great honour it is to rise in a House such as this, chosen by the people of Timmins—James Bay, but I have to say that I am less and less proud every time I am asked to stand up because I do not know how to tell young Canadians to believe in democracy when they watch this dismal gong show day after day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767857">We are in a crisis of democracy around the world, a moment when Canada, which was always a land known for its tolerance and fairness, sits in this dysfunctional, broken crisis. It is not a natural break. I mean, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> who lives in the Stornoway mansion says everything is broken. He is making it broken. We have had two months of a Parliament unable to work at a time when we are facing the threats coming in from Donald Trump, when we are facing the Russians moving to hypersonic missiles, when we are facing a larger crisis and Canada needs to be seen. Instead, we are sitting here playing these really stupid, dismal games. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767858">Having been here 20 years, I do not want to say there have been glory days when we were all smarter, we were all wiser and we all rose to the highest standards. In fact, when I first got elected, it really reminded me of being in a new school in grade 9, walking into the cafeteria and having people throw food at me. However, there was a difference. The difference was that, for all the silliness and the mediocrity, we knew that we were there at the end of the day for something bigger than us and our parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767859"> Just the other night, I was walking down Elgin Street, and a former Conservative cabinet minister, David MacDonald, stopped me on the street. What a gentleman. He was in the Joe Clark government. He talked to me about his concern about Canada's democracy at this time. He talked about those days. Those were serious days, the days of Reaganomics and the days of mass unemployment. We talk about affordability issues now, but at that time interest rates were hitting 18% and 21% and people were losing their homes across Canada. We never saw the darkness that is being generated now. He talked to me about being in the Joe Clark cabinet, finding people on the Liberal side to work with and calling Ed Broadbent to work with him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767860">However, that is not what we have now. Instead of the grade 9 cafeteria, this is kind of like <I>Beavis and Butt-Head</I> go to <I>Lord of the Flies</I>. I say that because for two months we have sat and watched these silly, stupid games. It is like today the Conservatives got this idea, “You know what we're going to do? We're going to get the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the NDP's words that he'll defend workers and we'll use that. Ha ha. Then we'll force him to have a Christmas election.” They pat themselves on the back because they think that is actually offering something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767861">This has been two solid months of nothing getting done. I have been partisan my whole life. I have been in opposition my whole life, but I know there are moments when I put that aside for the good of the country. We need the fall economic statement to move forward. We have first nation issues and monies that are being held up so they can play their gong show about Canada being broken. I know multiple copper projects that are not going to go ahead, and that investment is going to go to Malaysia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767862">Do members know what the happy sock puppets tell people? “Don't worry. When our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> gets in, we'll fix it.” The Conservatives want to break it. They want to burn the house to the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767863"> I said that because, last night, Amnesty International released a damning report on the genocide that is happening in Gaza. These are the big issues that we are facing. The Amnesty International report comes on the findings of the UN that hospital workers are being targeted and murdered deliberately, which are crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court has sent forward indictments, both against Hamas and against the key leaders in the Israeli government, for crimes against humanity. Canada was one of the founding partners in the creation of the International Criminal Court. Yes, we might have been small, but we stepped up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767864">During the apartheid regime and the fight to bring down that oppressive, hateful regime, Canada played a part. Yes, a former Conservative prime minister stood up for the notion of international human rights and law. He did that. In Rwanda, in the face of a horrific genocide, there were Canadians on the front lines. When they were abandoned by the UN, abandoned by Europe, it was Canadians who were there to stop the genocide. In Srebrenica and Yugoslavia, Canada played a role.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767865">When Canada was confronted with the International Criminal Court finding against Vladimir Putin, which was a very important finding, the Conservatives came in and voted multiple times against support for Ukraine, to burn the house to the ground. When the International Criminal Court found that a genocide was being committed against people, what did the member who lives in the 19-room mansion in Stornoway say? He said it was hare-brained and woke. This man is not fit for public office. I have never said that about anyone who has ever walked into this House, but a man who looks at the role that Canada played at the International Criminal Court and says it is hare-brained and woke is not fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767866">I say this given the threats posed by Donald Trump. They are threats against the basic democratic order, because if the Americans lose the democratic order, we all lose the democratic order. When we see that he has posted a Putin troll to be in charge of intelligence, and when he is posting a man for the head of the FBI to target his political enemies, that is the undermining of democracy. His attack on Canada, a 25% tariff, threatens serious economic harm. We are going to have to stand up as a nation. We are going to have to stand up with some unity. We are going to have to stand up for Canadian values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767867">We cannot demonize the immigrant and migrant people who are coming here. We cannot use them to appease Donald Trump. Donald Trump is talking about fentanyl. He is accusing Canada of being the supply chain for the fentanyl crisis in America, when we know that it was OxyContin from the United States that created the crisis here and the huge death rates that we are still suffering. The fentanyl crisis is an unprecedented crisis. What does the guy who lives in a 19-room mansion say? He claims that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> legalized fentanyl and put it on the streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767868">We have rules about decorum. I cannot call that man a liar. That would not be civic, but he can use the deaths of thousands of people. He does that normally, but it is different when Donald Trump is accusing Canada of being a fentanyl chain into the United States and the impact will be 25% tariffs. That is when we put aside our pitiful partisan games and say there is a bigger issue here, but no, because he will burn our country to the ground to score a point. We can bet that Fox News will be having him on, and we can bet that the Conservative sock puppets who obediently repeat these falsehoods will be quoted again and again to justify the 25% tariffs that will cause economic havoc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767869">We have been through much worse times economically, but there was always a notion that we would come together on the key elements across party lines. I disagree with the government on a thousand things, and I will fight it on a thousand things, but I will put the security of my nation first. That was why I was elected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767870">This “burn our country to the ground” approach that he is using with Donald Trump is the way he went after doctors in the opioid crisis. He named doctors who then got death threats, doctors who are on the front lines. What has this guy ever been on the front line of, other than getting free food in the House of Commons' lobby? I have seen him in the front line there, but he attacked medical doctors and they got death threats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767871">Then he attacked independent journalism. Of course, he attacks CBC. He attacked CTV. He had workers fired for doing their jobs. He attacked Rachel Gilmore from Global, who was fired, and she received death threats. He thinks the independent media is a threat to the falsehoods of a party that lives on bumper sticker slogans. If someone runs an entire party based on dumbed-down slogans that all its members happily repeat, they cannot have an independent media, so they attacked CTV. He attacked CBC. He attacked Canadian Press. He attacked the Toronto Star. He is attacking the fundamental checks and balances in our system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767872"> However, that is not all. Last week, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> went after municipal councillors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767873">It is really hard right now to encourage people to participate in democracy, and if we do not encourage good people to participate in democracy, democracy does not exist. I have never, ever seen a situation where some guy, whose only job, apparently, was at a Dairy Queen when he was young and then as a political attack dog for the rest of his life, goes out and states that Canada's municipal councillors are greedy. He said they were BS'ing the public, that they were swimming in money and that he would cut the taps off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767874">I know municipal councillors who get death threats for doing their job. We know that the mayor of Gatineau just stepped down. She did not want to do it anymore. I have talked to councillors who say it is not worth representing people. If those people do not step up, we do not have a democracy. However, the member for Stornoway decided that it was Canada's mayors and councillors who are now his new enemy because he gets bored with his old enemies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767875"> We cannot run a democracy when one level of government decides that it is going to turn the dogs on another level. We can disagree, but someone would have to be some kind of special to be able to blame every municipal councillor and every mayor and every community in this country for causing the problem of housing when he has got no plan for housing. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s plan for housing was to take out Patrick Brown. That was the plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767876">Now, we are seeing from CSIS more and more evidence of the interference that took place. We just learned from Radio-Canada that Patrick Brown's head of the campaign, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, was approached by representatives of the Modi government to pull out support. We know that he got 170,000 memberships in the last 48 hours. I ran for party leader. I know that just is not done. That is something they generate in the backroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767877"> CSIS has been raising question after question regarding how that man got into Stornoway and how the Conservatives took down Erin O'Toole. I had lunch with Erin the other day. He said, “You keep saying nice things about me in the House.” I said, “I know, Erin. Once you are gone, I will be nice to you.” I said, “Erin, you would have been a good prime minister.” Erin is a man of dignity. Erin and I disagree on a lot of things, but Erin served his country and will always serve his country, and he was taken down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767878"> Therefore, we need answers with respect to the interference. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">guy who lives in Stornoway</Affiliation> says people cannot afford to eat and then tells his people to vote against food for children. He is the guy who was supposed to help us in the mental health crisis but told his people to vote against a suicide hotline. He is the man who ran an election on an HST break and then voted against it. Mister axe the tax is more like mister axe the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767879">At Stornoway, there is $170,000 in repairs. It is $190,000 a year and he gets a chef. That is what he lives with, in a 19-room mansion. I guess taking down Erin O'Toole was worth it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767880">Here is my thing: If he really were serious, why do we not forgo the chef? Now, I know “forgo” is a big word for Conservatives. It is kind of an older word, and it might not fit well on a bumper sticker. How about we just say, “Eff the chef”? This is my call to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">member who lives in Stornoway</Affiliation>. If he is serious at all about anything, eff the chef. I would put that on a bumper sticker. Do members not think people would support it? Eff the chef, and then maybe we could forgo the guy who is living off the chef. However, “eff the guy who lives in Stornoway” is too big. I am going to work on it. I will come back next week, and I will have a better one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767881">Anyway, Mr. Speaker, I will be here all week. If you need me for anything, just ask me, but I do want to bring forward an amendment at this time. I will keep talking and someone will get me the amendment. They never let me do amendments. Seriously, in all my time here, have I ever done anything procedural that you can remember, Mr. Speaker?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767882">Anyway, let us just keep going back to the guy who lives in Stornoway. Now, here is another fact: I am not mad at all the Conservatives. I have great respect for some of them. The member for Wellington-Halton Hills, for example, said in The Globe and Mail on October 23 that there is a reason the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> may not get a security clearance, and it is because “security clearances involve a rigorous process that includes...checks on family members, credit and criminal checks and...questions about one's sexual partners or whether they ever used drugs”. I did not say that. A Conservative said that. He said that Conservatives fear that that would be used for politically motivated purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767883">I will end on this: What the heck is in that closet in Stornoway that he is so afraid of that he will not or cannot get a security clearance? We need to know what is in that closet because Canadians are paying the cost of that closet and of the chef who feeds the guy who has stuff hidden in that closet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767884">Here we are for round two. I move that the motion be amended (a) by adding, after the words “right to strike”, the following: “(iv) whereas the NDP leader said the Conservative leader has ‘deep connections to billionaires and CEOs’, (v) whereas the NDP leader said, ‘the Conservative leader voted against giving kids dental care despite having publicly paid dental care for nearly two decades’; (vi) whereas the NDP leader said, ‘the Conservative leader would use his power to cut health care and other services that people rely on’” and (b) by replacing all the words after the words “the House proclaims” with the following: “its disappointment that for decades, the Liberals and Conservatives have stacked the deck for corporate CEOs against working Canadians.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767885">I will be here all week. I am glad that, in the end, the Conservatives showed up. I will send them the YouTube clips.</ParaText>

The NDP leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, said it himself: “I...ripped up the Supply and Confidence Agreement” with the Liberal government. Let us call it what it is: a stunt. It was designed to distract from the fact that the NDP leader and his party have been propping up the government that has been failing for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767920">The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> has been outspoken in opposing actions that weaken unions' power. He has stated unequivocally that if any vote in Parliament impacts workers' rights, the NDP will vote against it regardless of the consequences. However, despite his strong words, his actions have not always matched his words. While the NDP leader has condemned the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for taking away the Teamsters' and ILWU Local 514's right to strike, he has remained largely silent on other issues affecting workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767921">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has launched a brutal assault on workers, hurting their paycheques through inflation, driving up prices with a carbon tax, doubling housing costs, hiking taxes, cancelling major projects that could create union jobs and issuing orders that undermine workers' chances of giving every Canadian a fair shot at a decent life and affording necessities. Despite these actions, the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> has continued to support the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767922">Now the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> faces a crucial choice: Will the NDP continue propping up a government that makes decisions that harm workers, or will it stand by its principles and vote to fix the government? The NDP leader said on November 12 that the Liberals are never going to be able to count on the NDP if the Liberals are going to take away the rights of workers. The time has come for the NDP to act on those words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767923">We are at a crossroads, and it has become clear every day that everything is broken. Seven in ten Canadians now say they feel the same way: that nothing is working anymore. Our economy is stuck and families are getting squeezed at every turn. According to Equifax and TransUnion, consumer credit debt has hit an all-time high, and Canadians are now paying more in taxes than they spend on housing, food and clothing combined. The cost of living has become so unbearable that 26% of Canadians are seriously considering leaving this country because it is simply too expensive to live here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767924">In the last year alone, 1.4 million children were living in poverty, and the number of Canadians turning to food banks has reached staggering levels with record-breaking numbers: over two million visits in a single month. One million people in Ontario alone used food banks last year. For the first time in Canadian history, 80% of Canadians believe home ownership is now reserved for the super-rich, with some families even forced to spend 100% of their income on rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767925">Let us not ignore the reality on our streets. Violent crime is up 50%. Gun violence has more than doubled, and auto theft is rampant. However, instead of fixing these issues, the Liberals and the NDP continue to ignore the rising tide of hardship across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767926">In the middle of all this is the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>. The NDP leader has spent more time posing for cameras than standing up for Canadian families. He promised he would be an opposition voice and an advocate for the working class. Instead he handed over his principles to keep the Liberals in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767927">After his big media stunt, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> still refuses to say whether he will vote to force a carbon tax election at the first chance. He voted to quadruple the carbon tax to $0.61 per litre. It is a plan that will drive Canadians to food banks and grind the economy to a halt, killing hundreds of thousands of jobs. Remember that this is after he promised to be the voice against high taxes and big government.

My private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11540871" Type="4">C-241</Document>, would directly address the struggles of hard-working Canadians, particularly those who are essential to our country, our tradespeople: the welders, electricians, carpenters and plumbers who keep everything running smoothly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767938">Nonetheless, for all their hard work, tradespeople are often left behind, with their contributions barely recognized. These men and women are the backbone of our economy, yet they are often left behind, overlooked and undervalued. These workers are often required to leave their family, travel across the country and sacrifice precious time with their loved ones just to ensure that their kids have access to basic necessities like food and medicine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767939">However, as we see time and time again, New Democrats have quickly aligned themselves with the Liberals, leaving us wondering whether the NDP genuinely stands for working people or whether it is just another party caught up in the political game. By siding with the Liberals, it has allowed the status quo to continue, and working Canadians are the ones paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767940">Therefore, who is truly fighting for hard-working Canadians? The answer is clear. It is not the Liberals and certainly not the NDP. It is the Conservatives who are committed to standing up for people who keep this country running, the workers who deserve more than just empty promises and political games. We can do better for tradespeople and hard-working families across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767941">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> has completely forgotten the working class and the labour movement that once defined his party. He has abandoned hard-working Canadians in favour of a Liberal government that has disregarded their hardships in exchange for political survival. While the government raises taxes, the cost of living has increased dramatically. Housing is out of reach and food prices are still rising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767942">In spite of his pledge to defend workers, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> has safeguarded his personal interests by obtaining a pension at the expense of people who are most in need of assistance. His backing of the Liberal government directly contributes to the escalating cost of living crisis and undercuts workers' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767943">In Windsor-Essex, the housing crisis is out of control. Habitat for Humanity Windsor-Essex has been forced to shift focus as families struggle to afford homes. While it has built or repaired 125 homes over 30 years, the need keeps growing. Families are spending 75% to 95% of their income on rent, far beyond what is affordable. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> continues to prop up the government in its failure to address the crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767944">The NDP-Liberal coalition has only made things worse, with policies that drive up costs for Canadians. It is time to axe the carbon tax, build more affordable homes and bring the cost of living under control. The people of Windsor-Essex and all of Canada deserve better. It is time to stop supporting a government that caters to the wealthy, and to start putting working Canadians first. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> has sold out his own supporters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767945">We need change: Conservatives who are ready to stand up for workers, cut taxes, fix the housing crisis and, finally, give every Canadian a fair shot at a decent life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767946">In closing, I would be remiss not to thank the hard-working men and women in the Windsor-Essex area, such as members of IBEW and of the carpenters' union, ironworkers, and members of LiUNA and Unifor, just to name a few. They build the homes, the infrastructure, the vehicles and the soon-to-be-completed Gordie Howe International Bridge. Their passion and dedication do not go unnoticed and are most appreciated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8767964">Madam Speaker, it is great to hear from my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278526" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation> on all of his great insights, and it is great to see him back in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767965">We are here to debate a motion of non-confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the current government, because the workers of Canada are hurting. Workers and Canadians are struggling. In the words of the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>, “The Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767966"> The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> also said, “The Liberal government will always cave to corporate greed, and always step in to make sure the unions have no power.” We agree, which is why we put forward this motion and why the NDP needs to stop propping up the Liberal government and vote non-confidence with us. That is what workers want. That is what Canadians want. They want a carbon tax election now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767967">We saw in the Statistics Canada report on Friday just how much Canadian workers and Canadians are suffering after nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> backed up by the NDP. StatsCan reported that Canada's GDP per capita has declined for six consecutive quarters. In other words, our standard of living is falling, especially when compared to south of the border. There is now a $33,000 per year difference in income per person between Canada and the U.S., according to the IMF. Add to this the punishing carbon tax in Canada, and those workers' paycheques are stretched even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767968">Food bank use in Canada reached 2 million, and 18% of those are workers. That is shameful. The very inflationary tax policies of the Liberals, which have been supported all the way along by the NDP, have caused this cost of living crisis and are making Canadian workers and Canadians poorer. It is no wonder that in 2023 we saw the highest number of work stoppages and interruptions in Canada since 1983, which is 40 years, because when inflation is running rampant and the cost of living is out of control, workers rightly need more to get by, to support their families. They are fighting for better wages everywhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767969">While statistics paint a damning picture of the economic carnage being inflicted on Canadians by the NDP-Liberal coalition, beyond the statistics are real people, real workers and their stories. I remember speaking to steelworkers on the floor of Stelco last winter. Of course, that is in Hamilton, and Hamiltonians have a reputation for grit, determination and hard work. It is the Hammer, after all, and nowhere is that more evident than on the floor of Stelco.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767970"> These workers work hard day in and day out to produce the steel that is so instrumental to our economy. It is hot, heavy work, but it should also be rewarding work. These are union workers, members of the United Steelworkers. A steelworker named Travis talked to me about how difficult it is as a young person to make ends meet. He has a good union job with good wages and benefits, but inflation, taxes and housing costs are taking an increasingly larger bite out of his paycheque. He also worries that his colleagues who have young families are in an even tougher spot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767971"> Travis was not alone. Others that same day recounted the same story. The cost of living crisis has been a kick in the teeth, and they cannot afford to pay the increases they are seeing in their mortgage renewals, their rent, their groceries, filling up the truck or car to get to work, or heating their home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767972"> Last month, I talked to union workers alongside the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> at the Boilermakers Local 128, as well as UA Local 67, which represents journeymen, pipefitters, plumbers and their apprentices. Their training hall is located in my constituency of Flamborough—Glanbrook. We also talked to LiUNA construction workers and others. These are the workers who build this country and are building our economy. Canada needs more of these skilled workers, but they need a government that has their back, which is why we introduced this motion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767973"> I think about my grandfather, who was a proud union member. My Opa Blok was a carpenter. He came to Canada from the Netherlands in 1949, at the end of the Second World War, in search of a better future for himself and his family. He braved a new land and a new language, and he came a year before bringing the rest of his family. My mother was five when they finally came. Opa worked hard and saved up. As a carpenter, he joined the union, because it offered him good wages and modest benefits at that time for him and his family. He was always a staunch supporter of the unions, because unions built the middle class. Our family is an example of that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8767974">Opa was also a card-carrying member of the NDP for almost 30 years. I wonder what Opa would think today about the NDP under the leadership of the current <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation>. The NDP has unwaveringly supported a Liberal government that has violated workers' rights to strike, that is increasing the cost of living for that middle class. I think it is safe to say the NDP under its current leader is no longer my grandfather's NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767975">My mom was also a union member, for her entire 45-year career as a registered nurse in Hamilton, working at various hospitals. My brothers and I were fortunate to grow up in a middle-class household. While we did not always get everything we wanted, my mom's union job as a nurse and my dad's work in the trades as a bricklayer allowed us the middle-class dream of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767976">I contrast that to the conversations I had on the floor of Stelco that day and in the union halls in the Hamilton area in the time since. The middle-class dream of Canada is slipping away for workers, for people. What is ironic about the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> is that he talks a big game, saying, “the Liberals are too weak”, yet he is the one keeping the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in power. He is the one supporting the very policies that are making life so unaffordable, especially the carbon tax, which the NDP has supported 24 times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767977">When workers, through their unions, demand more to pay their mortgages and their rents, to pay for their groceries and their gas, to sustain that modest middle-class living on their hard work, when they also fight for safety and the gains they have made in safety, as the Teamsters did this summer, the Liberals have shut down their strikes, shut down their job actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767978">While the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> has called this out, that same leader and his caucus voted confidence in the Liberal government twice earlier this fall.

              <ParaText id="8767991">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in the House to talk about SDTC and the green slush fund, because this gives us an opportunity to look at what is happening here in Canada. My friend from <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> talked about the way the government is working, or not working, I should say, or is working in a bad direction. My speech focuses on where the loss of trust is, how we have this loss of trust and why we have this loss of trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767992">Over the last nine years, we see there have been so many things that have made Canadians, who voted for Liberals in 2015, say that they cannot trust the government anymore. The green slush fund is just another example of why Canadians have lost trust and hope. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767993">What is the green slush fund and why was it created in the first place? When we look at Sustainable Development Technology Canada, we have to look at its mandate. Its mandate was to help Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies by delivering critical funding support at every stage of the journey. This sounds great. It is something we need, and for decades we did have it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767994">In the last six years, there was $836 million spent on green start-ups. I am not against any of that, but the issue I have here is there were also 186 projects that had conflicts of interest. When I talk about loss of trust in the government, that is where I really want to focus. We, as a party and as opposition, have been asking for these documents for months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767995">Last December, in 2023, when the whistle-blowers came forward and talked about what was happening and how this money was being distributed, things started happening. We saw a freezing of the slush fund. The money is not available, which, in turn, is causing a lot of problems for people who are actually running legitimate businesses, who are not able to get the payments they expected and are not able to get the assistance from the government that would help them. However, because the government was allowing people to be eligible for truly ineligible reasons, those payments did not move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767996">We can talk about the conflicts of interest. We can talk about whether it was the CEO or board chair, but we can look at the conflicts of interest that were occurring in SDTC as well. This all goes back to looking at accountability and transparency, which is something we have seen very little of over the last nine years. For a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who was going to have sunshine and said that everything was going to be fine and that they were going to be clear, accountable and transparent, which is what he was running on in 2015, that is exactly the opposite of what we see here in 2024. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767997">The loss of hope is one of the biggest challenges we are having here in Canada. When I had this opportunity to speak on this motion, I spoke to my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278561" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation>. He was talking about what we can talk about, because he was looking at the censorship issues here in Canada. There are Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> and some of the other things the government has come out with, like with Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>, which are just a whole bunch of bills that come together that continue to impact Canadians negatively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767998">My friend from <Affiliation DbId="278561" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation> was talking about censorship. I thought I would talk about trust and hope and how this is just another example of how Canadians have lost trust in the government and have lost hope for the future. When we look at the data, it is very clear. We see the data between 2014 and 2024. People ask where the hope is and what can they see for their futures. As a mom of five, and I am very proud of being a mom of five, I am now watching my children, who are between the ages of 21 and 30, asking what the world is going to look like for them. How are they going to get ahead? I will add more to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8767999">I think it comes down to something very simple. If we look as of 11 a.m. today, we had $1.356 trillion in debt here in Canada. This number makes me very queasy, knowing that just 10 years ago, under the Harper government in 2014, our debt was $648 million. That is $648 million compared to $1.3 billion in nine years, which is just absolutely ludicrous. We know that is just wasteful spending and unaccountable spending as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768000">Things like the current number of people working in Canada and the GDP are all data points we need to look at when we are talking about the economy and why we are talking about things not working. If we do not have a strong economy, everything starts falling apart. We have to look at the economy as a piece of this puzzle that has created so many drastic problems for people. On employment specifically, we have seen a decrease in employment. In Canada, as of October 2024, we currently have 33,977,000 people working, which is 60.6% of the population.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8768001">Just 10 years ago, we had 61.6% of the population working, which was over 28,930,000. This matters because at the end of the day, it is those people who are employed and paying taxes on their employment or pensions or whatever it may be, who are putting back into the system. It is really important that we have people out there working because it also adds to our GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768002">I had a great conversation about this with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>. We were talking about what the GDP looks like and why it is important to understand the GDP-to-population ratio. When I talk about the number of people working being down to 60.6% from 61.6% just a decade ago, we then have to look at where our GDP is, and that is where these numbers become astounding. I compared the numbers for Canada, looking at 2014 to 2024, but also looked at GDP in the United States. I am not looking at total GDP, but looking at the increase because that is giving us the hope for prosperity. When people see an increase in our GDP that looks healthy, they know that there is hope for their businesses, for their future, for their employment and for their children's future as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768003">In 2014, we saw a 2.87% GDP growth rate. In the United States, it was very similar at 2.52%. Today, when we are looking at the data, it is not a full year, but in 2024, our GDP growth rate right now is 1.34%, compared to the U.S. at 2.77%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768004">If we want to look at entire years, in 2023, we can look at Canada at 1.25% compared to the U.S. at 2.89% in 2023. When GDP growth rate is down, that is when people start losing great hope. What are they going to do when it comes to employment? How are their businesses going to survive? In the last few weeks, we have had many discussions with the people in my riding talking about how they are going to survive if we cannot have good public policy and legislation and the United States is talking about putting a 25% tariff on items coming from Canada. For people within my constituency, the moment that was announced, the phone started ringing. In my riding and in many areas of Canada, we are exporting 80% of our goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768005"> I spoke earlier to a gentleman who builds scoreboards, so we can watch some of those great NCAA scoreboards and know that they were built in London, Ontario. Eighty per cent of his markets are U.S. high schools and universities. If there is a 25% tariff, his business will close, so we have to make sure that the government is doing the right thing. That is what we have seen over the last week and a half. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768006">Down in the United States, they talked about our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, but, honestly, looking at the current government on its last leg, or actually on its last toe, it is really hard to know that it is doing the negotiating for the future of Canada when we do not feel confident in our own economy and our own strength. Therefore, when we are sending team Canada down to the United States, we need to make sure team Canada has some very strong representatives from the Conservative Party. When we become the government, we need to make sure that we have a very strong relationship so people like Jeff in my riding do not lose their entire business because of bad policies and relationships with the United States. It really comes down to the importance of making sure we have those trade relationships, making sure we have good policy, and making sure that our economy will continue to have drive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768007">Going from those GDP numbers, we have to look at other issues. Here in Canada, we are currently at a birth rate of 1%, which does not replace our Canadian population. We need 2.1% for replacement. For me, I step back and say that I have done my job; I have five kids and I am doing really well. I step back and think, why are other people not having children? For me, it is pretty darn simple. I can sit there and look at my own children. My son, who is 28 years old, is running his own business and I absolutely love what he is doing, but it is difficult starting. As a starter-business owner, he can do a great job, but then he also has to pay for his rent and his food and everything else. For him, it would probably be better right now to get a part-time job and have his actual career on the side so that he can pay for the groceries and pay for rent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768008">The way that this economy is right now, when people are paying almost $2,000 a month for rent and utilities, it is darn hard to get ahead. I feel bad when I say to my kids that I paid $220 a month in 1991 when I was in university to live in the worst place ever in a London residence when I was at Western University.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8768009"> I have friends whose children are paying $1,600 a month just to live in a four-bedroom house or apartment. Mine was $220 a month. We have to look at the debt load being applied to our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768010">We are seeing a rate of 1% increase. We know that the cost of student debt has increased. In 2014, when people were graduating, it was about $12,800 for student debt. Now in 2024, it is way over $30,000. We are not using the data on the rent increases that we have seen on many of our students who are using the food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768011"> Why are we having these issues? It is because we have a government that does not spend wisely and continues to increase our debt for future generations to try to dig out of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768012">When I am looking at the cost to our students, 10 years ago student debt was a little over $12,000. Now I look at students in 2024 with a $30,000 debt load trying to rent an apartment starting at $2,000. Can members imagine trying to pay off student debt, get food in the cupboards and actually pay the rent. If they want a car and insurance, well, holy cow, they would need to be lucky.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768013"> I look at the people who live in my riding, which is very rural. People need a car to drive from home to work. There is no public transportation, nor is there really a business plan for that at this time because of the population and how few people would be using that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768014">We have to look at our children today, who have these exorbitant costs, whether they are paying taxes, and we have this great debt of $1.3 trillion, or whether they are paying for food, and the cost of inflation. It is very difficult for our children to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768015">I am going to talk about my son who is hopefully going to be a plumber soon. He had taken a few years off school and then decided to go into plumbing. The opportunities for him in plumbing are endless. People say, “Hey, you're an apprentice? Great, we'd love to take you on.” We are looking, all the time, for people to have these opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768016">I think of my son and the fact is that he will probably have a job in about six months. Fantastic, but I bet it will take a long time for him to actually get out of my basement. After becoming a plumber, how would he pay to get into a house or to rent something, when he still has to buy his food and all of those things? He will be very fortunate because he is not going to have student debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768017">That is very unlikely for the majority of the population in this country. He will still have the extraordinary costs of buying tools and supplies. Plumbing is not a cheap job to start off with, so starting his own business will be very very difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768018">Once again, the idea of being able to say, “I have got a job. I have graduated from school. I am going to go forward. I am going to get married. I am going to have children. I am going to have that white picket fence,” those dreams that we talked about in the 1980s, they are so gone for this group of people that are part of Generation Z.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768019">It is going to be difficult because when we look at productivity, it is one of our greatest challenges. We are going through a mental health crisis. I urge everybody to read this book that I have read called, <I>The Anxious Generation</I>. It is talking about Gen Z and what they are going through. I love to read it and ask myself, what am I doing, and how am I screwing up my kids?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768020">I was listening to one colleague last night who talked about <I>Dallas</I> and <I>Dynasty</I>. He was talking about the government being very much like that, and having amnesia. Those were good years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768021">I think of the stress that my own children and all of their friends are looking at in 2024. When I graduated from university, my debt load was probably about $6,000 or $7,000, very minimal compared to what people are going out with now. I was also able to buy a house when I was 25 years old for $122,000. I was also able to get a job and, this is the best part, that paid $12 an hour, but that was okay because it actually paid the bills. That $12 an hour, back in 1993, after graduating, paid the bills. It paid for my house. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768022">Now we have lost hope. We have lost hope for this future. I look at my five kids and I love them to pieces. I do not know how many of them will be moving home when it comes to trying to find affordable living.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8768023"> That is very difficult for me as a parent, thinking about what I did or did not do to set them up properly. It is not that I do not think I have set them up properly. They have been in great school systems. They have had amazing teachers over the years and amazing opportunities, but when it comes to them actually stepping outside the house, going and buying their own things, trying to create their own credit limit and trying to rent a place, mom and dad are very necessary. That is what we are seeing with this generation: Those in generation Z are really having to depend on their families, their parents. We have a generation of people, my generation, who are not only paying for their own bills but also helping their children out. The children cannot afford to pay for bills right now, with the cost of living and with their own student debts. This is something that we did not see 20 and 30 years ago. We now see that hope lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768024">Those are the things that I think of when we are looking at the green slush fund and we are looking at where the government is and asking about what has gone wrong. We can say that it is poor direction, poor administration and poor ideas. There are ideas where we are throwing out money, but we should ask what we are actually sometimes getting in return. We have talked about very many social programs. Some have had a positive impact, and some have had a negative impact. I would really love to see what the cost rationale is for some of these things. For every dollar spent, are we actually leveraging a better Canada, or are we just throwing our money away? Those are the concerns I have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768025">We look at the birth rate of 1%; we are trying to get a new workforce in this country and not being able to do that. We look at our extravagant student debt load. We look at the rate of people being employed in Canada, which is less than 60% right now; many of those are people paying bills so that other people can have benefits. We are looking at our GDP being at less than 1.25% right now. These things do not give us a lot of hope. They do not give the businesses that are trying to get into business more hope either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768026">That is why I wanted to talk at the last minute on the green slush fund and what it has done to start-ups. We have seen start-ups that have had to drop 30% of their labour force because what they were doing with the government stopped working. Because of the failure of the government on this technology program, which had been existing for over 20 years, we are now seeing technology companies having to decrease. It has actually taken away the competitive nature that was in place for so many years when it comes to technology in Canada. We have taken that away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768027">Those are some of the greatest concerns that I have moving forward. In the last 20 minutes, I have spoken about how we have seen nine years of the government creating greater debt and less hope for the next generation. We have seen a lot of stress. I do not see it getting better under the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768028">We have talked about there needing to be an election. As everybody knows, I plan on retiring. If there is an election tomorrow, I am praying that we win with a Conservative majority. At the end of the day, we need to ensure that we have good programs and fiscal responsibility to get on track. These are things that I have great concerns about. I do not know whether that will be the case if we continue under the government for the next year that we are scheduled for. I can see that our GDP will only continue to decline, our debt will only increase and our hope will only decrease as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768031">Madam Speaker, I will be honest. I have heard many people talk about the environment; it is important. It is important to me and to everybody in this chamber. However, it may look a little different in terms of the way we approach it. We had a great way of dealing with issues over 20 years. When we look at such things as the green slush fund, this is how we lose faith in what the government is doing. When the government asks us to support its carbon tax approach, we can talk about what it has done with the green slush fund and any other program it has had. That is not fiscal responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768032">We can talk about the fact that people get rebates, but rebates only come after people have given their money forward. It is like giving a gift and then getting it back. It is great to refer to eight out of 10 families, but if we continue to read the data from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the data indicates that this information is not actually accurate. I have farmers who are paying over $11,000 a month. If members want to know why the price of food is going up, it is because there has been this increase on such things as grains and oilseeds at the very start of the food process.</ParaText>

The next generation expects leaders to do their job conscientiously and honestly. In the case of the green fund under discussion today, the focus of our debate, three out of four projects failed to meet the basic rules of ethics. More than $390 million of a $500-million budget was mismanaged. This means that 78% was managed all wrong, and four out of five projects broke the rules of ethics.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768079">Madam Speaker, I look forward to the question from the now former member of the public accounts committee, where things have changed since his departure. The Liberal and NDP members at public accounts have introduced a closure motion to cut off debate. This is despite the fact that, in recent weeks, we learned even more about the enrichment of personal financial interests by Liberal-appointed officials overseeing SDTC as well as other benefactors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768080">For example, the radical Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> joined the cabinet, and after that his shares in Cycle Capital skyrocketed. This was not a stroke of luck. It was a direct consequence of the abuse of his public office to funnel more taxpayer money into Cycle Capital through the Liberal green slush fund. Since the environment minister's appointment in 2019, another $17 million has flown into the company. This double-dealing is totally unethical, but apparently allowed under the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768081">Our committee has asked the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to appear for the last two months to answer questions from members, but he will not. What we have seen over and over again is the minister trying to dodge this accountability, to stonewall and to hide from the public accounts committee. I know the environment minister has appeared at other committees. However, when our clerk contacted his office and offered any date over the last two months, we were told it was not possible due to scheduling issues with his calendar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768082">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> believes he is above Parliament. He believes the repeat abuse of tax dollars should not be questioned. That is the heart of the matter as to why we are here tonight and why this Parliament is dysfunctional under the Liberals. They too do not believe they have to be accountable to this place, which is why they are wrongly withholding documents that Parliament has ordered. They are, in fact, engaging in a huge cover-up to prevent Canadians from knowing how this program operated, how it was broken and who benefited from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768083">When the House of Commons ordered the production of papers related to the scandal, the government used every trick in the book to keep the truth from being known. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office instructed departments to use the Privacy Act to censor documents, even though the law clearly states the Privacy Act cannot be used to withhold documents from Parliament. This is not transparency. This is the total opposite. This is obstruction and it is a direct affront to the principles of democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768084">This leads me to the rot that was fostered by Liberal appointees like Annette Verschuren, who was appointed by Navdeep Bains, the former minister of industry, over the objections of the previous CEO of the SDTC program. What followed was not a management of conflicts, but a systematic looting of taxpayer funds. A shocking 82% of the transactions sampled by the Auditor General were in a direct conflict of interest. A staggering $400 million approved by the board benefited their own companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768085">Liberal Minister Bains chose Ms. Verschuren, despite the fact that her company was already doing business with SDTC and was in a conflict of interest. However, Mr. Bains told the committee he does not remember any of this. I do not know about anyone in this room, but if I was tasked with making an appointment for a billion-dollar program that gave out tax money, I would take some notes. If a committee had questions about it, I think I would be in a position to answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768086">Of course, the value of Mr. Verschuren's investments dramatically increased thanks to SDTC funding. Practically overnight, the company's value exploded. It was not because of the technology it produced, a competitive process or even the patents it owned, but because of an injection of tax dollars. Even when these glaring conflicts were brought to light, what did the Liberals do? They did nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768087">Senior executives at SDTC like Ziyad Rahme refused to even address the issue of bonuses for those who oversaw these corrupt dealings. He dodged the question no less than seven times at committee, stating vaguely that any bonuses would comply with employment law. However, the truth is that, under the Liberals, overseeing a billion-dollar slush fund that enriches insiders does not just earn someone a salary; it earns them a bonus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768088">I want to thank the Auditor General, who has been relentless in her efforts to ensure that the truth was brought to light. However, it is now up to parliamentarians to ask tough questions and to receive answers from the government that continues to stonewall us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768089">The government's ongoing cover-up has paralyzed Parliament and has obstructed the truth from reaching Canadians. The former deputy minister responsible for SDTC, John Knubley, also appeared before the public accounts committee, and he gave a convenient story about not being aware of the many conflicts of interest. He said it was his deputy's responsibility. The top civil servant washed his hands of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768090"> Meanwhile, the assistant deputy minister he was referring to, Andrew Noseworthy, who attended every single board meeting where monies were dispersed, where Liberals were funnelling money to other insiders, to their own companies, was the department's supposed eyes and ears on the board. However, he claims he did not report obvious conflicts of interest because he was “not a lawyer.” This is absolutely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768091"> The position of a senior government official is to protect the interests of taxpayers, not to turn a blind eye to corruption and obvious conflicts. We must ask ourselves how many more programs under the Liberal government are being mismanaged in this way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768092">SDTC was a billion-dollar fund riddled with conflicts of interest, a fund that was meant to advance technology, not enrich Liberal insiders, yet here we are, finding out that no one, from ministers to political appointments to senior bureaucrats, is accountable. It is clear what we are dealing with, a dirty trio of fraud, corruption and lies. Hand-picked board members have fleeced Canadian taxpayers using a simple scheme: get on a board that approves government funding; own shares in a company; tell that company to apply for funding; approve that funding as a board member; and profit, big time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768093"> The Liberal insiders turned SDTC into their personal piggy bank. This is not just a story of mismanagement. It is a story of corruption that reaches the very top of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office. Indeed, the PMO's previous director of appointments, involved with the decision to select Ms. Verschuren, despite all her conflicts, is nowhere to be found, has disappeared and, today, cannot be found to be summoned to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768094"> To my colleagues on the government bench, we all remember the Aga Khan scandal, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took illegal vacations to a billionaire's island. We all remember the SNC-Lavalin scandal, when Liberals fired their own colleague for standing up to the Prime Minister's pressure. We all remember the WE Charity scandal, when millions of dollars were paid to a supposed charity that paid, of course, members of the Trudeau family for, we do not know what, but something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768095">Time and again, we see the same story: a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who believes the rules do not apply to him or his family. Today I stand here, not just as a member of the Conservative opposition, but as a representative of Canadians who are tired of this behaviour. Canadians work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules, and they deserve a government that does the same. They deserve a leader who will put their interests above those of well-connected insiders. We cannot allow this culture of corruption to continue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768096">That is why my colleagues and I will continue to push for the release of all unredacted documents related to this program scandal. We will continue to demand accountability from the government in the House and at the public accounts committee. We will continue to fight for the principles of transparency and good governance, which are the foundation of our democracy. This green slush fund scandal is not just about money. It is about trusting that the government will act in the best interest of its people, not for the benefit of a select few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768097"> The refusal to provide unredacted documents is a blatant disregard for the authority of Parliament, and it sends a dangerous message that the government thinks it is above the law. This is not just about dollars and cents. It is about the principles that underpin our democracy, principles that should never be compromised.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768098">I want to take a moment to address the broader implication of the scandal of public trust in the government, because once trust is broken, it is very difficult, maybe even impossible, to repair. Canadians deserve to have confidence in their government, confidence that it will act in the best interest of Canada, uphold the highest standards of integrity and be accountable for its actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768099">I know where I stand, and on this side of the House, we want our colleagues on the government bench to take a stand as well. We cannot sit idly by while our institutions are eroded and the trust of Canadians is betrayed. Canadians are watching us. They are watching to see whether we will stand up for them or whether the Liberals will once again turn a blind eye to corruption. They are watching to see whether we will take action to protect their hard-earned tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768100">The time for excuses is over. It is time for accountability and transparency in government. It is time for a change after nine long years of the tired and corrupt <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I am confident that in the next election, Canadians will make their voices heard and choose a government that will serve them with integrity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768101">Canadians will remember that the green slush fund scandal is not just about the misuse of taxpayer dollars but also about the principle that no one, not even the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, is above the law. The refusal of the government to provide the documents requested by Parliament is a clear violation of those principles. It is an attempt to subvert Parliament to shield from accountability the people responsible for the corruption. Parliament must not allow it to happen. When a majority of members of the chamber are in agreement that the documents must be released, it is a signal that the trust has been broken and that the government must act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768102"> In the upcoming election, Canadians will have the opportunity to choose a different path. I stand today to say that Conservatives will bring on a government that Canadians can trust, a government that will be a responsible steward of their tax dollars and a government that will always act in the best interests of the people who elect them to serve them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768103">We will ensure that the people in positions of power are held accountable for their actions. This means real consequences for ethical violations and conflicts of interest, not just a slap on the wrist or, worse, the idea that these things are not even happening and do not matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768104">We will ensure that tax dollars are spent wisely and responsibly. This means ending the culture of cronyism that has taken hold in the Liberal government and in too much of the bureaucracy. It means ensuring that public contracts and grants are awarded based on merit, not on whom one knows. It means bringing transparency to the process so Canadians can see exactly how their money is being spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768105">We owe it to the people of this great nation to live up to the standards they expect of their government, indeed the standards they live every day in their life and in their community. Unlike our opponents, Conservatives seek to govern for the betterment of Canada, not to flout accountability rules and make Canadians pay more to insiders and well-connected Liberals. We will work for Canadians. Conservatives will deliver a government that will improve this country and finally clean up the mess here in Ottawa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768142"> It is of obvious interest to the Conservatives to try to score one on the Liberals, while ignoring the convenient fact that Ms. Verschuren is kicking back money that she stole from taxpayers to the Conservative Party. They do not want to talk about that. They do not want to talk about the fact that their party is so corrupt, one of the most corrupt parties ever to exist in this country. It is the same party that invented residential schools, the same party that said we were going to have a sixties scoop and the same party that said first nations people do not deserve clean water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768143">My colleagues will have to forgive me if I do not believe them when they say they are ready to stand up for Canadians. They are not ready to stand up for Canadians. They are barely ready to stand up for the truth, because the truth is that Ms. Verschuren has kicked back money she got through SDTC as donations of the maximum amount to the Conservative Party for over a decade. They like to deflect by saying it is not that much money. A little bit of corruption is great, right? It is okay. We can have a little bit of corruption. No, we cannot tolerate any of it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768150">I will get back to the point of how much Ms. Verschuren donated to the Conservative Party, the maximum amount, when she was also serving as chair of SDTC. She donated the maximum amount but not to a leadership campaign. For some reason the Conservatives think that is less relevant, but she donated the maximum amount in a non-leadership campaign in March 2024, directly to the Conservative Party; on February 6, directly to the Conservative Party; on February 6, 2017, directly to the Conservative Party; on March 19, 2009, directly to the Conservative Party; and on May 31, 2023, directly to the Conservative Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768151">There were dozens and dozens of donations over the last decades as she served as a Liberal-Conservative crony, and the Conservatives do not want to face this fact. However, I want them to, because if they did, maybe we could try to rebuild the reputation of the Conservative Party, which consistently wants to omit real, relative facts to this real, serious issue. We have this SDTC fund created in 2001. Several times over again, they seek to defend their crony culture, but then they blame the other guys every time it is one of their members. They are the same party of the same coin. At the end of the day, the Liberals and Conservatives stand for the very same policies. They stand for the very same people, and they get donations from the very same individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768152">That is something we have failed to speak about in this place, but I will turn back to the matter at hand, which is relative to Ms. Verschuren and her conduct. It is true that Ms. Verschuren, during her time donating to the Conservative Party, multiple times throughout her career, did in fact, at one point, stand for, at least in some instances, green technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768153">Another unfortunate reality of the SDTC fund is the fact that we support the green initiative policy. It is important that we continue to do that. Me and my colleagues, New Democrats in particular, believe that Canadians can build the best and most innovative technologies in the world. We can do that right here in our country, and that innovation could also be used to support good union jobs while also supporting the very important innovation that is needed to combat the climate crisis. We could do both. We could have a fantastic economy, and we can support workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768154">I want to mention support for workers. We had a whole debate around workers, and in this case, we are having a debate about workers again. However, the Conservatives have never stood on a picket line in their entire lives. It is a fact that they have never done that. Every time a union goes to bat to exercise its members' constitutional rights, to increase their wages, to increase safety in the workplace, to make certain that they have work-life balance, the Conservatives always opt for back-to-work legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768155">I find it rich that the so-called party of workers, which is the cosplay Conservatives, consistently say that they are for workers when every time they have a chance to, they are nowhere to be found. I have stood on every single picket line and I have never seen one Conservative there. Madam Speaker, I know that is also the case for you, as well as for me and my colleagues. I dare the Conservatives to stand on a picket line for once in their lives. Show us if they can even do that, which is an important piece to this work. However, now they are going to be upset—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768200"> Madam Speaker, I am responding to the question the member asked in the House not long ago. I would just remind him that in recent years, climate change has had unprecedented effects on Canadians. Impacts from climate change are wide-ranging, affecting our homes, the cost of living, infrastructure, health and safety, and economic activity in communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768201">Released yesterday, “Canada's Food Price Report 2025” states that extreme weather and climate change pose significant challenges to the cost of food, something I know the hon. member is very interested in as someone from an agricultural community. The science is clear: We must continue taking ambitious actions to combat climate change before it is too late. This includes using all of the tools in our tool box, including putting a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768202">Despite what the Conservatives may think, the Bank of Canada has confirmed that carbon pricing contributes less than 1% to inflation. In fact the impact of carbon pricing on inflation is just 0.15%. Our government's plan to combat climate change is working. For the first time in Canadian history, we are on track to meet a climate goal, in 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768203">We are focused on building a stronger economy, combatting climate change and making life more affordable; that is exactly what putting a price on pollution does. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has confirmed multiple times that the vast majority of Canadians are better off with the Canada carbon rebate. A family of four in the riding of Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa, a very beautiful part of my home province, the member's home province of Manitoba, with the Canada carbon rebate, will receive $1,200 a year. That is not all; in rural communities, residents will receive an additional 20% top-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768204">We remain focused on the bigger picture: protecting Canadians from the devastating impacts of climate change and ensuring a prosperous future for generations to come.</ParaText>

I would like to hear him and his party, for once, talk about climate change, the opportunities it has for our economy and the impacts it is having on agriculture and on people's lives from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768210"> Madam Speaker, I take some exception to how my colleague across the way just responded to my other colleague on this side of the house. We all believe there is climate change going on here, and no matter what the narrative of his party is, we actually understand what to do about it. His party has been failing at it for nine years now, quite frankly, because they are spending money and getting absolutely nothing done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768211">I am here tonight to ask more questions about the Sustainable Development Technologies Canada scandal that I asked a question about some weeks ago in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768212">Let us revisit the timeline. This started in early 2023, when a whistle-blower at SDTC came forth and said there were significant malfunctions happening there, conflicts of interest and money going out where it should not go out. Then in December 2023, that whistle-blower appeared before a parliamentary committee and disclosed exactly what was going on. It was evidenced for everybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768213"> Following that, on June 4, 2024, SDTC was disbanded as an organization and rolled into the NRC, as far as what it was doing, dispensing funds for green innovation in Canada. Not to precede anything, but suddenly, on June 6, the Auditor General came out and ruled in a report that, effectively, there were a whole bunch of conflicts of interest, that $76 million in funding was tied to conflicts of interest and another $60 million went to projects that were not even eligible under the requirements of the program. It was just a complete shemozzle of a program. That is what we are dealing with here in Parliament right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768214"> Subsequently, on July 24, the Ethics Commissioner ruled that the chair of SDTC, Annette Verschuren, was in violation of ethics guidelines. She had approved grants to her own firms through that SDTC funding mechanism. This is interesting because, of course, as we go all the way through this piece, it is about granting funds to an organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768215"> This came to the House of Commons. We are looking for these documents to see exactly where these funds have gone, the entities that have benefited from this and, of course, the connected individuals, all of whom seem to have Liberal connections. This is why we want the documents in front of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768216"> The Speaker fully ruled on this, that the government defied the authority of Parliament by refusing to hand over documents relating to SDTC. This House of Parliament, the House that is supreme in our democracy, voted with a majority to get those documents in front of Parliament, to have them handed over. We are supposed to turn them over to the law clerk, who would then distribute them to the RCMP for its investigation of this matter. The government is to hand over all files, communications and financial records to Parliament's law clerk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768217">Beyond rare exceptions, as noted, for the sake of national security, the House of Commons has the absolute power to produce any documents pertaining to the House's business. All kinds of protestations have come from colleagues on the Liberal side that, in fact, this is something they cannot do at this point in time. The Speaker of the House rejected every argument. Still, the Liberals are not providing the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768218">To finalize, my question is this: What is in those documents that is going to lead to Canadians seeing how much money the government has wasted in its green attempts to accomplish nothing?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768219"> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague, whom I respect greatly. I am happy to respond to his comments regarding Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768220">The government remains committed to providing the documents sought in the House of Commons motion from June 10. In fact, the government has already submitted thousands of pages of records to the law clerk for onward distribution to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or the RCMP. I suspect the member opposite knows this, but the Conservatives would rather filibuster their own motion and hold up the important business of the House than move forward with the important work of helping Canadians. Quite simply, to say that the government is intentionally withholding documentation is a serious accusation, and it is simply false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768221">The government has been very forthcoming since the allegations against SDTC first came to light in early 2023. In fact, as soon as the allegations were made, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> took immediate action to investigate and undertake proper due diligence to understand the facts and get to the bottom of the issue at hand. As part of that process, the government worked diligently to respond to the findings of multiple independent reviews of SDTC, including third party audits, committee studies and a report from the Office of the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768222">I would like to remind the member opposite that SDTC was created by Parliament as an arm's-length organization. This model allowed for oversight but emphasized that the work of identifying clean tech projects would lie with those within the independent organization with the appropriate expertise. To claim that the government was directly involved in SDTC is inaccurate; not only that, but it runs contrary to the arm's-length mandate that existed with SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768223">That being said, at the conclusion of the various reviews and audits, it became apparent that the arm's-length nature of SDTC was no longer working and necessitated change. That is why we announced a new delivery approach for SDTC programming to enhance due diligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768224">It is the prerogative of the RCMP to undertake an investigation, and no one in this room is privy to its nature. The government is prepared to offer its full co-operation with the RCMP if and when required. At the same time, we listened to the RCMP when it confirmed that handing over documents to the House to be transferred to the RCMP could jeopardize any ongoing investigations. That, I think, gives us all pause for thought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768225">Instead of continuing to hold this place hostage with a Conservative filibuster, we should let the RCMP investigation continue, free of political interference and involvement, while also referring this matter to committee as directed by the Speaker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768227">As far as the RCMP goes, we all know that the RCMP can ignore evidence. It has not given any indication that it would find the information provided by Parliament would be out of line. Maybe the member stood for Parliament not understanding his role here, but Parliament is supreme. We voted to have these documents produced. We want the documents.

              <ParaText id="8768233">Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country. I rise today to address an issue that worries most of the residents in my riding of Kelowna—Lake Country, and this is the NDP-Liberal government's continued commitment to higher taxation. On April 1, the carbon tax and the excise tax on alcoholic beverages are going to go up again, and the capital gains tax has gone up, impeding investments and retirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768234"> First is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s favourite tax on everything: the carbon tax. Despite widespread opposition against the carbon tax from the majority of Canadians, 62% according to a recent Leger poll, and a majority of premiers across all political parties, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> confirmed this past week that his government will still increase its carbon tax by 19% on April 1. The NDP-Liberal plan to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre by the end of this decade is just wrong for farmers, businesses, families and our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768235"> The Fraser Institute reported that the carbon tax will result in 57,000 fewer jobs and a 6.2% reduction in Canada's GDP. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has already confirmed that Canadian families suffer a net cost from the carbon tax, paying far more in taxes than they receive back in rebates. That is fewer dollars in Canadians' pockets while doing nothing for our environment. On top of this, GST is charged on the carbon tax. This is a tax on a tax, which is absolutely wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768236"> Recently, I had the privilege of attending meetings of the trade committee to ask witnesses about the damaging impacts of the Liberal capital gains tax hike. The Council of Canadian Innovators commissioned a survey of entrepreneurs, and the results showed that 90% of respondents believe the Liberals' capital gains tax hike would negatively affect the innovation economy. We heard from many entrepreneurs and investors that Canada will be less competitive for talent, investment and capital in the global market because of this capital gains tax hike. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768237">Arlene Dickinson, the legendary Canadian venture capitalist best known for supporting small business owners on <I>Dragons' Den</I>, told me she did not believe the Liberal budget when it said, “Increasing the capital gains inclusion rate is not expected to hurt Canada's business competitiveness.” Instead of supporting our entrepreneurs, the NDP-Liberal government views them only as a cash cow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768238"> Last, coming from a region with many wineries, cideries, distilleries and breweries, I must raise the Liberals' commitment to raising the alcohol escalator excise tax by 2% again next year. Speaking with residents of mine who work in this sector, I know the pressures on their bottom line. These costs will only be passed on to our local retailers, restaurant owners and other licensees, putting unnecessary economic pressure on an industry in the heart of the Okanagan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768239"> Tax increases ultimately always get passed on to the consumer. Canadians cannot afford the squeeze anymore. The NDP-Liberal government's cost of living crisis will not end until it brings permanent, long-lasting tax relief for everyone. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768240">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's debate and discuss the measures the government is taking to make life more affordable in Canada, especially as the holiday season approaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768241"> Inflation is way down and has been back within the Bank of Canada's target rate for 10 months in a row. Wage growth has now outpaced inflation for 21 consecutive months. Earlier this summer, the Bank of Canada lowered interest rates for the first time, making Canada the first G7 country to do so. It has since lowered interest rates three more times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768242"> Although inflation and interest rates are falling, we know that Canadians are not yet feeling the effects on their household budgets. This is particularly true during the festive season. That is why, starting December 14, the government wants to give a tax break to Canadians, which the Conservatives oppose. The temporary two-month GST/HST exemption for select expenses means Canadians would be able to buy items like prepared food, snacks, children's clothing and toys, all tax free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768243">This means that a family spending $2,000 on qualifying goods during the relief period between December 14, 2024, and February 15, 2025, would realize GST savings of $100. This tax break would last until February 15. This would deliver meaningful savings for Canadians by making essentially all food GST/HST free and providing real relief at the cash register.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768244">Madam Speaker, I am not surprised that the member opposite is raising the recent temporary, two-month, tax trick, but the key word is that it is temporary. Conservatives will favour permanent tax relief, such as axing the carbon tax. Looking at the capital gains tax or at the escalator on excise tax as well would provide relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768245">The short-term Liberal tax trick on a last-minute Christmas tree will not mean much when the carbon tax on every Canadian's gas, groceries and home heating will rise 19% on April 1, 2025. Christmas tree farmers in my region are small and would not even charge GST anyway because their business is small.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768246">Conservatives will have a tax reform. We will axe the federal tax on new homes sold under $1 million to build more homes and put more money into first-time homebuyers' pockets. Conservatives will actually lower taxes so people have more money in their pockets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8768247"> Madam Speaker, thanks to the measures we recently announced, Canadians will be able to concentrate more on celebrating the festive season with family and friends and to start the new year with a little more money in their pockets. Canadians can continue to count on the government to make life more affordable in this country on an ongoing basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8768248">As Canadians, we have so much to be thankful for. Canadians work hard and they deserve to celebrate their achievements. That is what the new holiday-season support is all about.</ParaText>
