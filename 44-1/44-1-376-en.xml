              <ParaText id="8728422">I am proud to rise in the House this morning to represent the people of the wonderful riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, but I am also proud to live in a bilingual country where people speak French and English. I am taking the time to focus on French and English because it is important to remember that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of this Liberal government appointed a Governor General who is bilingual but does not speak one of the two official languages, French. Worse still, he appointed a unilingual anglophone lieutenant governor for Canada's only bilingual province, New Brunswick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728423">The list of examples demonstrating this Liberal government's lack of intention or willingness to protect French is too long for me to read right now. I would not want to run out of time for my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728424">Bilingualism is central to our Canadian identity. I stand here today in our nation's most important democratic chamber, where French and English have been granted equal privileges since its creation in 1867. Canada's francophonie outside Quebec is vibrant and resilient, reflecting the perseverance of a language and a culture that have endured for generations despite facing challenges. At the same time, Quebec's francophonie, with its rich culture and its role as the stronghold of French in North America, bears witness to a strong, proud collective identity. Together, these two distinct, but complementary, facets of the francophonie enrich Canada's identity and remind us about the importance of preserving this unique linguistic duality, which is a source of national pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728425">Why am I talking about Canadian identity? The answer is quite simple. The Broadcasting Act states that the programming provided by the CBC should:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728431">Understandably, I nearly fell off my chair when I saw a headline in the Journal de Montréal on October 11, 2023, that read: “CBC Podcasts translated podcast into French in Paris to avoid the Quebec accent”. What a disgrace. I thought I must have read it wrong. As I read the article, I learned that CBC Podcasts chose to contract a studio in Paris instead of local talent to adapt the hit Canadian podcast <I>Alone: A Love Story</I> into French—I said the title in English because I am a staunch defender of English-French bilingualism in Canada—because the Quebec accent would have less international potential. Is that part of CBC/Radio-Canada's mandate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728432">When confronted in committee, Ms. Tait, the CEO of CBC/Radio Canada, told us that it was just a mistake and that it would never happen again. Can such contempt for Quebeckers and Canada's francophones be so easily excused? She said this as the person who was CEO during the period when the CBC's audience numbers plummeted by nearly 50%, forcing her to cut 800 jobs last December.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728433">Yesterday, Ms. Tait told the Canadian heritage committee that she was entitled to a performance bonus. Wow. After failing to produce content that Canadians actually want to consume, and after missing 79% of the key performance targets that they made for themselves, it is clear that the last thing CBC executives deserve is more bonuses. To all the Radio-Canada fans out there, I want to be crystal clear that we in the Conservative Party of Canada will defund the CBC, which is an antiquated broadcaster that has fallen out of touch with the interests of Canadian anglophones, but we will maintain funding for Radio-Canada and its French-language programming. It is important that we make this clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728434">The role of a public broadcaster is to offer content that the private market cannot deliver, and the CBC's English-language services are no longer getting the job done. By contrast, Radio-Canada remains an essential broadcaster for Quebeckers and francophone minority communities. For them, there simply are no other comparable sources of news. By refocusing Radio-Canada's resources, we could enhance the services offered to francophone communities from the standpoint of programming quality or access to local and national news that actually reflects their reality. The Conservative Party's goals when it comes to official languages have always been clear. We must halt the decline of French and protect and defend both official languages, both in Quebec and across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728435">Yesterday in committee, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation> moved a motion to halt the payment of bonuses to CBC executives. When I found out how it went, I fell off my chair again, and now my hip is a little sore. Do my colleagues know which members voted with their Liberal friends against the cancellation of these bonuses? It was the members of the Bloc Québécois. How disappointing. How can they justify paying a bonus to a CEO who holds Quebeckers and francophones in contempt? What is the point of the Bloc Québécois? Whom is it good for? The Bloc poses as the defender of Quebeckers and Canada's francophones, but it is in cahoots with the Liberals. What happened yesterday in committee was just the latest demonstration. I would add that the Bloc has introduced a bill that would add an extra layer of bureaucracy and worsen the daily struggles of official language minority communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728436">I have the privilege of working with official language minority communities and organizations that fight for their rights on a daily basis, and I can assure the House that they are showing perseverance and determination in their fight to keep French alive in minority communities across Canada. Here is an example. Outside Quebec, the place where the use of French as a second language is increasing the most is Yukon. I commend Yukon's communities for their hard work and perseverance. The results are very clear. All across Canada, people are proud to be Quebeckers and Canadians and proud to be interested in learning the other official language. According to a report from the Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada, 87% of Canadians want to be bilingual. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728437">In conclusion, the only party that really wants to halt the decline of French throughout Canada, including in Quebec, and protect and promote both official languages is the Conservative Party of Canada.</ParaText>

Before going any further, I would like to remind my colleagues that Radio-Canada costs Canadian taxpayers more than $1 billion. Radio-Canada gets approximately 30% to 40% of the audience. Unfortunately, the CBC gets only 3%. Those are the facts. Decisions need to be made.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8728453">Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to a topic that makes me very indignant. My indignation is shared by millions of Quebeckers and Canadians. Let me explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728454">Once again, CBC/Radio-Canada, an institution funded with taxpayer money, is betraying the values, culture and trust of the people who pay for it to exist, the people it is supposed to serve and represent. The CBC chose to record a podcast in a Paris studio in order to avoid the Quebec accent. Shame on the CBC. This is an affront to me and my fellow Quebeckers. It is an affront to our culture, our contribution to Canada, and, lastly, our very existence, because the CBC's message is all too clear. The message is that the Quebec accent is offensive. That is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728455">It is hurtful, but it is not the only thing here that hurts us. I cannot talk about the CBC without mentioning the waste of public resources. For one thing, why did it use a studio in a foreign country when Canada and Quebec have perfectly well-equipped facilities capable of meeting its media needs? Why did it waste public funds instead of supporting the local economy, encouraging local talent and respecting our linguistic and cultural identities? On the one hand, we have the CBC's blatant affront to Quebeckers, but on the other, we have the CBC's CEO, Catherine Tait, demanding more and more money from taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728456">Just yesterday, Ms. Tait told the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage that she was entitled to a bonus. I would remind my colleagues that, under Ms. Tait, the CBC's overall audience level plummeted by almost half and that she was forced to cut 800 jobs in December 2023 alone. These cuts left hundreds of Quebec families scrambling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728457">In her opening statement yesterday, Ms. Tait asked the government for even more taxpayer dollars. Does anyone know what she did the last time the government gave her taxpayer money? Of the $42‑million emergency top-up the Liberal government gave her, $18.4 million went to executive bonuses. Another $3.3 million went to 45 executives. If we divide $3.3 million by 45, we get a bonus of about $73,000 per executive. That is more than the annual income of the average Canadian worker, yet Ms. Tait wants a bonus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728458"> What is the Bloc Québécois doing about all this? It is voting with the Liberals to protect CBC bonuses and support Ms. Tait. That is so appalling. Once again, the Bloc is showing that it will always put the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s interests before those of Quebeckers. I keep looking for a Bloc Québécois in the House, but day after day, all I can find is a “Liberal Bloc”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728459">How can we tolerate or justify this kind of abuse of public funds when millions of Canadians are unable to make ends meet, when millions of Canadians are lining up every day at food banks and when the number of unhoused is skyrocketing across Canada? Meanwhile, the CBC is wasting millions of dollars in public funds in unjustified bonuses and recording podcasts in Paris because they do not like the Quebec accent. It is unbelievably ironic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728460">It is a question of respect. It is a question of respecting taxpayer money of course, but it is even more a question of respecting the taxpayers themselves. The CBC does not respect Canada's values and cultures. By choosing to avoid the Quebec accent, the CBC is telling us loud and clear that our regions' accents and identities are not good enough. That is what that means. How ironic on the part of an organization that purports to represent Canadian diversity. What is diversity if not the recognition and promotion of our differences rather than their contempt and rejection? The Quebec accent is an integral part of the Canadian identity, the Canadian francophone identity and our Canadian heritage. Rejecting the accent means rejecting part of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728461">This contempt for Quebec and taxpayers did not appear out of thin air. It is fuelled by a Liberal government supported by the Bloc Québécois, which has lost all sense of priority. The Liberal government prefers paying the CBC millions of dollars and filling the pockets of its friend the president rather than thinking about Canadians' finances and addressing the real problems Canadians are facing after nine years of irresponsible governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728462">On our side of the House, we refuse to tolerate such contempt. The common-sense Conservatives say no to this culture of contempt and privilege. Canadians and Quebeckers deserve better. The common-sense Conservatives will defend taxpayers, workers and families. They will defend their interests and their paycheques rather than abuse them to fill the pockets of their friends and the CBC's corrupt and contemptuous senior executives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728484">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this very important issue. I want to start by focusing on the issue first, and then I will go into some of the motivations for having this particular debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728485">I for one am a very big fan of multiculturalism and the fact that Canada is a bilingual nation. With a name like Lamoureux, I can assure members that I have a very strong passion and belief in how important it is that Canada continues to promote and encourage being a bilingual nation. I thought I would give a bit of a reflection on what went wrong with my family in regard to the French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728486">My ancestors have been in Canada for generations. Many years ago, they went from the province of Quebec to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. During the 1950s, the French language was not very well received in certain parts of the Prairies. In this case, my grandmother on my mom's side, with the last name of Lambert and Pasquis, discouraged my mother from learning French. In fact, she never spoke it at home; my mother was told never to speak French, only English. That was in rural Saskatchewan during the 1950s. My father, in contrast, was raised in a family in which they spoke French fluently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728487">Before living in Winnipeg, my family was in St-Pierre-Jolys in rural Manitoba, which is still a strong French community today, along with St. Boniface. However, because of the disconnect during the 1960s, one would say that women's rights were not as great as they are today, so my mom was the one who raised us. She never spoke French in the household. We never had the opportunity to learn French, which is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728488">I would argue that French is spoken in the Prairies today to the degree that it is because of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. He believed in Canada as a bilingual nation. Through that belief, we started to see programming in our school and educational systems that promoted and encouraged speaking French. I still remember, in my earlier childhood, when French was not well received, particularly on the Prairies, by a good majority of people. That has changed in such a positive and encouraging way. I would date it back to the 1970s, when we had a solid commitment from the national government, saying that it wanted French spoken across the country. We needed to recognize the uniqueness of the province of Quebec and its culture and heritage, as well as to ensure that French was also spoken outside Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728489">Fast-forwarding to today, I can go into a number of schools in Winnipeg North and see people of Punjabi or Filipino heritage who can speak Punjabi, English and French.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728490">It is the same thing when we hear of children who are nine or 10 years old speaking Tagalog, French and English, as well as how popular the French language is as a respected language after one or two generations. It has changed. Today, there are more people speaking French in Canada than ever, and I would suggest that the number will continue to grow. As I said, I will look to Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the policy decisions he made back then as the root of this. Policy decisions matter; they make a difference, and that is why I posed the question in regard to CBC and Radio-Canada. Radio-Canada is very unique in the sense of the French language and the promotion thereof, not to mention CBC on the national scene and the important role it has to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728491">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, more than any other leader in the House of Commons, has a personal vendetta against CBC. Let us not kid ourselves. I have talked about the Tory, the Conservative-Reform hidden agenda, and we saw it in the question I had posed. We should not believe for a moment that the Conservatives look at Radio-Canada as something they would not make cuts to. When I posed the question previously, the member talked about whether we should be financing and so forth. He did not jump to the defence of Radio-Canada, let alone CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728492">Just yesterday, I quoted a CBC story to one of my colleagues. I quoted from a story being reported, and it happened to be CBC's story. It was a very serious quote that I gave to the member opposite. His response to it was that it was CBC, and he sat down. Conservatives do not have any respect for that national newscast. For the Canadians who might be following this debate, the Conservatives actually stopped participating in political panels in regard to CTV. I do not know if they are back at it, but I was attending both CBC and CTV political panels not that long ago, and the Conservatives were nowhere to be found.

Is it any wonder that people should be concerned about the Conservative Party of Canada, particularly the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation>, and its attitudes towards the CBC? The story is all about Conservatives and Conservative MPs who are concerned about the leader of the Conservative Party. They are being quoted; they do not want to use their names.

The people around him are only there to realize the leader's vision.” This is not me saying it and it is not CBC; it is reliable, numerous sources that have been canvassed in regard to the Conservatives and Conservative members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728501"> That is why I say that public policy at the national level matters. The French language today is spoken more than it ever has been, and it is because of a national government. It was a government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau that had a vision of Canada, and we are realizing the results of that vision today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728502">This is why I wanted to be able to address it by using me as an example. If only the policy would have been in place during the 1950s and going into the 1960s, I suspect I would be addressing the House in French as opposed to in English right now. I would suggest that this is why we need to be aware of the fact of what is behind the motivation and the hidden agenda of the far-right Conservative Party today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728503">That is something I would like to encourage all Canadians to get an understanding of: who it is that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is. We often talk about the cuts, and those cuts can easily be substantiated in terms of the allegations that are coming from this side, and not only from Liberals. We also see them from members of the Bloc, as well as the Greens and the New Democrats, all of whom are expressing concerns about the types of cuts the Conservative Party of Canada is actually talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728504"> I said I wanted to speak a bit about the motivation, because that is a very important aspect of why we are actually using this particular concurrence report for debate today. Look at the report itself. It is not very complicated; it is pretty straightforward. This is what the Conservative Party wanted to debate today: “That the committee report to the House its deep condemnation of the CBC using a Paris-based audio studio to record a podcast, choosing it over a Quebecois-based recording studio to avoid the Quebec accent.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728505">I share the concern that is being expressed in the report. I would like to think that all members would share in that concern, but it begs the question of why the Conservative Party would move this particular motion today. There are literally hundreds of motions on the tabling of reports that could in fact be brought forward, yet the Conservatives singled it out as the one they wanted to debate today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728506">We should ask ourselves why it is doing that. I cannot recall the Conservative Party ever, in years, using an opposition day motion to talk about the French language. If it is such an important issue, why has it not done that? It has not once that I can recall; if I am wrong, members can please stand up and let me know. I suspect I am not. Maybe 10 or 12 years ago it might have; I do not know 100%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728507">I found out just 30 minutes ago that the Conservatives have decided to talk about this particular issue, so do not try to be misled, and I say this whether to the people of Quebec or Canadians as a whole who have a passion and care about French language and want to ensure its preservation, promotion and growth. These things are not going to come from the Conservative Party of Canada; they are going to come from a continuation of Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the type of policies that we have brought forward as a Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728508">I very much want to see the Conservative Party actually take a look at how they are playing such a destructive role here on the floor of the House of Commons. It is truly amazing. In fairness to the Conservative members, I can appreciate, based on the story, that they do not really have much of a choice. They have to follow what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> tells them to do, and there are a number of quotes I can use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728509">Tomorrow is caucus day, so the Conservatives need to start holding their own <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> to account. What are we at now? It is six weeks and counting of the Conservative filibuster. The Conservatives try to pass the blame. They say to do this and do that and then we will be able to do government business. That is just not true. The filibuster is a multi-million dollar game in order to support the self-interest of the Conservative leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728510">That is what this is all about, and at the end of the day, I would suggest that we need to recognize that this is the very same <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> who orchestrated Stephen Harper's being found in contempt of Parliament. The game we are witnessing day in and day out from the Conservative Party today is not only a massive waste of financial resources but it is also preventing substantive debates from being able to occur. The leader of the Conservative Party is putting his personal interests ahead of the interests of Canadians, and that needs to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728511"> I would like to introduce an amendment. I move that the motion be subamended by deleting all the words after the words “so as to recommend that the government” and substituting the following: “expresses its deep concern for the Conservative Party of Canada's threat to cut all funding to CBC and Radio-Canada, which would leave millions of Canadians living in official language minority communities without reliable news coverage in their language of choice.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728512"> It is a good amendment and I hope all members will be voting for it. We will be watching the Conservatives in particular.</ParaText>

This contempt and denigration can be heard in a lot of places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728523">The Liberals have an odd habit. Every time official languages are mentioned in their legislation, they are actually referring to protecting minorities.

              <ParaText id="8728554"> Madam Speaker, I must return to what I was trying to do a few minutes ago through a point of order concerning the speech by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278655" Type="2">Terrebonne</Affiliation>. I think there is a connection there with today's debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728555">I found that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278383" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> took umbrage at my colleague's remarks. When she and I discussed it, we immediately agreed that this colleague was in no way targeted by the remark by my colleague from Terrebonne, who was talking more in terms of something widespread, unfortunately, that perhaps illustrated the lack of understanding there may be regarding the official language in Quebec, which is French. This is an entirely legitimate concern, and in no way does this mean that all members present in the House are not free to express themselves in the official language of their choice. We all agree on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728556">To put things in their proper context, however, it is true that for us who are working tooth and nail to defend French, Quebec's only official and common language, it can be troubling at times that members representing majority-francophone ridings are unable to speak French. It kind of shows where things stand with French and underscores the need for us to continue the fight in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728557">That being said, I have long admired my colleague from Mount Royal, with whom I sat on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. Despite our major differences, I have always managed to get along well with him to move forward on the bills we debated. This member does his work admirably in both official languages, and in that sense he does a good job of representing the constituents in his riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728558">We are talking today about the Conservatives' umpteenth attempt to discredit our public broadcaster, CBC/Radio‑Canada. We are talking about the issue of having a Canadian production translated into French in a Paris studio. For me and all my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois, and, I dare say, for all the Quebec members of the House and the Quebec cultural industry, this is so ridiculous that we actually thought it was fake news when it was first reported. At first we figured it was a mistake, that it was a podcast that had been produced abroad, translated in Paris and then broadcast on the CBC/Radio‑Canada platforms. That was not at all the case. It is totally appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728559">In this supposedly bilingual country, where we are supposedly concerned about protecting both official languages and the one that is most threatened, specifically French, how can anyone claim to be concerned if they do not even have the presence of mind to have a podcast translated in Quebec? They had something good, a good podcast, something that could be exported around the world, but since Quebeckers have a stupid accent, they would not have it translated in Quebec. Since Quebeckers have a hick accent, listeners would not understand them. They therefore decided to send it to Paris. That is why there are going to be such expressions as “du coup”, “en revanche”, “putain” and “nom de Dieu”. That is international French. It is as if Quebeckers can only have a regional accent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728560">That stems from a lack of understanding, not only of the reality of French in Quebec and Canada, but also of Quebec's cultural dubbing industry, which is one of the most professional, exacting and best in the world. Quebec's dubbing industry is exceptional. What is even more interesting and ludicrous, is that the CBC did not think it could have the production translated in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728561">Quebec can produce works in international French, or in French with the accents of Paris, Lyon, Marseille and even Pas-de-Calais if it wants to. We can produce works in French with a Spanish accent or a British accent. We can do anything in Quebec. Does anyone know why? Because we have been developing our dubbing industry for decades, and we have artists and technicians who are so specialized that major American studios often have their productions translated in Montreal because that is where they can get the best quality. Our artisans are exceptional. One would expect the public broadcaster, which claims to be exacting and an essential vehicle for culture, to be the first to know that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728562">Moreover, when the podcast was sent to France for translation and then journalists, the Union des artistes and the postproduction and dubbing sector in French got wind of it, they asked the guy at the CBC who had the brilliant idea of sending it to Paris and why he did not consider Quebec. The guy did not even know that is something we do. Well, he did know that is something we do, but he figured that no one would be able to understand the Quebec accent. That is pure ignorance and a grave insult to the exceptional work and the exceptional reputation that Quebec's dubbing industry has built over the decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728563">Nobody here remembers the production itself, which is called <I>Alone: A Love Story</I>. The title of the French version is <I>Seule: Une histoire d'amour</I>. It is an English Canadian production, made for a successful podcast platform. It would have been an extraordinary opportunity to show that we are capable of producing things here and doing them in English, in French and, eventually, in the indigenous languages. However, it was a missed opportunity, because people tied themselves in knots, thinking that it was made in English so it needed to be sent to France for the rest and then exported to the rest of the world without even considering our own reality here. It just goes to show how dysfunctional this country is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728564">It is already completely illogical for any part of a Canadian production paid for through government subsidies, tax credits or tax breaks to be created abroad. When a production receives government funding, financing or support of any kind through a provincial or federal program, there should be a requirement for every stage of production to be done right in that province, or at the very least in Canada. This should be an essential condition. If it had been, the genius who had the idea of sending this production to Paris for translation into French and Spanish would have known from the start that a Canadian production could not be sent overseas. It has to be done here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728565">A series of events occurred, which were discussed at length by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. When the current CEO, Catherine Tait, whose term is coming to a close, came to testify about this story, she offered her sincere apologies and said she was determined to ensure that such a thing never happened again. I know that the message went through. Ms. Tait listened to the concerns expressed by the committee and the House and clearly relayed them to all levels of the public broadcaster. I would be awfully surprised if we saw this type of situation crop up again in the foreseeable future. I would be very surprised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728566">People can criticize a lot of things about Ms. Tait's time as CEO. I would be the first to criticize many of the things she did. However, the Conservatives' relentless attack on her is getting a little out of control and a little unreasonable. She has become the Conservatives' scapegoat for all sorts of reasons and a pawn in their campaign to defund the CBC. That is exactly what this is about. This is yet another opportunity for them to talk about how they believe the CBC is a dysfunctional organization that does not deserve to exist and should be defunded. They are using this report from the Standing Committee on Official Languages, which rightly condemns the decision to have a podcast translated abroad, as a pretext for reiterating that the CBC does not deserve the trust of Canadians and Quebeckers and deserves to have its funding cut.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728567">I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about the importance of having a public broadcaster, especially considering the Conservatives' determination to spread disinformation and half-truths in an effort to discredit our public broadcaster. Contrary to their claims, the CBC delivers rigorous journalism, even though people may not always like it, as well as entertainment programming that is very important to Quebeckers. I do not want to speak for the anglophone side of things and what the CBC produces, because everyone knows that what Radio-Canada and the Crown corporation's francophone services produce clearly appeals more to the public and is much more popular and successful. Still, I do not want to judge the quality of the CBC's English-language programming. I am sure they produce some excellent programming as well. That said, this is yet another opportunity for the Conservatives to discredit a service that we feel is becoming increasingly essential given the present circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728568">This is a situation where we need journalists and newsrooms governed by a code of ethics and a code of conduct that require them to meet strict standards. We need a vehicle for francophone culture in Quebec and Canada. We need a company that produces high-quality, variety programming and that showcases our stories. That is the mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada. I am associating the two, but what makes it all the more offensive for francophone audiences is the fact that our stories are being translated by foreigners, based on a belief that their accent will be more acceptable to people elsewhere. This means that CBC/Radio-Canada is going to tell our stories using someone else's voice and someone else's accent. Otherwise, so they say, our stories will not be understood by others. My brief detour stops here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728569">Now, to return to the current, more general debate on the Conservatives' constant attacks on CBC/Radio-Canada, as they try to feed the beast, the monster they are trying to create in order to defund the CBC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728570">There is a big hoax here, a major flaw in the story and in their reasoning. Even if one were to get university scholars and researchers together to try to explain the Conservatives' logic here, they would not be able to do it. Surveys show that 80% of people support maintaining and protecting a healthy public broadcaster. These surveys are carried out across Canada, not just on Montreal's south shore. Canadians across the country are being asked whether they want a quality public broadcaster and whether they like CBC/Radio-Canada, and 80% of them are saying yes. Some of those people must vote Conservative. I cannot believe otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728571">Rather than realizing that they might not be on the right track, the Conservatives are assuming that most of that 80% of the people polled are from Quebec or are francophones who want to protect Radio-Canada, and so they are saying that they will make cuts to CBC's funding but save Radio-Canada. They are basically telling us they do not know anything without actually saying they do not know anything. That seems to be it, because CBC and Radio-Canada have been around for 90 years. They have been a two-headed body for 90 years. News production and editorial production are separate, but given the amount of resources that CBC and Radio-Canada share, the two have become inextricably linked. I do not know how many times that has been explained during the five committee meetings that Ms. Tait participated in just this year. The CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada appeared before the committee five times, and every time we asked her that question, she explained how and why Radio-Canada could not be separated from the CBC and how Radio-Canada would suffer enormously if funding cuts are made the the CBC. She explained that over and over in all those meetings. I do not know how many times I personally asked her that question, and every time, the answer was clear, straightforward, well-argued and complete. However, I do not think that anyone was listening. At least in this group, I do not think that anyone was listening because the Conservatives keep saying that we need to defund the CBC and that doing so will not hurt Radio-Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728572">Someone even said they would defund the CBC, but leave Radio-Canada alone. Cleary he was not listening and did not understand, because it had just been made clear that this was impossible to do. The witness just said that CBC and Radio-Canada share buildings just about everywhere in Canada. He said he wanted to cut funding for the CBC. This is one of the fine examples of populism promoted by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, who says they are going to empty the CBC offices across Canada and turn them into social housing. How can they find a simple solution to a problem they do not even understand? That is the long and the short of it. What nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728573">Again, this is just another reason today for them to go after Catherine Tait, claiming that they are going to go after the CBC and then leading people to believe that the CBC's funding has to be cut but this will have no impact on Radio-Canada. In Quebec, no one is buying it. If the Conservatives are trying to convince Quebeckers, they can keep trying. In Quebec, everyone knows that any cuts made to the CBC's funding will be disastrous for Radio-Canada and therefore disastrous for the main vehicle of francophone culture in Canada and Quebec. This will have tremendous repercussions on the cultural industry, on authors, on artists, on actors, on producers, on musicians, on singers, on everyone. No one in Quebec is buying this message, unless they failed grade two. I do not know many people who did, because we have an excellent education system in Quebec. We can discuss that another time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728574">Having said that, I find it rather absurd when the Conservatives take isolated incidents and blow them out of proportion to try to illustrate the complete failure of an organization that, on the contrary, should inspire pride—in most cases at least—because of its coverage, its presence and its efforts to reach Quebeckers and Canadians in the most remote regions, despite the constraints involved. We do consider these isolated incidents, which are not trivial, I agree. The issue of bonuses is not trivial. We need to have a conversation about the $18 million in executive bonuses. We can have that conversation. We have actually already had it, but the Conservatives were not listening because the message and the answers were not necessarily what they wanted to hear. Yes, we have had this conversation, and we must continue to have it. CBC/Radio-Canada's compensation model needs to be reviewed to ensure that it is acceptable and understood. Understanding it is another matter, but at the very least, it must be acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728575">A new mandate is likely going to be proposed by the <Affiliation DbId="300004" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> shortly. The proposed mandate would seek a review of certain parameters that guide the public broadcaster's management and operations. I look forward to seeing it. There will likely be tools in this proposal to review certain frustrating aspects of CBC/Radio-Canada. That would be good. It would not be a bad thing. We need to look at what is happening elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728576">People complain that the broadcaster is expensive and is funded by their taxes. It costs about $1.4 billion, then there is approximately $400 million in subscription and advertising revenues. That is what the public broadcaster costs. In reality, the cost per Canadian is about $32 a year. Most people pay $18 or $20 for Netflix, and they probably have other subscriptions here and there. It costs $32 a year for CBC, Radio-Canada and most of the online services they offer. To determine whether that is expensive, compare it to Germany, where its broadcaster costs $140 a year per capita, or Australia, where it costs, I think, about $47. That amount is not going to put many people on the street. Perhaps we would have a more transparent, easier-to-monitor service that is somewhat less susceptible to the populist criticism levelled by politicians like the current Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728577">I completely agree that we have to speak out against certain decisions, such as the decision to send a made-in-Canada production elsewhere for translation into French. It would be equally unacceptable for French-language productions made in Quebec or Canada to be translated abroad. We have the resources here. We have very good people here. We have to speak out against that, and that is what we did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728578">That said, I think it is disingenuous to bring this debate back to the House after a report was released. Once again, this is just an opportunity for the Conservatives to beat up on CBC/Radio-Canada and promote their agenda to defund it, which the public does not support at all. I would remind the House that 80% of Canadians want a quality public broadcaster. They want to protect it. The numbers do not lie. The Conservatives are big on numbers, so maybe they should look at the numbers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728582">Madam Speaker, I am not going to get into a discussion about the wording of amendments and subamendments, because I already take great issue with the political manoeuvring that goes on when we address this issue. For example, yesterday, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278386" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation> made a post on X in which he says, “The Bloc Québécois just voted with the Liberals to hand out bonuses, including one for the CBC president, who allowed a podcast to be dubbed in France because the CBC didn't like the Quebec accent! Once again, the BLOC is backing [the Prime Minister] and his friends, instead of Quebec.”</ParaText>

One concern I have is that with the loss of the CBC, it would take away the investigative journalism that has exposed consumer products and cover-ups, which have helped Canadians not only with public safety issues but also consumer issues related to the pocketbook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728586">What type of effect will this have? We already have a diminished investigative reporting capacity from other media outlets, and I fear that this would also take away one of the last refuges for investigative reporting that helps so many Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728587">Madam Speaker, my colleague raises a really important point. Not many news outlets have the resources to do in-depth reporting, because it involves research teams and it often takes weeks and months of work to develop these stories. I am thinking of shows like <I>Enquête</I> in Quebec and <I>The Fifth Estate</I> on CBC. These are major programs that do in-depth research, which is expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728588">Defunding the CBC means potentially depriving ourselves of these high-quality programs, which are very popular with Quebeckers and Canadians. Defunding would have a devastating effect. It would also have a devastating effect on democracy, because we need these news reports that dig deeper to clarify certain issues that are often far too complex to be explained simply in a newscast.

Perhaps Radio-Canada is more of a mainstay among Quebec's news and culture consumers than the CBC is in the rest of Canada. However, the CBC does have a number of very successful platforms. The CBC's online platforms are strong performers. The television side may be struggling a little, but the radio side is putting out excellent programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728601">Yes, it is still an essential service for Canadians living in remote regions, like the northern B.C. region my colleague represents. Everyone has the right to have access to this service, to quality service. As far as the Conservative leader's rhetoric on defunding CBC/Radio‑Canada is concerned, I am afraid he will make good on his threats. However, it is going to blow up in his face because Canadians will never let something like that happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728610">I have never been a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, but I have served as a replacement at that committee at times. I always found that the committee operated well. Its members understand the importance of the official languages and the importance of advancing the cause of language equality. The committee's work is extremely important. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of our representative on that committee, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278640" Type="2">Churchill—Keewatinook Aski</Affiliation>, who does tremendous work. She is bilingual and speaks several different languages. She is a staunch defender of the French language, both official languages and bilingualism in general.

I would like to acknowledge her work and the work of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728611">Now, the motion before us today has been amended and, at the end of my speech, I will move an amendment to the amendment. It is coming later. The committee's motion reads as follows:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the committee report to the house its deep condemnation of the CBC using a Paris-based audio studio to record a podcast, choosing it over a Quebecois-based recording studio to avoid the Quebec accent.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728613">It is true that there are no more beautiful accents in the international Francophonie than the Québécois, Acadian, Franco-Ontarian, Franco-Columbian and western Canadian francophone accents, our local accents. Wherever I travel in the world, whether it be in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America or the Caribbean, these accents have a truly magnificent reach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728614">It does not make any sense that the CBC used this Paris-based recording studio. That was a big mistake. It is only right that the committee reminded the CBC that this never should have happened. That is important because we need to be proud of our francophone heritage and our French language in Canada. No matter what the accent, whether it be Acadian, Franco-Newfoundlander, Franco-Columbian or Québécois, it is important to be proud of one's language. It is therefore important to say that this was not a good decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728615">Other CBC/Radio-Canada decisions are open to criticism, including the bonuses, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278640" Type="2">Churchill—Keewatinook Aski</Affiliation> has repeatedly pointed out. The idea of giving bonuses to senior CBC/Radio-Canada executives while cutting basic journalism and services across the country makes no sense. For the NDP, taking care of this journalism is what really matters across the country. That necessarily means investing in basic journalism. Communities need to talk to one another, whether it is in English or in French. We have witnessed the erosion of good journalism from one end of the country to the other because a growing number of big chains, sometimes foreign chains, are buying up assets in Canada and often shutting down newspapers, which is killing local radio and TV journalism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728616">Now more than ever, it is important to focus on investing at the local level, so that communities know what is going on in their own backyard. An NDP government will do just that. It will require CBC/Radio-Canada executives to invest locally in order to encourage local journalism so that, regardless of where they live in the largest democracy on the planet, people know what is going on in their community. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728617">That is important. That is why we condemn the idea that executive performance bonuses should take precedence over local journalism. We believe it should be the other way around. That is what an NDP government will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728618">Now, let us talk about Radio-Canada's qualities. Sometimes, a bad decision is made, and people are quick to say that it is not a good decision and that we need to talk about it. The fact is that Radio-Canada's journalism is something that people across the country are proud of. It has won hundreds of journalism awards not only domestically, but also internationally. Not once in my political career have I seen a single Conservative MP stand up to congratulate CBC/Radio-Canada for winning another award given out by independent judges. They have never done that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728619">What the Conservatives want is to destroy the public broadcaster. They have been very clear about that. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> says it is possible to eliminate all the services in English and eliminate all of CBC's English-language journalism, which has won hundreds of awards, without touching Radio‑Canada's French-language journalism. That is ridiculous, and it shows how little respect the Conservatives have for the average Canadian. The Conservatives are saying something that is obviously false, thinking that everyone will simply accept this falsehood coming from the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728620">Vancouver has services and several radio stations. Naturally, there is an online service that has millions of subscribers. People watch Radio‑Canada news on their computers more often than on TV. The radio is also very popular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728621">The Conservatives are saying that they are going to do away with the whole English side and that even if all of the French-speaking journalists end up on the street, they will somehow magically keep working. That is ridiculous. Radio-Canada would be wiped out in western Canada, in Edmonton, Regina, Calgary and Winnipeg. Radio-Canada would be destroyed in Atlantic Canada, in Moncton, Halifax, Saint John and Charlottetown. Everything would be wiped out and destroyed in Ontario, in Sudbury, Toronto and Windsor. All of Radio-Canada's services would be cut in Ottawa and Quebec City. Services would be cut everywhere in Quebec, including Montreal, Saguenay—Lac‑Saint‑Jean, where I lived for many years, the Eastern Townships, Sherbrooke, the north shore, the Gaspé, the Lower St. Lawrence, Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, the Outaouais and Abitibi-Témiscamingue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728622">The Conservatives are claiming that they are somehow going to magically succeed in protecting Radio-Canada while they destroy the CBC, which is completely ridiculous. It is dishonest to say that. When we look at the Conservatives' track record for the years when they were in power, we can see that they have no respect for official languages. They made no progress whatsoever for official languages at either the provincial or the federal level. When the Conservatives are in power, they destroy all of the services that are offered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728623">For a francophone who believes in official languages, voting Conservative is voting to put an end to all possible services. According to the Conservatives, these people, these taxpayers, do not have the right to any services in their language. That is what history shows. I am not talking about the stance being taken by the Conservatives because, of course, the member for Carleton will always hide his real motives, which involve major cuts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728624">If we look to the past, we can see what the Conservatives will do for official languages and for Radio-Canada once they are in power. In the past, they gave extremely generous and irresponsible gifts to billionaires. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, they gave $30 billion a year for tax havens, $116 billion in liquidity supports for Canada's big banks, and billions upon billions of dollars for CEOs. What the Conservatives do is give to the rich. That is their reason for being. The Conservative Party is a party for the rich. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation> criss-crosses the country to meet with rich people, he always asks those well-off people to donate the maximum amount in support of his pro-wealthy policies. He did so just this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728625">When we look at how the Conservatives operate, it is clear that they are very bad at managing money. They also make cuts to public services. We saw all the cuts they made. As far as pension plans are concerned, they told people that they would no longer be allowed to retire at 65, that they would be forced to work extra years. They also said they were going to cut services to veterans. They do not want these people to have access to services, even though they have sacrificed their lives and sometimes their health for our country. Of course, we also saw cuts to health care and social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728626">The member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation> brags about having built six affordable housing units in his entire career. Let us compare his career to that of the NDP leader. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> did more over the past 20 weeks than the member for Carleton did in 20 years: dental care, pharmacare, affordable housing, anti-scab legislation, and the list goes on. In 20 weeks, the member for Burnaby South did far more to help people than the member for Carleton did in 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728627">What the Conservatives did when they were in power was cut, cut, cut. They made cuts to all services so they could give money to billionaires. That is how the Conservatives operate. That is their reason for being. They are also going to make cuts to services provided in the official languages. French-speaking taxpayers will no longer be entitled to services that should exist. In a bilingual country where citizens pay taxes, people should have access to services in their own language, but no, that will not be the case with the Conservatives, because they make cuts to all services, and they will make cuts to this one too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728628">They are also going to destroy CBC/Radio-Canada. It is all based on Trumpism. It is no surprise that, in the United States, Trumpism targets good journalism and all of the award-winning journalists. This movement attacks public radio and public television so that news sources are once again concentrated in the hands of billionaires. That is the way they operate, giving everything to billionaires so that ordinary people do not have access to proper, professional news. CBC/Radio-Canada is not immune to criticism. I would not say that it is always 100% accurate, but it is possible to get an apology from the public broadcaster. Mistakes are sometimes made, but they are corrected. That is the difference. With billionaires who own newspapers and TV networks, no corrections are ever made, because the billionaires are the ones who decide on the message and on what people should hear.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728629">I think it is harmful to our democracy that Conservative members want to make cuts to all independent sources of news and ensure that a single class of people, namely billionaires, gets to tell us what to do. Francophone members of the Conservative Party from Quebec are also defending these actions and say they are ready to see CBC/Radio-Canada collapse. If they were honest with their constituents, I am sure these people would tell them that they want nothing to do with the Conservative attack on CBC/Radio-Canada, that they want quality journalism, and that when Radio-Canada or the CBC makes a mistake, they want it corrected. These people want local journalism. They want to know what is happening in their community, in their region and in their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728630">I wanted to raise this before reading my amendment to the amendment. It makes me sad to know that journalists are not appreciated.

              <ParaText id="8728631">Before reading my amendment to the amendment, I would like to say one last time to my Conservative colleagues that they need to be honest. Trump's victory in the U.S is not a sign that Canadians are going to be okay with the truth being kept from them. It does not mean that it is time to start peddling conspiracy theories and killing effective journalism to prevent Canadians from having access to the facts, the truth and information, which is so important. Canadians do not want that. They want the opposite. They want to have access to information that is based on science and facts.</ParaText>

One of the best illustrations I can think of off-hand is the Conservatives' lack of willingness to participate in political panels. The last time I participated in a CBC and CTV panel, there was a New Democratic representative, but the Conservatives do not feel they want to contribute. Rather, they discredit the mainstream media in favour of supporting social media, which is in essence spreading a great deal of misinformation through what many would suggest, including me, are further-right organizations that have a vested interest in propping up the Conservative Party or spreading misinformation.</ParaText>

We have seen this from authoritarian governments around the world. There is no independent journalism practised in Russia. Hungary saw independent journalists being attacked. We are seeing now an attack on public radio and public television in the United States with the triumph of Trumpism. The reality is that they do not respect the kind of journalism that is a vital part of democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728640">When we stand up to do a scrum, as my colleague is well aware, we get tough questions sometimes, and Canadians expect us to answer those tough questions.

              <ParaText id="8728654">The fact that bonuses are being given out is just more ammunition. People say that it is important to support local journalism. The NDP has never shied away from the topic. We have always been very clear. We want Radio-Canada and CBC to invest at the local level, we want journalism to be encouraged. Unlike the Liberal government that allows these bonuses to continue and the Conservatives who want to destroy everything, the NDP proposes a role for Radio-Canada and CBC across the country. The NDP has respect for both official languages, which the other political parties are lacking. That is a speech for another day, but when we look at the NDP governments across the country, they have always respected the official languages. That is something that is important. We are proving again today that two MPs from British Columbia can debate each other in French.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728656"> It was wonderful to hear the speech by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> and see that there are anglophone MPs from British Columbia who speak impeccable French in the House. Today we saw anglophone members from all parties who are able to manage in French in the House. This is part of Canada's richness. We have people who come from one community, learn each other's language and love each other's culture. We are trying to flourish together in a country that is much bigger than a single province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728657">As for the dubbing issue, it is absolutely shocking that CBC chose a Parisian studio to do the dubbing. There are very talented people all over Canada. There has been a lot of talk about the industry in Quebec, but there is also an industry in Acadia and other parts of Canada. There are skilled francophones throughout Canada. There has been a lot of talk about the Quebec accent, but there is not just one Quebec accent. There are many different accents in Quebec. There are also francophone accents from all over the country. I think it is completely contradictory that CBC/Radio-Canada says it wants to promote French and support Canada's various cultural institutions but chose not to use a Canadian firm for the dubbing work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728658">I, too, completely agree that CBC/Radio-Canada management has some explaining to do. I saw Ms. Tait's appearances before the committee. I would like to ask her a number of questions, not only on this matter, but on a number of other issues as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728659">There are definitely some problems with CBC/Radio-Canada management, but this institution is still very important, not only for francophone communities but also for all anglophone communities in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728660">The CBC is an institution that helps unite this country. We can go back to <I>La famille Plouffe</I> from the 1950s, a show broadcast in both French and English. That allowed Canadians from all across the country to understand what was going on across Canada, and it bridged linguistic gaps that sometimes seem insurmountable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728661">There are francophone populations in Canada. Most of them are in Quebec, but they do exist across the country. I have visited francophone communities in Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, even Saskatchewan and, certainly, here in Ontario. Radio-Canada is so important in those communities. Unlike in Montreal, where we have TVA and other networks and programs, in some parts of Canada, Radio-Canada is the only station they have.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8728662">The same is true for English-speaking Quebeckers who live outside the Montreal region. The Conservative Party's position to cut the English CBC means that English-speaking taxpayers across the country will be paying to have only the French service, not the English service. How long do we believe governments will sustain Radio-Canada when English-speaking taxpayers turn against having a network that only broadcasts in French as our national broadcaster?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728663">More importantly, while Conservatives pretend they care about the English-speaking community of Quebec, this is just one example where they clearly are not thinking of English-speaking Quebeckers. Whether it is Saguenay, Gaspé, Côte-Nord, Rouyn-Noranda or Quebec City, there are many parts of Quebec where the CBC is the primary vehicle for English-speaking Quebeckers to get local news in English. They have no other local vehicle that does that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728664">If we were to cut all of the English services of the CBC, we would be depriving the English-speaking community of Quebec, 1.3 million people, all of those who live outside of Montreal, the chance of getting their news in English. How can any party support that position? Why should we pay taxes toward denying one language community a broadcast in their own language? Then there is the question of francophones outside of Quebec.</ParaText>

It makes no sense to deprive all Radio-Canada offices outside Quebec of the vast majority of their resources. This policy should be changed. We should all be saying that Radio-Canada and CBC are important, not only for news broadcasting, but also for Canada's national unity.</ParaText>

As I mentioned, Radio-Canada services outside Quebec, where the populations are the most vulnerable, are using CBC offices, CBC cameras, CBC equipment and CBC personnel to cover the news and to do shows in French. The idea that Radio-Canada would sustain itself outside of Quebec very easily without the CBC being there is a fallacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728670">The second thing is that I do not believe English-speaking taxpayers will agree to pay for the service to be available only in French and not in English.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728685"> Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking members of the standing committee for their examination of the issue of the adaptation of CBC/Radio-Canada's audiovisual content for the international market. I would also like to thank the representatives of CBC/Radio-Canada, Ms. Catherine Tait, president and CEO, and Mr. Marco Dubé, chief transformation officer and executive vice-president for people and culture, for appearing before the committee as witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728686"> In its report, the committee reported to the House “its deep condemnation of the CBC using a Paris-based audio studio to record a podcast, choosing it over a Quebecois-based recording studio.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728687"> If we are to understand the situation, it is worth reviewing the facts of the matter. On October 11, 2023, the Journal de Montréal reported that CBC/Radio-Canada had selected a company based in France to create a French adaptation of its podcast, <I>Alone: A Love Story</I>, choosing it over a Quebec-based recording studio to avoid the recording being done in a Quebec accent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728688"> The podcast, released in 2017 and created by CBC/Radio-Canada employee Michelle Parise, has won multiple international awards and much acclaim from international press. The Paris-based studio Ochenta, in collaboration with Radio-Canada OHdio, was commissioned to adapt the Canadian podcast into French and Spanish. The decision was made in part because using a narrator with a Quebec accent would have less international potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728689">Cesil Fernandes, an executive producer at CBC Podcasts, a subsidiary of CBC/Radio-Canada's English language network, was quoted as saying, “We didn't want a Quebec French, to foster international interest... We wanted to reach out to a larger audience to tell Michelle's story. The Ochenta studio made us a pitch to translate it into French and Spanish. We decided to work with them for their experience in adaptations and to reach out to international audiences.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728690"> The article naturally led to questions, particularly in Quebec, as to why CBC Podcasts chose to ignore Quebec's expertise in the field of dubbing, and to complaints from people in the province working in the arts and cultural industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728691"> For example, Tania Kontoyanni, president of the Union des artistes, stated, “For a podcast produced and broadcast in Quebec, the narration should be done by local artists. And especially in the context of a Canadian podcast translated into French.” Similarly, voice actor Sébastien Dhavernas stated that the decision showed a “disrespect for our industry.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728692"> There are certainly Canadian studios that are able to adapt podcasts. The Journal de Montréal article mentions Quebec companies ContenuMultimedia.com and Toast Studio, for example. Indeed, CBC Podcasts has previously worked with Radio-Canada itself on the French adaptation of the podcast <I>Brainwashed</I>, which is hosted in standard French by Quebec journalist and columnist Sophie-Andrée Blondin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728693">That is the background to this issue. With that in mind, I can say that the government echoes the committee's review that CBC/Radio-Canada's use of a Paris-based recording studio for this work instead of a Quebec-based recording studio was a lapse in judgment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728694"> It is true that the decision should be taken in context. To quote the head of CBC/Radio-Canada during her testimony to the standing committee:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728695">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think it's important to know that the CBC/Radio-Canada teams produce hundreds of programs every month, thousands of hours of programming in both official languages and eight Indigenous languages. In this case, one mistake was made among the thousands of hours of programming.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728696"> Furthermore, it is also true that section 46(1)(d) of the Broadcasting Act gives the corporation the power to “make contracts with any person, within or outside Canada, in connection with the production or presentation of programs originated or secured by the Corporation.” Nonetheless, it is clear that CBC/Radio-Canada should not have acquired the services of a foreign company for this work rather than look to domestic opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728697"> What is important to remember, however, is that this mistake does not represent how CBC/Radio-Canada generally operates. CBC/Radio-Canada is a thoroughly bilingual organization. Radio-Canada is headquartered in Quebec and produces a myriad of French language programming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728698"> As Mr. Dubé noted in his testimony to the standing committee, eight members of the corporation's senior management team are francophones. That represents the majority of members. The senior management team works in English and in French at all of its meetings and makes business management decisions exercising considerable concern for balance between English and French. Half of the corporation's workforce in the organization as a whole is francophone and the other half anglophone. As Ms. Tait said, “I would dare say that we are one of the most bilingual businesses in the federal family.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728699">Even more importantly, CBC/Radio-Canada itself agrees that its original decision was a mistake. Almost immediately upon publication of the Journal de Montréal story on October 13, Catherine Tait, president and CEO, wrote to Tania Kontoyanni, president of the Union des artistes, acknowledging the error. In her letter, Catherine Tait stated clearly that “it was an error, period. We admit this unequivocally and we apologize for it....We are fortunate to have, here in Canada, an outstanding dubbing industry that works with very talented actors. We often use their services, and that is what we should have done in this case”. She also admitted the corporation's initial response to media questions was lacking in sensitivity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728700">Furthermore, she promised CBC/Radio-Canada will review its practices to ensure this sort of mistake would not occur again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728701"> At the same time, Mr. Marco Dubé, chief transformation officer and executive vice-president, contacted the association with the same message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728702"> Ms. Tait also appeared as a witness before the standing committee on November 8, 2023. During her testimony, she again apologized, not only confirming that the failure to use Canadian dubbing expertise was an unfortunate incident and mistake, but also reaffirming that the corporation's initial attempts to justify it were deplorable, hurtful and unacceptable. Ms. Tait indicated the corporation would withdraw the French episodes for the time being and re-record them. The adaptation of the podcast will be made in this country and Radio-Canada will be responsible for it. Production is already under way and the new version will be online at the beginning of the summer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728703">Ms. Tait also reaffirmed during her appearance at the standing committee that steps are being taken to ensure there will be no repetition of this sort of error. At the same appearance, Mr. Dubé, head of transformation and senior vice-president, confirmed that the issue was discussed with the teams who made the decision and that they understand the scope of their error. More specifically, the corporation has introduced measures to ensure that when CBC teams are required to interpret or translate a podcast into French, they call upon Quebec firms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728704"> It is equally important to note the reaction from the industry to this apology. “We accept the apology and pass it on to our members”, said Ms. Kontoyanni in a press release on October 13. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728705">To sum up, this was an error. CBC/Radio-Canada has taken note of it, has acted to correct it and will ensure it does not reoccur. While regrettable, this incident does not reflect on CBC/Radio-Canada's fundamental values or the work it does. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728706">I will conclude by simply quoting Ms. Tait once more:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728723">Here we are again debating what the previous member just described as an isolated incident of poor judgment at the CBC. The problem with that argument is that, increasingly, it is not simply an isolated incident of poor judgment at the CBC. It is a continual string of mismanagement, scandal and decisions that run contrary to the best interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728724">Today we are debating the CBC's decision not to support the strong bilingual nature of our country by using the homegrown talent we have, specifically in Quebec when it comes to the French language, by contracting local talent. A Canadian public broadcaster did not contract local talent because it did not want a Quebec accent on a podcast. How shameful is that? That continues a trend of mismanagement, scandal, waste and corruption that has defined the CBC in our country today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728725">We debate the amendment Conservatives have made. We do not concur in this report to send it back to be looked at further. What has become of the CBC is that it no longer represents the best interests of Canada. Over the last number of months, I have had the opportunity to be a part of the team leading the discussion on issues of heritage for the official opposition. We have seen it time and time again, as with the current CEO of CBC, Catherine Tait, and her refusals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728726">Just yesterday, in fact, I gave her an opportunity to make it crystal clear that she could show leadership to that organization by rejecting a bonus. She refused. She could show leadership by not accepting an exit or severance package as she departs the organization. She refused. In fact, it was revealed, I would suggest accidentally, because certainly it is not something to be proud of, that there is a 497K club at the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728727">For those who might be curious about what a 497K club is, it was revealed there are more than seven executives at the CBC who make more than $497,000 a year. On top of that, there is nothing to suggest it was not all of those executives who received bonuses. The average bonus was $71,000 per executive. That is at a time when Canadians are hurting. Canadians are suffering, yet CBC executives are given bonuses higher than what the average Canadian makes in a year. That is absolutely unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728728">It is not just me who thinks this. It is not just Conservatives who think this. Increasingly, we are seeing how the waste, the scandal, the mismanagement and the bloat in organizations like that are simply inconsistent with what Canadians want. There was an editorial published in The Globe and Mail. I will quote the headline because I think it is worth putting on the record: “CBC president Catherine Tait’s reign of error will not be soon forgotten”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728729">As a new CEO comes in to lead the CBC in January, there will be very simple questions that need to be asked. At the top of the list is the need to ensure that this organization is not awarding big bonuses while cutting jobs, and that it is not seeing declining revenues, declining viewership and declining trust, yet lowering its own KPIs. For those watching, KPI is an acronym for “key performance indicator”. That is what bonuses are paid out on. This is something that happens in government and the private sector. An organization will set targets known as KPIs. If those targets are met, there is a consideration of bonuses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8728730"> A number of years ago, CBC met, I believe it was, only three of 14 KPIs. That does not sound like a very good record. That does not sound like an organization that is being successful in its objectives. What happened the next year? All of a sudden, it met the majority of the KPIs. I believe it said that it met 11 of the 14.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728731">If we were to take a quick glance at that, many would say that this is great, that it is doing fantastically. It went from three to 11 in a year. How did it do that? There must be some incredible things happening. That is until we start peeling back the layers, so to speak. One might ask what those layers are. Those layers are that the CBC, instead of improving its performance, simply lowered its targets. As a result, it was not simply that these were bar graphs in a chart, which were then published, that suggested that maybe it was doing better than it was. That is a very small part of what these KPIs are. Rather, what that means is that the organization then recommended big taxpayer-funded bonuses for its managers and executives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728732">We see this trend under the Liberals. They reward themselves for failure, yet refuse to take responsibility for what has become a series of incidences of mistakes, of mismanagement, of bloat, of paying out big dollars to those who support them and their agenda. This is all while Canadians suffer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728733">When it comes to defunding the CBC, I think, increasingly, Canadians are the ones who are singing this proverbial tune. They look at the bonuses and say that this is simply not worth the cost. They look at the programming, and they are not watching the programming. It is not like this is something that is being led by Conservatives. This is Canadians choosing to not watch CBC programming. It is clear and simple. The numbers prove it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728734">At committee yesterday, the CEO explained what connected TVs were and how they just recently discovered that Canadians were able to access content in diverse and different ways. What is very interesting about that is that Canadians are not surprised about the way that they can access content. Canadians have been accessing a diversity of content, which certainly does not line up with what the CBC offers, and increasing numbers of Canadians are looking for new and creative ways to see that content, yet here we have the CBC awarding itself big bonuses, and manipulating the information and the performance indicators. If we were to look at it at first glance, we would say that it is doing great. However, it is manipulating it to look good at a time when, by any objective measure, it can only be described as failing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728735">Here we are. We have an example of that. Despite the proud bilingual history of our country, what did CBC decide to do? It decided to outsource the dubbing of the French language of an English podcast to a company from Paris. It might have even been a similar to the CEO taking a taxpayer-funded, supposed break from her holiday in Paris to go to the Olympics because she had to be there. It could also be similar to the fact that the Liberals said yesterday at committee that being paid half a million dollars to be proud of Canada is certainly worth it when it comes to those at the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728736">We see how this record of failure and decline is what defines the Liberals. The message is simple: Is it worth the cost? To those French-language artists in Quebec, who could have gotten that contract, it seems like the CBC certainly did not prioritize them. We have now heard that the CBC is now, because of that mistake, reversing that decision and going back, at a cost to taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728737">The problem with failure is that it hurts everybody. When it comes to the future of the CBC, I think Canadians are making it clearer and clearer every day that it is not worth the cost. It is time to reject the bonuses. It is time to fire the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is time to defund the CBC.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728758">I took the liberty of consulting the history books to find out what led to the creation of CBC/Radio-Canada. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> was probably around when the Report of the Royal Commission on Broadcasting was tabled in the House in 1929. I am sure he remembers it. The report was presented to the Hon. Pierre-Joseph-Arthur Cardin, Minister of Marine and Fisheries, who was responsible for telecommunications in this country at the time. The report states that “[t]he Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting was appointed by the Government to inquire into the existing situation in Canada and to examine the different methods adopted in other countries.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728759">That commission was created because nothing existed. There was no control and no way of ensuring that Canadians had access to radio waves and content. There was nothing. In 1929, the government decided to launch a royal commission of inquiry and give Mr. Aird the mandate to determine how Canadians could be better served. I will quote an excerpt from the report and I will try to make a connection with what is happening in the media sector and with regard to Radio-Canada. These are comments that were heard by the royal commission. The report says the following:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">At present the majority of programs heard are from sources outside of Canada. It has been emphasized to us that the continued reception of these has a tendency to mould the minds of the young people in the home to ideals and opinions that are not Canadian. In a country of the vast geographical dimensions of Canada, broadcasting will undoubtedly become a great force in fostering a national spirit and interpreting national citizenship.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728761">That was in 1929. Consider how the arrival of social media and the Internet has altered the state of communications today. Is that not exactly the situation we find ourselves in? What has the CBC done to foster a national spirit and sense of citizenship? Unfortunately, the CBC completely missed the boat. Just look at the CBC audience. Anyone who takes two seconds to really hear what I am saying will understand that I am talking about the CBC. We need to separate the CBC's role from that of Radio-Canada, which has been able to protect francophone culture in Canada and is still an important player in protecting that culture. I think it is important to look at what was done in the past. Later on, I will comment on an outrageous statement made by the president of CBC/Radio-Canada yesterday at the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728762">I will read two recommendations from the royal commission report at the time. It says “any broadcasting organization must be operated on a basis of public service” and that “stations providing a service of this kind should be owned and operated by one national company.” It also mentions that “[i]t is desirable...that provincial authorities should be in a position to exercise full control over the programs of the station or stations in their respective areas.” A little further it states that every province should appoint a “Provincial Radio Broadcasting Director...who will have full control of the programs broadcast by the station or stations located within the boundaries of the province for which he is responsible.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728763">Over the past few years, Radio-Canada has responded and adapted to the situation by ensuring a constant presence at the centre of Quebec culture. Unfortunately, the numbers prove it. The same numbers that Ms. Tait cited yesterday show that the CBC audience is practically in ruins. The CBC no longer plays the Crown corporation role envisaged by the Aird commission back in the day, or as the act that created the CBC/Radio-Canada said it would at the time, in the 1930s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728764">We are also here to talk about the outrageous way that president Catherine Tait has flatly refused to give up any severance pay or bonus pay at a time when the Crown corporation is no longer fully assuming its role. Unfortunately, on her watch, we witnessed different positions that showed contempt for Quebec and Quebeckers. It all started with the CBC podcast that was translated into French in Paris. That was when the full scope of the situation became clear. Why did they do that? They did it, apparently, out of dislike for the Quebec accent on the Radio-Canada side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728765">Instead of doing business with our experts and people from our culture, someone at CBC/Radio-Canada chose to have the podcast translated in Paris, supposedly because the Quebec accent was not good enough for the CBC. It was probably someone who works at the CBC, not at Radio-Canada. That set off a whole saga. Eventually, the president and CEO came to testify before the committee, where she apologized and said that such a thing would never happen again. Who did she apologize to, and what were the consequences? There were obviously no consequences, because they paid themselves bonuses. The 1,100 people at CBC/Radio-Canada who are not governed by union agreements got both raises and bonuses. That is what we learned yesterday when Ms. Tait appeared before the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728766">The translation of this podcast is a brazen attack by the CBC, so how can executives be allowed to collect bonuses, which are supposed to compensate excellence, when Canadians are suffering and cannot make ends meet at the end of the month?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728767">Unfortunately, the Bloc Québécois voted with the Liberals yesterday to defend the president and CEO of the CBC, who allowed the French-language podcast to be dubbed in France because the CBC did not like the Quebec accent. The Bloc Québécois preferred to defend the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the CBC's CEO instead of standing up and punishing her for showing such contempt for Quebeckers. The motion defeated by the Bloc Québécois read as follows:</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728769">I think the Bloc Québécois should have listened carefully to what Ms. Tait said yesterday. I asked her if she had confidence in the people at Radio-Canada to ensure continuity and take over going forward to protect Quebec and francophone culture and identity for the country. She replied as follows: As I have said many times, are we going to ask Canadians to support a federal national institution for 20% of the population? Personally, I think that is a bit much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728770">What she said was beyond the pale. It is perfectly normal for the federal government to invest in protecting francophone culture in this country. It is absolutely necessary for the federal government to ensure that the necessary funds are maintained so that Radio-Canada can continue to play its role for francophones, because it has proven, with figures to back it up, that it has done so in recent years, and it will continue to do so if it has the support. Unfortunately, Ms. Tait should understand before she leaves that it is time to put an end to this policy of rewarding poor results.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728810">Mr. Speaker, we are facing this economic threat at a time when Canada is very weak. Our economy is in free fall. Our GDP has shrunk faster than any other G7 country since the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-five per cent of Canadians are living in poverty. The cost of housing has doubled. It has increased faster than in any other G7 country. Canadian families have more debt than in any other G7 country. This is all before President Trump's tariff threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728811">We reject Mr. Trump's threats and propose an emergency debate to develop a plan that puts Canada first, a plan to protect our economy and our security. That is why we are calling for this debate. After nine years, Canadians are suffering. They can no longer cope with economic threats, especially after the damage caused by the current government here. Mr. Trump's tariffs, combined with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s taxes here in Canada, are untenable for Canadians. We need an action plan now.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8728812">Today's economic threat comes at a time of maximum economic and national security weakness. Our economy is collapsing, with the GDP per capita smaller than it was ten years ago, having dropped more than that of any other G7 country since the year before COVID. Our housing costs have doubled. Food bank use has doubled. Housing inflation has been the worst in the G7, as has household debt compared to income. Half a trillion dollars' worth of investment has poured out of our country into the U.S. Canadians already face a crippling quadrupling of the carbon tax, which by itself would send hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728813">Now, sensing weakness, President-elect Trump threatens massive tariffs on our people and our economy. Canadians will not be able to eat, to heat their home and to house themselves if they face the combination of NDP-Liberal tax hikes and American tariffs. That is why common-sense Conservatives are calling for an emergency debate to develop a plan to protect our economy and our security, a plan that puts Canada first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728814">We want a Canada first plan to defend our people. We as a Conservative team ask for the Speaker's approval to hold the debate as early as tonight.

It is very clearly laid out that we have individual privileges and rights as members, but the House has collective rights as well, and a key one is demanding the production of papers.

That should be concerning to all members and all Canadians, because while in this case the Liberals might not like what the motion says, might quibble with what will happen with the documents and might try to hide behind the fig leaf of technicality, what they do when they undermine the supremacy of the House, the rights and privileges of the House, is they give license to a future prime minister to do it again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728852">If the Liberals say they will not accept the rights and privileges of the House of Commons and the motions it passes, a future prime minister will simply give the back of his hand to the House and decide that he or she alone knows better. We do not have that kind of system. The Prime Minister is supposed to be the servant of the House, not its master, and for too long the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has believed that he is above members of Parliament on both his side and this side. We have seen the evidence of that, with dozens of his own members wishing he would take a walk in the snow. It snowed a bit today, so hope springs eternal, but we know what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thinks of his own caucus. Certainly, we know what he thinks of the motion that has been passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728853">What are the Liberals protecting? Why have they gone to such lengths that for three months they have held up the work of the House by refusing to obey an order of the House? It must be pretty bad. Those documents must be worse than the $58 million going to 10 projects for Liberal insiders and the $334 million of questionable projects going to board of director members with conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728854"> We know that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> has been implicated in this as well, having lobbied for a project while he was outside of cabinet and having received benefits while he was in cabinet. That is the record of the government. The Liberals are hiding the documents after saying that they would have the most open and transparent government in history. The only thing open is the chequebooks for Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728855"> It is like an open bar if someone is a Liberal insider. They get access to government contracts. One member, one of whose names I could say because he has another name, has resigned from cabinet finally after fighting it. It is the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. We saw what he was willing to do to get his hands on government money from his Liberal friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728856">We are calling once again on the government to respect Parliament, to respect the vote that was held in Parliament in June, to respect the ruling of the Speaker that was issued in September and to respect the months of debate that have been happening in the House. It is clear that we will not go quietly into the night. We will not let this be shuffled off to some committee where the government can get its allies in the other parties to quietly bury it, as happens every day in the House when Conservatives bring forward motions. Behind closed doors at committee, they are quietly shuffled off and voted down or watered down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728857"> This has to be decided here, because the vote happened here and the Speaker's ruling happened here. This can all go away if the government simply listens to the will of Parliament and respects its rights and privileges. We need to get back to the work that we have been called here to do. We believe that the government is imperiling our economy. We need to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the deficit, fix the budget and stop the crime. Those are our priorities, but our number one priority is ensuring that the House is respected, that the Speaker is respected, that Parliament is respected and that the government does the right thing and the lawful thing. It must turn over the documents today so we can get back to doing the people's business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728866">Mr. Speaker, I remember when Stephen Harper was found in contempt of Parliament, the only prime minister ever found in contempt. He was found in contempt over an issue very similar but much more serious, the Afghan detainee documents. Allegations had been made that Canada was involved in turning over what often turned out to be low-value suspects for torture and intimidation, in violation of the Geneva Convention. Stephen Harper ignored Parliament, refused to turn over the documents and then prorogued Parliament and shut down the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728867">In this case, which is about turning over documents, the Speaker ruled that this matter should go to the PROC committee. I trust that members of the committee are going to make a decision about whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is in contempt. However, to me, the real contempt of the House is that despite a ruling to send this to committee, the member who lives in the 19-room mansion Stornoway has shut down our work as parliamentarians, interfering with our rights and privileges. Meanwhile, the Trump agenda is rolling on, and we are sitting here as a broken democracy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8728886"> I am completely amazed at what I see happening in Canada. In fact, I have people reach out to me every day.

              <ParaText id="8728887"> The question of privilege that we are talking about today is indicative of the things that the Liberals have done and the fact that they are not overly concerned about the rule of law and about dividing people. They have divided people in a number of different areas. When I look at what happened this weekend and if we asked anyone in the House or any guests in the gallery if they ever thought they would see this as part of their Canada, if anyone would have said they saw it coming, I do not think it was on the bingo card for 2024. It shows the government's lack of respect and how it does not treat these kinds of things seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728888">When we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is the great divider, who divides us on race and a whole bunch of issues, vaccine status being one of these things, who calls everyone a racist who does not agree with the government's policies or the concerns people have raised, it should be troubling. It should be troubling for Canadians to see such a lack of leadership. It is indicative of what is happening and what we are talking about today with respect to these documents. I know the last time I talked about these documents, I talked about the Winnipeg lab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728889"> However, my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278493" Type="2">Chilliwack—Hope</Affiliation>, said it best. We have an order of the House requesting that these documents be produced, and the government tells us not to worry about it, that it will give us some redacted documents that it thinks we need to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728890"> I am reminded of what happened with the Winnipeg lab in 2021. The government said that there was nothing to see there and not to worry about it at all because it was handling it. What did we see happen in Winnipeg? Dangerous vials were being sent by FedEx to China. If we want to talk about a government that is out of control, a government that has something to hide, it is the government on the other side and what it has done over the last nine years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728891">Let us review a bit of what has happened, and I know my colleagues have talked about this before. We are talking about the $400 million and how that was handled. Members in the House have accusations against them. We have the two Randys story. We are not really sure where that is at moment. We have other ministers who have been involved possibly. The people in the gallery should think about this for one second. Their taxpayer dollars were sent to the government. They were then funnelled back to the Liberal Party of Canada. I wonder how that makes people feel? I know it does not make me feel very good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728892"> Our job here is to represent our constituents. When I think about that, I think of the $400 million now. I think of the sponsorship scandal. In fact, we have had so many scandals over the last nine years, I do not think I would have time in my 20 minutes to go through all them. When we are talking about one, another one drops off and we forget about the things that happened before. It is our job to remind voters of how incompetent the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is at handling our economic affairs, not to mention our GDP per capita and the fact we are going to be at the bottom of the OECD countries over the next 20 to 30 years. We have a worse GDP than Mississippi.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728893"> All of these things are incredibly troubling when we think of all the great resources, abilities, people and talent we have in our country.

              <ParaText id="8728894">When we look at what went on with the green slush fund, we find that a number of policies were not followed. Those policies were set in place so that people would not take advantage of the system. I know some of these numbers have been mentioned before, but we need to continue to talk about them. When we look at what one audit found, there were 10 ineligible projects for almost $60 million, along with 96 cases where conflict-of-interest policies were not followed for $75 million. The list goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728895"> There were just under 200 conflicts of interest, where, once again, people with the inside track were able to take money from taxpayers and use it for their best interests. The Liberals say that we should not to worry about, that there is nothing to see. It is our job as parliamentarians to ask those questions and to get to the bottom of it. It is our job to request documents and not have them redacted, so we can see what went on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728896"> The reason I say that is because we saw what went on before, such as with the Winnipeg lab. If we think about it, we had researchers in Canada who were working for the Chinese Communist Party. People who were trusted were working in a level 4 laboratory. When we requested documents, coincidentally just before the election, the Liberals basically said that we did not need them, that it was not our concern, that we did not need to worry about it. To me, that is very troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728897">If we look at what happened with the Winnipeg lab and if we look at what is going on with the SDTC, it gives us an indication of some of the challenges we are having with the economy. I am talking about where we are right now when it comes to GDP per capita.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728898"> The other challenge we have right now is that small businesses are hurting. Small businesses help create jobs in our country. I have a number articles in front of me. If we look at them, Canadian businesses are struggling big time. Business closures are up almost 5% over historical averages. Business openings are down 4.5%, below historic averages. The number of active businesses that are down are over 2,000. Business failures went up in 2023. Small businesses have had the highest numbers of insolvency in the last 36 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8728899"> Small businesses have never recovered from the pandemic. They took on additional debt. Two or three small businesses took additional pandemic debt.

That is not just a statistic; it is a stinging indictment of the Liberal government’s failed justice system. Its soft-on-crime approach is failing people in my community.

By making many essential goods GST and HST free, we will be delivering meaningful savings for Canadians with real relief at the cash register.</ParaText>

It is almost as though we do not recognize this Canada that we have anymore. I believe this is a direct result of the policies of the Liberal government and how its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation> has been dividing people. Quite frankly, it is very troubling to see what happened on the weekend and the amount of destruction. The government had no problem freezing peaceful protesters' bank accounts before.

              <ParaText id="8729213">We have a government that has wasted $400 million when small businesses are suffering and crime is out of control. The government is doing anything but leading in this country. This is affecting how small businesses can prosper and whether they are going to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729214">I am going to share a couple of quotes that are talking about security. The first says, “Some security measures, while helpful and necessary, may come at a steep price, deter customer foot traffic and, as a result, lead to lower revenues”. The second reads, “Many businesses are already operating on thin profit margins, so just one crime incident could be make-or-break-for a small business owner.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729215">Small businesses are watching as the Liberals are paying out of this $400 million slush fund to enrich themselves versus actually doing something for small businesses, such as setting policies or dealing with crime issues that would help businesses do a better job and be more prosperous. The CFIB report notes that businesses have adopted their operations in response to crime. About 50% have implemented safety measures that alter customer access, like locking doors or requiring appointments, and 67% resorted to spending money on more security. However, these measures have also made it more challenging for customers to access stores, potentially reducing foot traffic and revenue. I could talk more about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729216">I talked about how difficult it is for small businesses. Once again, the Liberals have money for all their pet projects without setting proper policies in place that would ensure investment comes to Canada. We could attract investment and make sure that we are doing it. We can look at what is going on with our small businesses. I talked about how closings are up, openings are down and the number of businesses shutting down have grown.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278214" Type="2">Mr. Dan Albas (Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8729266"> Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to stand here on behalf of the good people of Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729267"> Before I begin, I would like to remind the House why privilege is important. Privilege goes to the very core of how we as elected officials do our job and hold the government to account. It encompasses both the rights and the immunities that every member of the House requires to fulfill our duties as parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729268">In a democracy, it is the people, not the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and not his increasingly insular office, who must prevail. If powerful unelected individuals can prevent us from doing our job, the people become powerless. Let us never forget that in Canadian democracy, it is Canadians who elected their representatives to be their voice in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729269"> The current debate has become lengthy, but I can summarize it effectively. The Prime Minister's Office claims, “There is nothing to see here.” The Liberals accuse the opposition of holding Parliament hostage, and they blame us entirely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729270">Let us recap the facts. The Liberal government appointed the people who ran the SDTC program. They had full control and knowledge of what was happening, and yet it was whistle-blowers, not the government, who exposed the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729271"> The Auditor General has since confirmed the disturbing extent of fiscal corruption. Consider the audacity of being entrusted with scarce public dollars and then funnelling them into their own company. What kind of culture enabled such corruption? To every member on the government side, I say that if they believe this conduct is acceptable, then they should think again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729272">Consider the audacity of being entrusted with scarce dollars funnelling into their own companies. I just want to impress upon members that we would never allow this in a private corporation or a not-for-profit organization that we were part of. Why would we allow it in a case like this? As Lord Acton famously observed, “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729273">Once exposed, the Liberal government ended the program, and now it wants to sweep everything under the rug. “Nothing to see here”, it says; “trust us.” Well, Canadians remember when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> looked them in the eye and declared that the allegations in the Globe and Mail story that morning were false. Later those allegations proved to be true and accurate. The only accountability in that sort of affair was the punishment of former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould for refusing to believe in the Prime Minister's Office and its corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729274">So many times when a scandal erupts, we hear the usual excuses from the Prime Minister's Office and from ministers. First comes denial, then comes leaked truth, and then the ministers did not know, because ministers, particularly Liberal ministers, never seem to know, do they? When powerful Prime Minister's Office insiders or ministers appear at committee hearings, their standard response to tough questions is “I do not recall.” It is not a denial, but it is convenient should the truth emerge. Is this fulfilling the public trust?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729275"> Let us return to the privilege motion frankly. The Prime Minister's Office controls which documents are released and redacted, and yet it has the audacity to say, “Trust us.” Why would anyone trust the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or his PMO, given their track record of deception? How do we break the impasse? Fortunately, we have parliamentary privilege or a production order, a tool that allows us to demand all documents, unredacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729276">If there is truly nothing to hide, an innocent government should welcome the opportunity to prove it. Who would not, unless there is something to hide, something the Prime Minister's Office does not want Canadians to know? Would the PMO openly admit it is hiding something? No, of course it would not. It needs an excuse, which is precisely why it has invented the creative fiction of hiding behind the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729277">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office have lived in their bubble for so long, isolated in an echo chamber, that they have lost touch with reality. To many Canadians, the charter argument suggests that powerful Liberal insiders have a constitutionally protected right to misuse taxpayer money. Why else would the Liberals continue stonewalling?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729278"> Before the government benches raise their predictable objections, let us ask this question: Is there a better way? As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> once said, “better is always possible”. Let us discuss how the process could work better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729279">Some of my colleagues were here during the issue of former senator Mike Duffy. The opposition then, as now, wanted facts and accountability. That is after all one of our core duties, except for the NDP opposition, which seems to blindly support the Liberal government at every turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729280">Regarding Senator Duffy, former prime minister Harper faced two choices. He could have hidden behind privacy laws, solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence, exactly as today's Prime Minister's Office does, to withhold unredacted documents. Instead, having nothing to hide, he did what an honourable prime minister would do; he waived all privileges and instructed his office to share every document. That is what an accountable, transparent and honest government looks like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729281">Interestingly enough, while the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has mentioned his predecessor's name nearly 300 times in the House, he has never once mentioned this example of integrity. To my friends on all sides of the chamber, this shows that better is always possible and shows how the Liberal government could improve. It should choose transparency and accountability, but we know that the Prime Minister and his PMO will not take that path. They will not even consider it. Why is that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729282">Imagine that, if by some miracle, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> releases all documents unredacted, as the order states, and gives them to the law clerk, who transfers them to the RCMP. If there is truly nothing to hide, we resume business. However, if there is something hidden, someone might face accountability somewhere. In the dark world of Liberal back rooms, who that someone might be makes all the difference. I do not believe, and I doubt many government members truly believe, these things happen by accident with nobody's knowledge. Someone knew, and that someone is being protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729283">Meanwhile, Parliament's work stalls, and one of our most important tools, the production order, is being trampled on. This is not the first time the government has tried to usurp a production order. Remember how it attempted to take the Winnipeg lab production order to the courts, in a case that became moot when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> used his COVID-era powers in summer 2021 to dissolve Parliament, all in the pursuit of a majority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729284">What we have here is that instead of resorting to the courts as it did in 2021, the government has chosen to stonewall the House. Is protecting potentially guilty parties worth defying and ultimately sacrificing an honoured ancient tool of Parliament? Some on the government side apparently think so, or we would not be here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729285">Consider this. If we in the opposition did as the Liberal government asks, simply trust it and move on, nobody would face accountability. Taxpayer dollars would vanish, wealthy insiders would have profited without any consequence, and the people responsible would escape judgment. That is exactly what the government proposes in order to avoid exposing its program mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729286">Does anyone believe this represents good governance? Did the people on the Liberals' side seek office to protect the people who abuse public trust and profit from taxpayers? I would like to believe that none of them did. Certainly no one on this side did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729287">As we approach what the Liberal government calls the holiday tax break, or what the Toronto Star calls the “shameless giveaway plan” that is “incoherent, unnecessary, and frankly embarrassing,” my inbox fills with concerns from small businesses about lack of consultation and information. Like so many Liberal government initiatives, it emerged seemingly from nowhere. The messaging is almost comical. Are expensive gaming consoles really essentials? Promoting more consoles means parents face pressure for costlier Wi-Fi plans. This is great for Canada's wireless cartel, but terrible for struggling families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729288">I have one final thought. In my riding, constituents accidentally overpaid the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, CERB, and had every dollar clawed back by the CRA. Others deemed ineligible faced the same, yet what about the people who received SDTC funding through conflicts of interest or whose projects were totally ineligible to receive the money in the first place? Will these people who obtained millions of dollars face similar clawbacks, or do the Liberals believe that these individuals and their companies deserve impunity?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729289"> Why does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> maintain double standards? Why do his expectations for others not apply to him and to other Liberal insiders? Consider his message: millions of dollars in tax dollars for friends who wrongly benefit, while the average Canadian gets $250 of their own money back. That is an attempt to distract from what has happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729290">Canadians deserve accountability and transparency. Whatever happened to the idea that sunlight is the best disinfectant, or, as I said earlier, to “better is always possible”? Those were supposed to be core principles; “open by default”, he said. Instead we get scandals, corruption, stonewalling and efforts to hide truth from Canadians. This is wrong. Deep down, every member knows it is wrong. We must send the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his PMO a clear message: enough. The people responsible for the SDTC program's failures must face accountability, full stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729291"> I call on all members to stand united against corruption and concealment of the truth from Canadians. We should protect our privilege, in this case the tool of a production order. The government should square up to the fact that, whether Liberals likes it not or not, a vote was held, a division was made, a decision was cast by each member here, and the majority demanded an ancient right, something that the government cannot ignore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729292">A government is not separate from its people. A government is not somehow above the fray of Parliament. In our Westminster system, the government is fused with the legislative assembly. Those people are here and are meant to be accountable to us, those of us who do not sit in cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729293">The rest of the members in this place have a duty and an obligation to hold the government to account. I do not care whether members do so in the open, like I am doing right now. I do not care whether it is done at a caucus meeting with other people inside the same party. However, my goodness, we owe this country and this institution better than what they are getting right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729294">It is easy I guess for me to get on my high horse and say that all of us should be like white knights coming to the rescue. However, if we do not, who will? If the government does not learn the lesson that it is chained to this place, that when a production order is made it must respect it. If we do not defend that as members of Parliament if the government does not agree with it, then the solution is to either hold the line or vote the government out. When I talk about a carbon tax election, many of my constituents have said that to me, and some of them were former Liberal supporters. They get the sense that nothing can be changed in this place unless we change the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729295">Therefore the government has a tough question to answer its own members of the Liberal caucus: Do they respect the institution and bring forward the production order in its entirety, whether or not they agree with it, or do they simply say no and let their names in their communities get dragged through such that people believe that they are not there to do what they asked?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729296"> I am not asking everyone to agree with me all the time. I am just saying that on this one we have to have a line in the sand that we and others who have come before us have drawn, and not allow the issue to go any further. I ask all hon. members to hold the line with me and with other members to make this place a place that governments respect, or they will find that this place will be diminished, and it will be because of their inaction. Again, this is about something bigger than us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729297">Members may suggest we are wasting money by talking about what has made this institution great, but we can never put a price tag on democracy. They say we are wasting money by talking something that does not matter, but it does matter. This place has a foundation. If a person sees the foundation of their home start to crumble and they do nothing, that is an act of omission. If they do as the government is doing and bring a sledgehammer to that foundation, that is an act of commission. Both are wrong because eventually the house falls and everyone suffers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729298">I am more than happy to be accountable to my constituents. I am happy to answer questions on why I made these statements. I believe my constituents are firmly behind me on this one, as I have asked them multiple times if we should continue to hold the line. I will warn members in the governing party that people are starting to say the only way this ends is by an election and a new government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729299">The members can get to their microphones tomorrow, talk to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and tell him to stop this sledgehammering of an institution we all care about.</ParaText>

Some may have some concerns about what was spent during the COVID period, where we went from an average budget under Mr. Harper of around $250 billion to, in some cases, topping $700 billion in a single-year budget. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729335">Today, I am adding my voice regarding the subamendment to the privilege motion relating to the Auditor General's findings. These revelations indicate that Liberal insiders at Sustainable Development Technology Canada allocated nearly $400 million in taxpayer money to their businesses, resulting in over 186 conflicts of interest. I am frustrated that, at a time when many Canadians are struggling to afford necessities like food, heating and housing, we are forced to repeatedly confront ongoing corruption within the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729336">SDTC was a federal foundation that was supposed to support small and medium-sized businesses in the clean-technology sector by funding projects that work to develop technology that benefits the environment. The Liberals would ask was SDTC not started by the Conservatives. It absolutely was. In 2017, it received a clean bill of health from the Auditor General when that audit was done. What went so wrong between 2017 and 2023? The Liberal government appointed Liberal insiders to the board of Sustainable Development Technology Canada who violated conflict of interest laws and turned SDTC into a slush fund for Liberal elites. Everything the Liberals seem to touch becomes embroiled in corruption and scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729337">In light of the alarming discoveries about the mishandling of these funds, the Auditor General launched an investigation into the green slush fund and the awarding of contracts since 2017. What she found is that Liberal insiders were funnelling taxpayer money into their own companies to the tune of $400 million. Let us keep in mind that is just what she audited. She did not audit the entire workings of this fund, so who knows how many other millions of dollars have been misappropriated by these insiders? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729338">What makes things worse is the fact that Cycle Capital, a company the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> was a lobbyist for, was given $10 million from the green slush fund. This funding was approved by a board member who also had shares in this company and is a close friend of that minister. Not only that, she has admitted to the committee that several of her other companies received millions of dollars from the green slush fund while she sat on the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729339"> In addition to the $400 million lost and the 186 conflicts of interest, the Auditor General's report contains findings that paint a picture of Liberal incompetence, disregard for the law and a lack of respect for public funds. The Auditor General's report found that the Liberal-appointed directors of the green slush fund “did not ensure that the foundation complied with its enabling legislation.” In other words, the Liberal-appointed board of directors did nothing to make sure they followed the law when awarding millions of taxpayer dollars to companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729340">What is even more outrageous is that the report specifically states that the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> did not sufficiently monitor the contracts and failed to fulfill his obligations to assess any conflicts of interest with respect to the green slush fund. I really wonder how on earth the minister failed to monitor contracts containing 186 conflicts of interest. He did not just not monitor one contract, but failed to do it 186 times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729341">In addition, the assistant deputy minister from that minister's department called the green slush fund “free money”, saying, “there's a lot of sloppiness and laziness, and there's some outright incompetence, and the situation is...untenable at this point”. What a glowing review after nine years of the NDP-Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729342"> It is simply outrageous that, for a fund dedicated to supporting the development of new sustainable technology, $59 million of this green slush fund went to 10 ineligible projects. To quote the Auditor General, these projects, “did not support the development or demonstration of a new technology, or the projected environmental benefits were unreasonable.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729343">Not only was taxpayer money misappropriated by Liberal insiders, but it was also given to projects not even relevant to the goals of the fund. Even worse, the Auditor General estimated that during the time the audit was taking place, one in 10 new projects approved were also ineligible for funding. It is unfathomable that Liberal insiders continued to misappropriate funds, despite being under active investigation by the Auditor General for that very crime. Ultimately, it is clear these findings by the Auditor General are very serious, and Conservatives believe Canadians deserve to know the full extent of this Liberal corruption. That is why, on June 10, Conservatives put forward a motion calling for all documents related to the green slush fund to be tabled within 30 days and then turned over to the RCMP. This motion passed in the House, despite the Liberals' desperate attempts to vote it down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729344">It is worth noting that the motion that was passed by the House is binding. It is not just a mere suggestion, and it is certainly not optional. The Liberals responded to this motion on July 17, August 21 and September 16, but tabled only partial disclosures, owing either to redactions or to the withholding of documents. In other instances, the House order was met with a complete refusal. According to the Speaker's own ruling, the law clerk reported that the Liberals had not complied with the House order by the stipulated deadline of 30 days following the adoption of the motion. In response to the Liberals' refusal to disclose the documents, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> raised the question of privilege, arguing the House's powers to order the production of documents should be absolute and the government cannot disregard this binding order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729345">As parliamentarians, we have a right to ask for any documents to be produced that are necessary for us to fulfill our duties to Canadians. Therefore, on September 26, the Speaker ruled that the Liberals' failure to produce documents relating to the green slush fund scandal constituted a prima facie breach of privilege and as such, all debates are suspended until this matter is resolved. We are sitting here five months after and are continuing to debate this because the conditions of the opposition motion passed by the House in June have not been met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729346">Today, we are debating the subamendment put forward by my colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278460" Type="2">Calgary Rocky Ridge</Affiliation>. The subamendment states that once this motion has passed through the House, the committee studying this question of privilege must report back to the House within 30 sitting days, unless the government tables all of the documents fully unredacted before that time. This Conservative subamendment ensures Canadians can get the answers they deserve in a timely manner. I want to be clear: we are not the ones who decided that Parliament had to debate this privilege motion, paralyzing other business in the House. It is the Speaker who ruled that the government violated the privilege of the House. It was the Liberal government that decided not to abide by the motion passed by the House and to ignore the Speaker's subsequent ruling. This is why we are continuing to debate this motion. It was not the Conservative Party's decision. It was the decision of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729347">There is a troubling pattern with these Liberals. Repeatedly, vital information is withheld from Canadians and the official opposition. The government obstructs Conservatives from accessing information regarding fiscal mismanagement and scandals. Canadians have a right to know precisely how their money is being spent. According to the Speaker's own ruling, “The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any...documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties.” He continues, “The House has clearly ordered the production of certain documents, and that order has clearly not been fully complied with.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729348">If the Liberals have nothing to do with this $400-million scandal, they should be as concerned as the rest of us about this gross waste of taxpayer money, and fight to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Instead, they have violated parliamentary privilege, preventing us from fulfilling our duties to Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729349"> Parliamentary privilege is the individual and collective right that we as members of the House of Commons have, which allows us to effectively carry out our principal functions to legislate, deliberate and hold the government to account. In Canada, parliamentary privilege is part of our Constitution, as it is essential for maintaining the power and authority of the House and allowing members of Parliament to represent their constituents fully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729350">The House of Commons is an institution that represents the voice of the people. We cannot legislate, speak or make decisions on behalf of the Canadian people if we do not have a full picture of any given situation or do not have the freedom to speak freely about any given topic. This is why parliamentary privilege is so important. It provides parliamentarians with the rights and freedoms necessary to do our jobs. When parliamentary privilege is breached, it means that the government has disregarded and broken the constitutionally guaranteed right of parliamentarians. This question of privilege goes beyond Liberal corruption. It is about preserving the integrity of the institution of Parliament. Nobody in this country is above the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729351">On October 4, RCMP Commissioner Duheme confirmed that there is an ongoing investigation into the green slush fund. It is shameful. The Liberals think they can obstruct an RCMP investigation by withholding these documents, using a flimsy argument that such a motion calls for the documents to be turned over to the RCMP, thereby making the motion inadmissible. In the Speaker's ruling, he agreed that “It is indeed unusual, novel and unprecedented for the House to order documents not for its own purposes but for a third party.” However, the Speaker also added, “I believe the best way for this to be achieved would be to follow the usual course for a prima facie question of privilege...”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729352">It is both unusual and unprecedented for the RCMP to have to investigate a government regarding such a significant number of conflicts of interest and misappropriation of funds. It is perplexing for a government that asserts it is not accountable for this scandal, and to take such extensive measures to conceal the truth rather than advocating for Canadians to uncover what really happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729353">By failing to comply with the production order, the message to the Canadian public is clear. The Liberals are complicit in this wrongdoing and corruption and have something to hide. That is how it would appear to the public. The RCMP must have access to the full, unredacted documents ordered by the House so that they can investigate the corruption that has been all too common under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729354">The Liberals are raising concerns that the Speaker's order could infringe on the charter right specifically regarding police investigations and privacy but let us be clear. It is the Liberals who are abusing their power by refusing to comply with an order of the House. They claim that we are the ones violating, or potentially violating, section 8 of the charter, which safeguards privacy against unreasonable search and seizure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729355">However, the reality is that there is minimal, if any, expectation of privacy regarding these documents. They were generated by public servants, using taxpayer funds, and are therefore the property of the public. Contrary to claims made by the Liberals, advocating for transparency does not undermine privacy or due process. Instead, there is a demand for accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729356">The House order does not force the RCMP to take any specific action on the documents. Having served in law enforcement for 35 years, let me explain the way these investigations could work. A complainant generally turns over the documents to the police to investigate. The government is not acting like a complainant in this matter. It is acting more like an accused. The government has a responsibility to turn over evidence to law enforcement and let the evidence dictate the best course of action by law enforcement and the justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729357">However, for some reason, the Liberals have completely refused to provide Canadians with the answers they rightfully deserve, actively obstructing a criminal investigation into the misappropriation of funds. Are they worried about what the RCMP might find? It certainly appears that way. Do they actually believe Canadians will not see right through that?</ParaText>

If the Liberals are saying that Liberal insiders, ministers and those in government have nothing to do with what is going on in this corruption, then they should have no issue with turning over unredacted documents to the RCMP. They should do that on their own. The other thing is this: If the Liberals are protecting someone who is inside, they should absolutely be concerned.

              <ParaText id="8729372"> The Conservative leader decided to muzzle those members and prevent them from doing their job by requesting funding that is there to help alleviate the housing crisis.

              <ParaText id="8729383">We can go through dozens of examples in which it has taken advantage of and completely wasted hard-earned taxpayer money. SDTC is an example of that. It had a board already pre-selected early on; surprise, it was full of Liberal insiders. If that does not raise alarm bells, then people are asleep over there. Obviously, they have been, as indicated by the 186 conflicts of interest that the minister did not even recognize with their own board members and their own companies that did not belong to any sustainable fund, fund priorities or goals of this fund. This reeks and smells of criminality to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729384">I would hope that the government, as much as it is trying to protect itself from this and from the embarrassment, will see that the Canadian public thinks it is complicit in this because of the fact that it is stonewalling the release of documents.

I found that troubling, and my constituents feel exactly the same way. Scandal after scandal shows the absolute and utter disregard for the Canadian public.

              <ParaText id="8729387"> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak about our oh-so-beloved Liberal government and, more specifically, about the problem that we have been discussing for several weeks now, namely the infamous $400 million that was diverted to Liberal cronies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729388">Those funds came from a program that worked flawlessly from 2001 to 2016 or 2017. What happened at that point? There was a change of government. All of a sudden, the Liberal government did what it usually does and started rewarding its cronies. That is why we have a major issue with the $400 million that has gone missing. The money that disappeared into the pockets of Liberal friends is our money. What does that tell us? It tells us how little interest the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has in financial matters, although we have known that for quite a while now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729389">It also tells us that he has little interest in security matters. Last week, we saw a telling example of how the Prime Minister handles situations that people in Canada are experiencing. On Friday, things got intense in Montreal. Protesters started smashing things in front of the convention centre, where a NATO Parliamentary Assembly meeting was taking place, attended by members of the association I belong to. Meanwhile, what was the Prime Minister up to? The Prime Minister was dancing in front of Taylor Swift.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729390">He was playing with his little bracelets while Montreal was burning. This is a powerful symbol that proves the Prime Minister does not act like an adult, let alone like a prime minister. Violent, destructive riots have been going on in Canadian communities for months now. Instead of taking action, the Prime Minister did not even take a few minutes' break from dancing the night away to issue the following statement:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729391">

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> What we saw on the streets of Montreal last night was appalling. Acts of antisemitism, intimidation, and violence must be condemned wherever we see them. The RCMP are in communication with local police. There must be consequences, and rioters held accountable.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729392">That nice tweet was posted on his page. He probably did not even see the message before his staff posted it. That brief message was posted on X, so he figured his work was done and he could keep dancing and having fun. Everyone saw the pictures. It was really something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729393">Some will say that the Prime Minister has the right to go and see a concert with his daughter. Of course, but the Prime Minister has a fundamental responsibility. When a major incident happens in the country, he has a duty to stop having fun himself and tell his daughter to keep going with her friends. He should then go and see what is happening and deal with the situation. That is not what happened. We know the Prime Minister has the resources. He has his security team by his side. He has a command post. He can visit in person to see what is going on and decide what needs to be done. Instead, he simply carried on having fun, as though nothing had happened. For the past nine years, the Prime Minister of Canada has been perceived as someone who is not serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729394">Terry Glavin from the National Post said the same thing in October. Referring to groups that are causing problems in Canada, he wrote, and I quote, “Such hateful rhetoric is unacceptable. This has no place in Canada. All options must be considered. This is not who we are. We are treating this with the utmost urgency.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729395">As Mr. Glavin writes, “For more than four years, this is what we have been hearing from the Liberal government about the bloodcurdling incitements that are the stock in trade of the Vancouver-headquartered Samidoun Network, the overseas agitation and propaganda wing of the terrorist-listed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729396">According to a newspaper article, in August, the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> stated that federal departments are currently examining how two men suspected of having ties to a foreign terrorist group were allowed to enter Canada and, worse still, to obtain Canadian citizenship. Ahmed Fouad Mostafa Eldidi, 62, and his son Mostafa Eldidi, 26, were arrested in Richmond Hill, Ontario. They face nine separate terrorism charges, including conspiracy to commit murder on behalf of the Islamic State, a terrorist group. The RCMP announced the charges and said the two men were in the advanced stages of planning a serious, violent attack in Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729397">What I just read out is an example of the government's incompetence. Videos clearly show this man committing barbaric acts with the armed group Islamic State. He came to Canada and became a Canadian citizen.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729398">How can the United States trust Canada when Canada gets into situations like these? That is just one example among many. The Americans are very nervous, and rightly so. Just think: Canada let in a member of the Islamic State who then became a Canadian citizen. There is even video evidence to support it. No one can wrap their heads around it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729399">In July, the National Post reported that U.S. senator Marco Rubio and his colleagues had sent a letter to the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, urging him to beef up precautions along the Canada-U.S. border. Why? It was because Canada had recently increased the number of refugees allowed to enter the country on temporary resident visas from Palestinian territories, including Gaza and the West Bank. The letter cited concerns that this would allow Gazans with possible ties to terrorists to enter the U.S. via Canada. With so few reliable records or background checks available, Canada's decision will turn the northern border into a much bigger national security issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729400">All of the Liberal government's decisions bring us back to this debate. Since 2015, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made it so that nothing works. I am thinking, for example, of the $400 million from the green slush fund that was given to friends, rather than being used to help companies develop green technologies. That is corruption. I am also thinking about how our public safety is threatened because of the decisions made by various jurisdictions. That is not working at all. No wonder our American neighbours are nervous. There is no shortage of examples. This is not necessarily coming from President Trump. It is coming from his administration, from people who work on border security and national defence. These people are meeting with us and asking us what is happening in Canada because things are no longer working. They are very nervous. They are worried about what is happening here and what could come their way.</ParaText>

I did an interview about this today actually, because in my region, Quebec City, there has been a lot of talk lately about what is happening in prisons, about how the situation is out of control, about how incarcerated criminals are no longer monitored as they used to be because of the legislation stemming from Bill C‑83, which came into force in 2019.

A person can be arrested four or five times in one day and released every time. Criminals all across Canada and Quebec are rolling on the ground laughing, especially in the Montreal area.

In the end, now it is clear that it was pointless. They are still supporting the Liberals.

There are two things happening. On the one hand, there are external structures and external companies that are paid $20 billion a year to manage government affairs. They like to call it strategic advice. On the other hand, the civil service is being increased by 40%. There is a lack of coherence there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729445">Madam Speaker, I am rising today to speak about the green slush fund scandal, which we have been debating here for some time. Particularly, I am speaking to the subamendment, which would change the amendment by adding “except that the order for the committee to report back to the House within 30 sitting days shall be discharged if the Speaker has sooner laid upon the table a notice from the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel confirming that all government institutions have fully complied with the order adopted on June 10, 2024, by depositing all of their responsive records in an unredacted form”. I stress “unredacted”, because we have to stop this cover-up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729446">This order was originally given by the Speaker back on June 10, and here we are discussing the question of privilege on the green slush fund that the Liberals had set up to allow Liberal insiders to enrich themselves and to spend almost $400 million from taxpayers on themselves and on other Liberal friends, and they violated rules that were identified by the Auditor General. There was $58 million that the Liberal-appointed board on the green slush fund shovelled out on projects that could not demonstrate any environmental development benefit or green technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729447">As a former chair of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, I know that the Sustainable Development Technology Canada organization had been, up until the Liberals under the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> and going back to Navdeep Bains when he was industry minister, functioning perfectly in helping small green-tech funds get angel investments and direct government support to bring new products into the market to reduce our carbon footprint and to ensure that we were having clean land, clean air and clean water. However, trust this Liberal government with its history of always enriching Liberal insiders and friends, and the corruption, which goes back to when I first got elected, when we were still dealing with the ad scam, then the SNC-Lavalin scandal and the WE Foundation, which all look pretty minuscule compared to this $400 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729448">There was $58 million given to projects that did not even qualify under the rules of SDTC, and another $334 million. Over 186 times, projects were awarded to board members themselves, who were in a conflict of interest. They were sitting on the board, appointed by the then Liberal minister of industry, Navdeep Bains, who originally appointed most of these people, and they were failing to observe the rules laid out. When the Auditor General looked at how dollars were being spent by SDTC, she found that 186 times these Liberal insiders, these board members, failed to recuse themselves when they were giving money to themselves, to each other and to others who were connected to the board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729449"> Finally, there was another $58 million that was handed out without even putting in place proper contribution agreements, which were meant to ensure that dollars were being spent properly. There was no follow-up, no follow-through; it was money taken and stuffed in their pockets. Luckily, the Auditor General found out because of some brave whistle-blowers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729450">We have been talking about how the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> was blamed by the Auditor General for failing to do sufficient monitoring of SDTC and failing to look at all the alerts and red flags that were going up. He decided to turn a blind eye. We know that Cycle Capital, one of the companies that received dollars, went to the direct benefit of the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, who had shares in Cycle Capital, and we have seen those shares now increase exponentially because of the supposed benefit of these government dollars, these hard-earned dollars from taxpayers, that funded SDTC, which they then turned into a green slush fund to allow them to continue to benefit.</ParaText>

As the subamendment says, the order to report back to the House is not required if the government hands over the documents. That way, first, we can fulfill our fiduciary duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used legally in this case, never mind wisely. Second, the RCMP can take these documents and start an in-depth investigation of the scandal at hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729461">Over the years, we have witnessed Liberals continually violating the basis of our democratic institutions and abusing taxpayer dollars. All we need to look at is how they misspent money during the pandemic and how dollars were handed out during the arrive scam. It turns out that we had to call one of the creators of the arrive scam app to the bar because he refused to testify. We know that hundreds of millions of dollars were never accounted for. We were told that the arrive scam app could have been easily produced for under half a million dollars, but instead it cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The lack of proper governance and the lack of putting in the proper checks and balances allowed the arrive scam to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729462"> That is what has happened with the green slush fund. The Liberals did not carry out their responsibility as a government to ensure taxpayers' dollars were being used for what they were meant for in the various programs and operations of the government. The Liberals allowed SDTC to take those monies to benefit themselves, benefit a minister and benefit close friends and allies of the Liberal Party.

It is the Liberals' soft-on-crime policies that have made our streets less safe. The Liberals have also hollowed out our military. We are short over 15,000 troops because of the woke policies the Prime Minister has brought forward. People are leaving in droves and we are having trouble getting enough back to replace them. Our ships are rusting out, our fighter jets are worn out, our army has been hollowed out and everybody who works in the Canadian Armed Forces is burnt out. He has failed to protect Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729466">The Prime Minister's second responsibility is to manage the relationship with the United States. We are seeing how that is going right now because of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s mass immigration and the problems that has created at our southern border, the U.S.'s northern border, with people going across the border illegally. In some cases, as reported, people who have crossed into the U.S. from Canada have been charged for wanting to commit terrorism in the United States. That is because of uncontrolled immigration, and it does not bode well with the Americans. We also have the out-of-control fentanyl crisis, which the Liberals have failed to address. As we continue to see these types of issues, how do we protect Canada when we are not properly managing our relationship with the United States? </ParaText>

Instead of protecting Canada, the Liberals have decided to hollow out our military and disrespect the police officers across this country.

I am wondering whether he can reflect on the fact that the only time in modern history when our military spending dropped below 1% of our GDP was while he was the parliamentary secretary to the minister of defence. It is very rich for him to come in here and say that we have to spend more on our military, when he was directly responsible for allowing spending to get below 1%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729477">However, let us not talk about the past; I am willing to focus on the future. The current government has shown how we are going to get to approximately 1.8% and how we will go beyond that to achieve our NATO target of 2%. While the member and I were on the defence committee together, we both agreed it should be at 2%. Can he stand up today and say that if elected to form government, the Conservatives will actually commit to increasing to 2% of GDP, yes or no?</ParaText>

The House of Commons is the voice of Canadians, and the government cannot ignore this request. It is not just a request; this is an order of the House. This is exactly what the Liberal government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729514"> Our motion could not have been clearer. It demanded that all documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, now widely known as the Liberal billion-dollar green slush fund, be tabled with the law clerk of the House of Commons and transferred to the RCMP for investigation. The government had 30 days to comply, but it did not do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729515"> As a result, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege with the Speaker. The Speaker agreed that the members' privileges of the House had been breached and that the government had ignored an order of the House. However, the Liberal government continues to ignore it. I know Liberal colleagues across the aisle will say they have tabled 29,000 pages of documents. What they do not say is that many of those documents were heavily redacted, against the instructions of this Parliament. It does not matter whether they table two pages or two million pages; if the documents are redacted and blacked out, we cannot see the information on those pages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729516">If the Liberals chose to hide the relevant information that the House requested to protect Liberal insiders, then those documents are not worth the paper or the ink that was used. Ultimately, the Liberal government is hiding the information from the RCMP. We have to question why this has gone on for weeks and weeks. What are the Liberals trying to hide?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729517"> Just to go back and give a little history for anyone listening who is not familiar with this ethical scandal at Sustainable Development Technology Canada, before the current Liberal government, this program was not controversial. Through past governments of other parties and all parties, SDTC provided funding to Canadian innovators seeking to develop clean new technologies. However, under the current Liberal government, SDTC became widely known as the green slush fund because it was known as a hotbed of corruption for use by Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729518"> We know this because the Auditor General of Canada, the Ethics Commissioner and whistle-blowers uncovered clear and widespread corruption in favour of Liberal insiders. The issues began in 2018 when the Liberal industry minister at the time, Navdeep Bains, chose to appoint a new chair to the SDTC, an entrepreneur who was already receiving funding through one of her companies. The Liberals were warned internally of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729519">We had heard this and this has come to light. The Liberals were told that up to that point, the fund had never had a chair with interests in companies receiving funding, yet they chose to appoint her anyway. The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated or managed by board members, as described by the Auditor General. Board members went on, through SDTC, to grant funding to companies that they held stock or positions in. It was a direct conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729520"> Bains, the Liberal minister at the time, went on to appoint two other controversial board members who engaged in unethical behaviour, in obvious conflicts of interest, acting by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes. Department officials from the government sat in on board meetings. They were witness to 186 conflicts of interest at the board, but they did not intervene.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729521">Then, in November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices at SDTC. In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, forcing the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> to suspend SDTC funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729522"> In November 2023, the Auditor General started to conduct an audit. This audit found many approved projects that were ineligible for funding, a conflict of interest or both. There was $58 million that went to 10 ineligible projects that, on all occasions, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology, the actual purpose of the fund. The Liberal-appointed SDTC board approved $334 million, over 186 cases, for projects in which the board members held a conflict of interest. These numbers are absolutely staggering. The Auditor General found that the Liberal minister “did not sufficiently monitor” the contracts that were given to the Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729523">This is a culture of corruption that was Liberal-made. We know this because the Auditor General gave SDTC a clean bill of health back in 2017. It was only after the hand-picked Liberal board members were appointed that this fund began voting itself really absurd amounts of taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729524"> The Liberals will say this agency was at arm's length, but there were government officials sitting in on board meetings, so it was not at arm's length. The Liberal minister recommended board appointments, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada had senior department officials sitting in on every board meeting, monitoring the activities of the board. It is unbelievable that senior department officials said nothing during this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729525"> As well, we know the Auditor General did not analyze all of the projects and contracts. In fact, it was only approximately half that the Auditor General analyzed. Therefore, these 186 instances could potentially be considerably higher, maybe even double that. This is shocking. It is why this Parliament has been seized with this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729526">It really bodes the question: Why are the Liberals fighting so hard to not bring the documents forth and to not shine a light on what has occurred? If there were all of these conflicts of interest, why would they not want to shine sunlight on the situation and bring all of this to light so it can be analyzed, and if there is criminal activity, that could potentially be pursued? It is unbelievable that this is all being pushed under the rug because the government does not want it to come to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729527">It is disappointing we are here discussing this matter of privilege rather than discussing issues that are important to residents in my community of Kelowna—Lake Country and, in fact, all Canadians. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, there is really no shortage of issues to be discussing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729528">One issue I would like to talk about, and hear more on, is crime and how members of my community are worried over the rise in violent crime that has happened under the watch of the NDP-Liberals. The statistics are shocking compared to 2015. Homicides are up 28%, sexual assaults are up 75%, gang murders have nearly doubled, auto thefts are up 46% and extortion is up 357%. These are serious, violent crimes. British Columbia has seen the total number of violent Criminal Code violations increase by over 50% since 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729529">The situation of crime really is out of control. Instead of debating how to better keep our communities safe, we are debating this matter of privilege regarding this apparent Liberal cover-up. The legislative changes made by the Liberal government, supported by the NDP, serve to put the welfare of perpetrators, often violent ones, over the welfare of victims.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729530">Law enforcement and policy experts are calling for reform. Liberal Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> directed judges to act with restraint when imposing bail conditions, even with violent repeat offenders. It has been a driving force behind the catch-and-release nature of Canada's bail system. Liberal Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> removed mandatory minimum sentences for 14 Criminal Code sections, including serious crimes related to firearms and drugs. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729531">Liberal Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document> changed the correctional system in part to ensure those convicted and sentenced to penitentiaries are provided with the least restrictive environment for that person. Many believe it is this legislation that allowed serial killers like Paul Bernardo to move to a medium-security prison environment despite committing heinous crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729532">Across Canada, law enforcement experts and associations have made it clear they are fed up with the Liberal government's legislative agenda that increased crime and chaos in many of our neighbourhoods. For example, recently, the Police Association of Ontario, the Ontario Provincial Police Association and the Toronto Police Association issued a joint statement following an intense shootout in Toronto that led to 23 arrests and 16 firearms being seized. It states, “Our members are increasingly frustrated and angered as they continue risking their lives to apprehend repeat violent offenders.” It went on to say the incident “should serve as a call to action for the federal government to fix our bail system so repeat and violent offenders can’t continue to harm our communities while out on bail.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729533">The Vancouver Police Union, close to where I am in British Columbia, stated how Liberal justice reforms are “doing little to address actual crime and violence.” It also said the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is “not aware of the ongoing gang war here in B.C. which is putting both our members and public at risk on a daily basis.” The Surrey Police Union, also in British Columbia, described its pressing current issue as “the surge of illegal firearms coming across our borders and ending up in the hands of violent criminals”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729534">Conservatives will stop the crime by first scrapping Liberal Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document>. Conservatives have also put forth many common-sense bills to address public safety. My own private member's bill, the end the revolving door act, Bill <Document DbId="11540753" Type="4">C-283</Document>, would have expanded justice system sentencing to people suffering from addiction through treatment and recovery in federal penitentiaries. Unfortunately, this was voted down by most NDP and Liberal MPs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729535">Again, instead of discussing these common-sense solutions to stop the crime in our communities, we are discussing this matter of privilege. Many of our Conservative colleagues, too many to mention in the time I have here today, have also put forth really great private members' bills that would address the issue of crime, everything from looking at crime that is happening in hospitals to extortion, car thefts and many more. I could do a whole speech just on that. We are putting forth common-sense solutions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729536"> There is another issue that I would like to be discussing more, instead of a matter of privilege. Although that is important, we are only discussing it because the Liberals are holding us in this place, because the Liberals are not abiding by the will of the House. Another issue that I would like to be discussing is fixing the budget and restoring affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729537">Inflationary spending and the lack of good economic policies have seen the Canadian economy deteriorate, and Canadians are worse off because of it. We know why. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said that he does not think about monetary policy and that budgets balance themselves. His latest comment was, “I'll let the bankers worry about the economy.” How completely out of touch is this with what the role of government is and what his role is? The Parliamentary Budget Officer has reported that “rising inflation and tighter monetary policy have eroded purchasing power, particularly among lower-income households.” Most Canadians spend the bulk of their income on basic necessities like food, shelter and transportation. When their purchasing power suffers, it makes just getting by that much harder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729538">This reality has been realized when it comes to food bank use in Canada. The cost of food has increased by over 22% since 2020 alone, forcing many to go to a food bank. The committee that I am on, the human resources committee, has had a lot of testimony on this from food banks and from not-for-profits, who have talked about the fact that they had volunteers before who have now become clients, that seniors who would maybe volunteer now have to go back to work, that people are not volunteering because they literally cannot afford the transportation to come and volunteer, that donations are down. This is what is happening in Canada. This is the Canada that we are in right now, and this is after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government. We know, for example, that over two million Canadians have visited a food bank in one month alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729539"> Something that is especially upsetting is the rise of child poverty. According to the 2024 report card on child and family poverty in Canada, 1.4 million children live in poverty in Canada now. We need to discuss how economic policies and inflationary spending have really gotten us to this point. Instead, we are discussing this matter of privilege. There are really serious and broad economic concerns that are happening in Canada. It just really illustrates the results of the disastrous Liberal government and how it has affected people's lives and Canadians' prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729540">I will say as well that the Liberals have not given a fiscal update so that we would know where the debt is this year. They continue to have spending. We have no idea what the status of our debt is. Canada's federal debt will rise to $1.2 trillion this year. That is based on previous numbers. The interest we will pay in servicing the debt will increase to $54 billion. Again, this is based on previous numbers. Just to put that into perspective, that is more than the revenue that has been raised in the past from GST. It is unbelievable how much we will be spending on servicing our debt and how much our children and grandchildren will be spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729541">As well, Canada's GDP per capita continues to decline, meaning that there is less money to go around for more people. This is really troubling, given that while Canada's GDP per capita fell by 3% in the last four years, the GDP per capita of the United States increased by 7% in that same time period. It is total economic mismanagement on the account of the NDP-Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729542">The government is continuing to not comply with the will of Parliament and refusing to bring forth the documents that are the will of Parliament. There are a lot of important issues that we need to be discussing here. I will just end with the carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729543">We have all of these tax increases that will be coming down the line early next year. We have the carbon tax, which will be increasing on April 1. We have the excise tax, which will be increasing on April 1. Especially with the carbon tax, this just makes the price of everything go up, everything that is grown, produced and transported, yet the government is bent on increasing these taxes. It is putting us really at an economic disadvantage. We are hearing testimony at a lot of committees about how tax increases are forcing people to leave Canada and forcing businesses to leave. These are the things we need to be talking about.</ParaText>

It is really a nonsensical question coming from that member, considering that he is the one who continually talks in this House on this topic and, frankly, almost any other topic. He is the king of filibustering and he is the Liberals' spokesperson most of the time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729574">It is another day, another scandal. It really feels like everything is on fire. It really is heavy right now for a lot of people in Canada. When they watch this House, it is so frustrating for people at home. I assure them it is also frustrating to sit in here and listen to the repeat, the <I>Groundhog Day</I> that it is in here, every day with the same thing over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729575">Canadians really want one thing. They want an election. It is the only way out of this disaster. This is a disaster. This would be the most consequential election in my lifetime and in many people's lifetimes because, without a doubt, people's lives depend on it. That is not dramatic. That is not being a rage farmer. That is the fact of what is happening on the streets of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729576">I do not know how the Liberals and New Democrats go home after a week here and go to a grocery store or go out in their community and not hear this from every member in their community. There is no trust. There is nothing in place anymore and all hope feels lost and that is a terrible feeling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729577">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> calls it a vibe; it is a bad vibe. It is a bad vibe, according to the finance minister, that over two million people are accessing a food bank in a month. It is a bad vibe that one in five kids are experiencing poverty. It is a bad vibe that the number of kids in homeless shelters has tripled in Toronto in the last eight years. It is a bad vibe when we walk down ByWard Market on a Tuesday at seven o'clock and a man has overdosed, dead on the street, and paramedics roll up to revive him, which they tell me they have already done multiple times that week. It is a bad vibe. That is who is in charge of our country right now, so we can bet people are mad. We can bet people are hurt and hopeless. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is vibing to Taylor Swift, exchanging friendship bracelets while the city of Montreal burns. It is a bad vibe. This all comes down to a level of corruption that has to be addressed in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729578">The green slush fund is a fund created by the Liberals that the Auditor General has done an audit on and we are still waiting, pushing and pressuring the Liberals to hand over the unredacted documents from the green slush fund. A whistle-blower came to committee and said they could not take this anymore; could not lay their head on the pillow knowing what is going on in the government and keep showing up to work, because they wanted a moral compass. Therefore, the whistle-blower came and testified at committee and said that this is corruption at its core; this is a billion-dollar fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729579">The Auditor General proceeded to do an audit. There were 90 decisions in which the fund had violated its own conflict of interest policies. One out of six projects funded by SDTC, which was $59 million, were not eligible and in some cases did not even support the development of a new green technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729580"> It is scam and corruption. Over a dozen government departments and agencies either provided redacted documents or simply refused to comply with the order and withheld some or all of their records. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729581">Right now in the House as I am speaking, there is talk everywhere. Nobody is even listening anymore because corruption is normal under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is nothing to the Liberals. They are talking and it does not matter because the Conservatives keep speaking and saying the same thing. We will keep saying the same thing because we will fight for Canadians. We are the only ones in this House calling out this corruption. It is absurd and insane, and everyone at home knows this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729582">This is the most consequential time in the history of politics. One in five kids are hungry and there are 1,400 homeless encampments. The YWCA shelter in Halifax says women cannot leave the shelters because there is no housing. What happens when women cannot leave a shelter or get into a shelter? Intimate partner violence on the street goes up. Women are dying. A woman was murdered in broad daylight just weeks ago in Ottawa while she was with her two children. The man got out of the car, slit her throat and she bled out. Do I have the Liberals' and NDP's attention now? I hope I do, because this is so consequential. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729583">We may be sitting in here in our green comfy chairs, but people at home are starving. These are not made-up statistics. This is real life. If we talk to people and maybe visit some of the homeless encampments, we will know what is happening. Food banks are running out of food. The people who used to volunteer at a food bank are now using a food bank. The 2024 hunger report from Food Banks Canada show the shocking statistics of over two million users in one month, 30% of whom are children, but those numbers are low. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729584">I thought about Fleming College that runs a food bank. It would not be registered with Food Banks Canada. I thought about Street Level Advocacy, where Scott Couper gives hot meals to people every single day. He is not registered with Food Banks Canada. Ladies make sandwiches and drive downtown to deliver them. They are not taken into account for that. Those numbers are not even real. They are higher than that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729585">There is not one area in this country that is functioning. Not one area is doing okay or thriving. It is so sickening to sit on this side of the House and hear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, with the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> holding him in power, say it is not the Liberals' fault. No, they are a victim. The <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> had the audacity to stand in this House yesterday, when he was called out on his atrocious justice laws in this country, and say they delivered bail reform. Yes, they delivered bail reform all right. How about they check the incidence of femicides in this country, of women being murdered in broad daylight, or the 16-year-old girl in northern Ontario who had her arm slashed off by her abusive boyfriend, who, guess what everyone, was out on bail? However, the justice minister delivered bail reform. When we destroy trust, we destroy society. The Prime Minister has no respect, he has no trust and there is chaos on the streets. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729586">People need hope. People need to know that there will be laws put in place to prevent this level of corruption that we have never seen in history. It has become normal. It is so common, it is normal. We have a former minister of employment who misinformed the House of his indigenous heritage, and who took money from the government, much like this green slush fund. He is gone. He is no longer the minister. It is just, let us move on to the next thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729587"> How many ministers are gone from that side of the House? There is the former minister of public safety who said it was not his fault that Paul Bernardo got transferred to medium security in the dead of night and the families of victims were not notified. He said it was not his fault. It is never their fault. They say that they did not get the email, or they did not read the documents. They drop like flies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729588"> I feel so bad for the MPs over there who actually care about their constituents, because I know there are some. I see their body language in here when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stands up, and they are sick, just like the rest of us, because he gaslights Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729589">That is the hope I want to tell people at home they need to have, because it is here. The change is coming. Two, three years ago, even when I first got elected, people were still afraid to speak the truth, because they would get cancelled. They were called a racist or a misogynist. If they did not have vaccine status, they were called a leper, divided and shamed and put down. They would be cancelled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729590"> No more. People started to say, “I am not any of those things. I am a good person who wants to just let people live their life without hurting others.” That is all people want in this country, and now they are standing up and they are fighting back against the insane government, the wacko government that has legalized drugs and become a drug dealer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729591">All people have to do is go outside, two blocks from here, and just walk down the street. People who used to come to Ottawa would know ByWard Market was like the most amazing place. Tell me a tiny town in this country that feels safe anymore. There are not too many. We have headlines of stabbings and shootings on a regular basis in a community like Peterborough, where a man who murdered an indigenous woman might get four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729592"> People are so stressed. I want to read you some stats, because I think the stats tell the human consequences of bad policy and bad leadership. It is really important to know these numbers, because on the other end of these numbers are real people, real humans and real families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729593"> Children have the highest rate of food insecurity among all age groups in Canada, 24% in 2022. That is 1.8 million children. One third of kids in Canada do not enjoy a safe and healthy childhood. In what country, like Canada, do we not take care of our kids where they feel safe? Two-thirds of Canadians report experiencing abuse before the age of 15. Nearly one in five kids live in poverty. Suicide is a leading cause of death for children aged 10 to 14 in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729594"> Over the past decade, Canada has fallen sharply from 10th to 30th place amongst OECD countries for the well-being of children. Twenty per cent of children and youth in Canada, approximately 1.2 million young people, are affected by a mental health disorder. If they have the courage to ask for help, there is none on the other side of that. Also in this country, under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, health care has been decimated. There are doctors ready to practice in this country, but they cannot.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729595">We are spending more on servicing the debt in this country than we are on transfers to health care. The economy is the foundation of this whole problem, and that is why we are in this discussion right now. The government forgot, or maybe it knew the whole time, that it does not have any money. It has taxpayer money. It has Canadians' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729596">The Liberals take that money; they do not have any accountability, and they waste it. They give it to their friends and their family, or they try to buy votes with a $250 cheque that only some people get. No, they cannot give it to the people with disabilities or the people who really need it.</ParaText>

What does the carbon tax do? It puts a tax on every single thing Canadians use and drives up the cost of living even more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729601">I want to come back to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s saying that Canadians are just not in the right vibe. They are just not in the right vibe when they go to the food bank or when one in five kids is living in poverty. It is just not a good vibe. There is nothing serious about the government.

              <ParaText id="8729602"> I watched <I>Gladiator</I> with my parents and my kids on Friday night.

I thank him for seconding this motion; we are very glad the Speaker recognized the issue as an emergency for Canada. The motion relates specifically to the incoming president of the United States, who has threatened a 25% tariff on Canadian workers and businesses. That would create significant economic chaos when it comes to our capabilities to provide well-paying jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729623">I will start by noting that this type of bullying tactic has been used in the past before. At different times, Canada has had to respond appropriately to these measures. With regard to this particular tariff that is noted, it also puts us in the same position as Mexico; the Mexican government has indicated that it would respond even more forcefully than what we have seen from our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and some of our premiers right now. Specifically, the Mexican government has talked going line by line back against the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729624"> Here we are, having to compete as a North American region against the world. We have one partner with which we have engaged in a free trade agreement, both traditionally and continually, with our latest agreement still being on the paperwork and being worked on right now. This will undermine not only our domestic jobs and workers but also those in the U.S. and Mexico, because we all work toward trading and prospering together. It will further undermine our capabilities to compete with other parts of the world, where we have seen some of these practices cost jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729625">Right now, Canadians are feeling the pinch. They are certainly feeling very stressed as we go into this winter. Paycheques are getting smaller, when it comes to the inflation that has taken place. There is uncertainty with regard to pensions and benefits with the rising costs, and that is one of the reasons the New Democrats have pushed hard in the current Parliament and have been proud to get programs such as dental care and pharmacare. These are backstops that are huge and controllables that should have been done before to make us more prosperous and, more importantly, healthier and more capable of productivity in the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729626">That is one of the big differences, as we have seen successive Conservative and Liberal governments do massive corporate tax reductions that did not see the economic prosperity that we would like to see. We saw all that wealth disappear, much of it even going to the United States, where they tax on worldwide profits. We have actually done massive subsidization of our industries and other foreign industries. That has cost us significantly, whereas dental care and health care are actually reasons to invest in Canada, and they make the controllable expense go right to the individual worker. Therefore, the workers and their families get the benefit of better health, better training and, more importantly, more contribution to society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729627"> As we know, in regard to our relationship with the United States, we are actually in a trade surplus. They are one of the few nations that we actually have a trade surplus with, and that goes back to historic trade agreements that actually were negotiated. In brief, we had an auto pact. It was a significantly improved-upon situation in which we were the leaders in automotive manufacturing in the world, often placing first or second at different times. When we lost that capability, because we entered into our first free trade agreement, we saw the Liberal government not challenge a WTO challenge from Japan at that time, which broke that up. We have since disappeared back into eighth or ninth place with regard to automotive manufacturing and assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729628">That was not even a trade concern of the U.S. at that time, but it was of our other partners. We saw the Liberal government basically stand down on Canadians for that. Now, those eventual repercussions have come to the point at which we are doing significant incentives for automotive manufacturers, similar to what they are doing in the United States, Mexico and other places. We have an integrated market, which is certainly going to be affected by a 25% tariff, or even a 5% tariff if it comes to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729629">I would also like to note that we have seen the Conservatives, in the past, not do their due diligence in protecting Canadians. In particular, with the softwood lumber industry, we actually won a WTO challenge against the United States, and we were rewarded with billions of dollars in money. We then had the Stephen Harper government abandon collecting it, with the actual effect it had on our economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729630"> With regard to this particular threat from Donald J. Trump, historically, we also saw tariffs and other types of issues brought on Canadians during his first term in office, so we need to take this very seriously. I give the premiers and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> credit for at least getting together right away, and I do want to acknowledge that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729631">As New Democrats, we believe we are going to have to exercise our full strength on this, but that group meeting right now is insufficient to deal with the process and the crisis in front of us. We want to see labour unions, civil society and others included later on. There needs to be a war room and an actual strategy with measurables, which would involve more than just the leaders of the provinces and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, or a small cabal of the Liberal cabinet undertaking some of those issues the government believes are important, to deal with this. Sometimes the government has not supported the right elements to actually deal with these situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729632">When I asked for the emergency debate today, only the NDP raised the issue that Trump had specifically identified the border as not being adequately resourced, or at the very least that the U.S. was having problems coming from Canada and Mexico. There is no way we would ever want to assent to the argument that the Mexican border and the Canadian border are similar, but there has been a history, which has been going on for a number of years, with the U.S. politicizing the border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729633">On the Canadian side, we saw the Harper administration cut over 1,100 CBSA workers, which it fired. It even fired the ones who were doing some of the work that stops gun and drug smuggling, along with a number of different things. We have not replaced those officers. In fact, we are short 2,000 to 3,000 workers right now, and they would need to be trained. We have been pushing for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729634">We want to see a number of different things get done. We want to start identifying the tariffs we can actually push back on. The Harper administration actually put tariffs on Canadian companies because it did not know what it was doing. A good example is Dainty in my riding, which mills rice. It was going to get an extra tariff from the Harper administration, which would have cost it more jobs, to retaliate against the U.S. We need to start inventorying all these businesses and organizations on which there will be effects to figure out how we would do a retaliatory tariff. We need to be very sharp regarding that, and we want to prepare our challenge right now, before the president-elect takes office, because we only have a matter of months to get our situation in order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729635">The New Democrats are calling for a comprehensive approach that would not just be determined by government figureheads, but would involve union representation of the workers whose jobs would be threatened. It is very important to have an approach that is inclusive because workers will also be able to give us the best evidence on how we unravel some of the investments in the threats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729636">We also want to make sure, and this is something we have been saying for a number of years, that we stop other countries from using the environment and labour as a subsidy in our trade relationships. We finally did get this into the new agreement, but the government has not been forceful enough, and we have seen China, Mexico and other places use a practice of undercutting and depressing Canadian worker wages, making sure we do not see the successes we should when we compete in a fair way. We need to be more responsible with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729637">We need to also diversify our interprovincial trade. For goodness' sake, we are still seeing problems with that. It happens all the time. Second to that is getting into other markets because, as I noted at the beginning of my speech, Canada is pretty much at the end of almost all the trade agreements. We have deficits and not surpluses, so we need to have a better strategy there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729638">As I conclude, I want to again call for the practical things we can control, that we can actually engage in, and doing a full strategy—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729649"> Madam Speaker, there have absolutely been a series of political advancements that have been used against Canadian trading elements for a long period of time, with no real significant push-back from the Canadian government. As I mentioned in my remarks, the former Conservative government cut 1,100 officers and also got rid of some of the teams that worked specifically on gun and drug smuggling, so that affected the border in two ways. On top of that, there is an order in council that would allow our border officers to help the RCMP. The government has been sitting on that since 1932 without acting on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729650">When I was in Parliament before, during another House session, we worked to get our officers armed, equivalent to those in the United States in many respects. We wanted to avoid practices that could be used against us as a weapon in saying that were weak on our border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729651">Lastly, we still have deficient marine resources in the Great Lakes. We have deficient supports, as we need 2,000 to 3,000 officers. That is the bottom line. Having those would deflect some of this unfair criticism.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729652"> Madam Speaker, as a general rule, the Conservatives are often found missing in action when it comes to dealing with the issue of trade. Let me give some examples. Today, they had to follow the NDP lead in getting an emergency debate on the issue. Getting down to the nuts and bolts of the issue of trade with the United States, the first thing the Conservatives did the last time, when things got a little bit difficult, was to capitulate. In essence, they said we should give the Americans whatever it took to get an agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729653">As a government, we have done this before with President-elect Trump. We will be able to do it again by using a team of experts, who I would suggest are the best trade negotiators in the world, from within our civil service. I wonder if my colleague could provide his thoughts about the quality of the individuals that Canada has to offer in negotiating good trade agreements for Canadians.</ParaText>

The government will collect the sums of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729655">However, I think it is important to point out that the government needs to stop itself from hurting itself further. A good example of that is the reduction of border hours. The government had an agreement with the previous administration where it closed ports of entry in Canada and moved staff outside of those areas. It did not agree to open up a training facility in Windsor to add the more than 2,000 to 3,000 workers we need on our border. It also did not expand CBSA officers' powers to deal with some of the issues of gun control and so forth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729661">New Democrats are deeply concerned and troubled by the fact that, just south of us, American conservatives are yet again attacking Canadian industry. This person, Mr. Donald Trump, is someone who Canadians know all too well. He is like a scary movie. We have seen this scary movie before. He was president once already.

              <ParaText id="8729663">Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Conservatives always bow down to him. That is the problem we are facing today. Consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments have always been at the whim of America and its demands. We need the kind of Canada that demonstrates to our workers and our industries that we care about them and value their tremendous support, so much so that we would invest in them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729664">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> made it clear that the very serious issues at the border are man-made. They were made by the Liberals and the Conservatives. The Conservatives cut over a thousand CBSA workers, which was shameful, and today they are coming to this place saying that we need to be non-partisan now, after they already messed it up and broke the system. The Liberals inherited that system and found it convenient to just keep many of those aspects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729665"> Canada, as a matter of fact, does not have an immense trade deficit with the United States. It is just not going to the right people. It is going to billionaires on Bay Street and Wall Street, and Canadians are always left behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729666">We have some of the best labour and skills across the globe. My home province of Alberta has the best labour right across this country. They are skilled labourers who are doing the hard work every single day. They know, when they are drilling in our oil and energy sector, for example, that it is a tough job. They send all of that product over to the United States, and then we import the developed product, gasoline, and pay more for it because of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729667"> For a long time, Albertans have asked me, when I knock on doors, why we cannot produce these goods right here in Canada. They ask me why we cannot produce the things that make Canada great right here at home. New Democrats are the only ones who stand by our tremendous labourers here in Canada. We know their value. We are going to support them in their jobs. We are going to make sure that Mr. Trump knows exactly who he is messing with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729668">Canada accounts for a tremendous amount of trade with the United States, so much so that it relies on us. That means Americans are going to have to start paying a lot more for the goods that we make here in Canada, things like the products that go into building homes. Can members guess what that would mean for the American family that wants to buy a home? Donald Trump is prepared to increase the cost of their home. He is ready to increase the cost of groceries and gasoline too. For every single good, Donald Trump is prepared to make Americans pay more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729669">Canada has an opportunity here. We are an immensely courageous country, but also one that belongs to a globe that needs us. We know that. Canadian goods, services, jobs and products can go elsewhere. We need to show the United States, show Donald Trump, that our industries are not only the best industries that produce the best quality, but are also desired elsewhere. They are desired in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. They are desired right across the globe. Canadian-made products are the best products in the world. We need to diversify our trade. We have trade partners that so desperately want to see a Canadian trade agreement to bring our goods and services right to their doorstep. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729671">Canada can use tariffs, but we should not be using tariffs to instigate a trade war just to race to the bottom and make everybody pay. We should institute trade policies and tariffs that are very precise, that have a very important objective and that are used as part and parcel of a larger trade policy that looks at, for example, benefits to indigenous people, to our environment and to the care economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729672">People need to know that when we use our economic might, we are using our economic strength to help regular, everyday people. That is why we have an economy. It is not to make more billionaires like Donald Trump even richer. It is not to serve Bay Street here in Canada just so it can continue to exploit labour elsewhere. No, Canadians put their hard-earned time and their blood, sweat and tears into the great products we make because they know that it is for their family and for our country, and for us to be able to share our tremendous wealth with all people who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729673">We have an ability in this country to end poverty, which is something New Democrats have always been consistent about. We know that if we use the tremendous power and wealth of our country, we can in fact eliminate child poverty. We can eliminate waiting lines at hospitals. We can build a social safety net such that no matter when someone falls down, and I say “when”, not “if”, they will get back up. That is the kind of Canada New Democrats believe in, and it starts with sound and strong trade policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729674">When a country like the United States does not want to play fair with us, does not want fair trade, then we have to have the courage and the ability to make certain we are prepared as a country to defend our industries, defend our labour and look to the very beautiful and Canadian-made solutions we can develop right here at home. We can do that, and as a matter of fact we have done it in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729675">There was a time of hyperinstability at the end of World War II, and global free trade was at its limit, barely happening. However, Canada did not resign itself to being unable to support the war effort, unable to generate revenue and unable to generate good jobs. No, we did the exact opposite; we looked to our fellow neighbours at that time and we asked ourselves what we could do for each other. We sent a million men and women overseas to fight Nazi terrorism in Europe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729676">Here at home, everybody else went to work. We organized over 100 crown corporations. We organized our labour to produce some of the best steel the world had ever seen. We used our tremendous might as an industrial country to make things that had never been made before. Canada was an innovator. Canada achieved immense respect for our tremendous support for our industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729677"> The subsequent decades, especially the 1980s, would see the Liberals and Conservatives selling off as many public goods as possible, leaving us with nothing today. They sold everything. They speak about a balanced budget, but they do not know how to balance a budget. Do members know what they know how to do? They know how to sell Canadian assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729678"> I will give a good example: oil, right in my province of Alberta, right where the former prime minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, came from, a member of the Conservative Party who often says how great and powerful Alberta's energy sector is, and I agree. We have the best skilled labour and the best workers possible, but what Harper will not tell us is that he gambled our future in 2008. He sold Nexen to CNOOC, a Chinese-controlled corporation, in order to balance the budget.

              <ParaText id="8729680">Madam Speaker, I believe that diversification of trade is critically important to all Canadians, which is one of the reasons we were very anxious, along with Ukraine, to actually have a Canada-Ukraine trade agreement. It was something that was widely respected and applauded, with the exception of the Conservatives of course, both in Canada and in Ukraine, as both countries benefited.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729683">Madam Speaker, Canada's economy is one that has been organized over the last 150 years largely as a raw extract exporter. What that means is that we take raw material, like a log, a rail or oil, and we export it. We do not have any value-added mechanism for Canadian products. We need to have that here. That is the first step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729684"> We need not only to make sure our products are more competitive and more innovative across the globe but also to then work, as the member suggests, in making certain that those products have a home to go to. Ukraine needs Canadian products. The Philippines needs Canadian products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729685">The market around the globe right now is so desperate for Canadian innovation and our Canadian products that it baffles me that we would be so concerned right now with the fact that the United States is implementing a tariff.

              <ParaText id="8729721"> Mr. Speaker, it is an immense privilege to stand before you today and speak to one of the most critical relations our nation has ever known, the enduring and dynamic partnership between Canada and the United States of America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729722"> Today, as we gather here in this great country, we are not just reflecting on the past. We are setting our sights firmly on a future where the Canada-U.S. relationship not only endures but thrives, and where it grows stronger, more prosperous and more resilient than ever before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729723">Let me start by stating this clearly: The Canada-U.S. relationship is one of the most important, powerful and mutually beneficial partnerships in the world, and it is a partnership that remains our top priority in the years ahead. We share a border that spans close to 9,000 kilometres, stretching across cities, towns and regions where people live, work and dream on both sides of that line and across the nation. Every single day, 3.3 billion dollars' worth of goods and services cross our border, enriching both of our countries, supporting millions of jobs and ensuring our economies remain strong, competitive and interconnected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729724"> Let us be clear about one thing: Canada is not just a neighbour to the United States; we are closely linked through friendship, geography and economic ties. Over 30 U.S. states count Canada as their top trading partner. We are the number one export destination for American goods. When the United States looks to grow, to innovate and to advance, they look north to Canada and we should take immense pride in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729725"> We are not just about trade. We are about the strength of shared values, of common interest and of a deep and enduring commitment to each other's prosperity, security and well-being. We share the same values of democracy, human rights, freedom and the rule of law. We stand side by side as allies, friends and partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729726"> Let us take a moment to talk about the undeniable power of our economic relationship. In 2022, the total trade between our two nations surpassed a staggering $1.3 trillion. Yes, that is right: $1.3 trillion. This is a trade partnership that drives our economies, creates jobs, fosters innovation and provides opportunities for millions of families on both sides of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729727"> I know some may say, “Sure, that trade is impressive, but what about the challenges? What about the risks?” To that I say challenges and risks exist in any relationship, but the true test of a partnership lies not in avoiding these challenges but in how we face them together. There is no stronger partnership on the planet than the one between Canada and the United States. We face challenges, but together we tackle them, together we find solutions and together we weather the storm, secure our borders, promote sustainable growth and create the conditions for the next generations to thrive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729728">That is why we have committed ourselves to working even harder to deepen this relationship through many initiatives like the team Canada-U.S. engagement strategy. Cabinet colleagues, MPs and officials have travelled across the United States, engaged in over 33 states, held over 300 meetings, and engaged with hundreds of businesses and elected officials on both sides of the aisle. This has been no small effort. It has been a direct, sustained and unwavering commitment to ensuring that Canada's voice is heard loud and clear in Washington and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729729"> This effort is not simply about diplomacy; it is about action. It is about ensuring that Canada remains not just a participant but a leader in the global economy. It is about creating new opportunities for Canadians and Americans alike, whether in trade, investment or innovation. It is about making sure every sector, whether it is agriculture, technology, manufacturing or energy, continues to thrive, to grow and to create jobs for people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729730"> Now let me talk about our people for a moment. This relationship is not just about governments and corporations. It is about individuals, families, communities and businesses that rely on our shared connection every single day. One in six jobs in Canada is directly tied to exports, nearly three million jobs in total. Over six million jobs in the United States depend on the success of our shared economic and trade relationship. This is not just a statistic; it is a lifeline and a testament to the tangible, real-world impact of the partnership between our two nations.</ParaText>

We will continue to engage at every level, across every sector and in every community. Our efforts are not just reactive; they are proactive. We are anticipating the needs of our businesses, our workers and our communities, and we are preparing for the challenges ahead, whether securing our borders, advancing economic opportunities, addressing the challenges of a changing climate or ensuring the supply chains that connect our two countries remain resilient and strong.

It is about the small businesses on either side of the border we represent, the industries we work in and the communities we live in. The Canada-U.S. relationship is our relationship.

              <ParaText id="8729736"> Let me conclude with this: We are not just talking about a trade agreement. We are talking about a relationship that has stood the test of time and has grown stronger with every passing year, and this will continue to be the cornerstone of our future. It is a relationship that has weathered storms, faced adversity and come out on the other side stronger. We will continue to defend it. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure Canada and the United States remain the closest, most trusted partners in the world, because the Canada-U.S. relationship is non-negotiable. It is foundational. It is vital to the prosperity, security and well-being of both our countries, and it is worth every effort to protect, strengthen and deepen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729750">Mr. Speaker, I am rising in the House today to speak out against President-elect Trump's threat of imposing tariffs on Canada, to propose a real action plan to respond to that threat and to put Canada first.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8729751"> We have a president south of the border who has made it clear he wants to put American workers and American security first. That is his right, but he and everyone else should know that when I am prime minister, we will have a head of government who puts Canada's workers and Canada's security first. That includes maintaining the most successful trade relationship the world has ever seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729752"> This is the world's longest-ever defended border. Two billion dollars of goods go across that border every day. Just to put that into perspective, more goods go between Canada and the U.S. in a few days than between the U.S. and Japan in an entire month. The Canada-U.S. border is 5,525 miles long if we include Alaska. It has 120 border crossings that facilitate 350,000 daily crossings; that is in addition to the merchandise that goes each way. The sheer volume of this relationship requires intricate planning and precision to get these goods moving back and forth. An automobile will cross the border seven times before it is completed and sent off to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729753">By the way, the Americans should understand that we are pretty important to them too. The reality is that Canada purchases more goods from the United States than does the entire European Union, despite Canada's population being one-fifteenth that of Europe. Canada is the top export destination for 31 U.S. states. The two countries have a thoroughly interconnected manufacturing supply chain and we are completely reliant on each other for energy. Energy infrastructure between our two countries is so interconnected that we have 35 major electrical transmission lines and 70 oil and gas pipelines across the border. Canada provides 40% of U.S. crude imports, making it America's largest foreign energy supplier. This is something that President Trump should care about if he intends to keep his promise to cut gas prices in half; he is going to need our oil and our energy in order to do that. We are going to need continued access to the American economy if we are to succeed. We trade twice as much with the United States as we do with the rest of the world combined.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729754">Some people dream of simply replacing the United States with other countries. These are dreams that have been talked about since the first Trudeau, who promised that we would do business with many other countries elsewhere in the world. That never happened. In fact, the weight of the American economy has increased. The share of global GDP controlled by the United States is increasing. All of the predictions that China would overtake the United States have not come true. The gap between China and the United States is widening because China has decided to return to socialist, centralized, government-planned policies. That has slowed growth in China, while American capitalism has continued to generate wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729755">That is the reality. Even if some oppose it for ideological reasons, no economic force in the world is more powerful than American capitalism. That is the reality. However, this capitalism does not work without international trade, especially with allied countries like Canada, and Canada is the United States' best ally in the world. That is why we need to protect this relationship. We need a plan for our economy and our security.</ParaText>

We have a weakened economy, a weakened military and, most of all, a weakened <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That weakness may have been one of the reasons President Trump believed that he could make these threats and trample all over the Prime Minister again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729757">The sad reality is our GDP per capita is smaller than it was 10 years ago, even while the American economy per capita has grown by 18%. Our per capita GDP fell more than any other G7 country since the year before COVID. We are one of the only countries that has not recovered its economy since before COVID happened. In reality, our housing costs, our national debt and food bank use have all doubled in the last four years, all of this before the threat of these tariffs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729758">Before the threat of these tariffs, food prices had increased 37% faster in Canada than in the United States of America. Before the threat of these tariffs, our national debt had grown by over 100% in a decade. Before the threat of these tariffs, half a trillion dollars U.S. more in Canadian investment went south than came back. That is Canadian investment dollars building American mines, factories and pipelines paying American, not Canadian, wages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729759">On top of that, the threats that we heard last night should have come as no surprise, yet, for some reason, they did surprise the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="8729763">Let us think about the impact that a 61¢-a-litre carbon tax would have when the tax is zero south of the border. President Trump has made it clear that he wants our jobs and businesses. We can only imagine his economic development teams calling trucking companies, factories and forestry enterprises telling them they are facing a 61¢-a-litre carbon tax north of the border, but that if they drive 50 kilometres south, there is no carbon tax. By the way, business and personal taxes are already much lower in the U.S. and will drop further. There will be a powerful sucking sound of jobs, businesses and money leaving our country to enrich the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729764">This is like a tariff imposed by our own government on our own economy. Compounded with a rail tariff from the United States of America, this would cripple our economy.

Let us give our people a fighting chance to save their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729765">Second, Canadian energy is not the enemy. Our energy sector is our number one net export, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made it explicit that he wants to phase out that sector. He has blocked two pipelines. He blocked the Teck Frontier mine and has prevented us from building even a single, solitary LNG liquefaction plant, which by the way would have allowed us to ship our natural gas to countries other than the United States. Right now, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has blocked LNG liquefaction on both coasts, we are stuck giving every single cubic foot of LNG we export to the Americans, on their terms, so they can liquefy it, upgrade it and turn it into a profit, something to which presumably the 25% tariff would apply. </ParaText>

Furthermore, what we spent less money on was back-office bureaucracy and consultants. This member is busy bragging that he voted for a more expensive CBSA. Yes; it went to consultants. The money did not go to boots on the ground. Tens of millions of dollars went to back-office bureaucrats and high-priced consultants, which increased the burden on taxpayers without increasing the security at the border.

              <ParaText id="8729832">I was somewhat blown away by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation>'s intervention. This evening, we are tasked with coming up with solutions and trying to comfort and reassure business people and workers. The Conservative leader did not do that at all. Later I will turn my attention to the state of the government, but what we heard this evening are the same meaningless slogans. The new slogan of the day is “Canada first”. That is going to be the new mantra of the Conservative leader, who thinks that complex problems can be resolved with incantations. It is rather shocking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729833">That makes me think of a video I saw this summer. I was watching a video with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, who is mischievous and playful. There was a cowboy dressed all in white, and my colleague wondered if it was the cowboy from the Village People. Unfortunately, it was not him. It was the leader of the official opposition. He was not singing <I>Y.M.C.A.</I>, though. He was describing his Canadian dream. In his Canadian dream, there are the Rockies, which are the mountains of Utah. We cannot make this stuff up. There is a sky, which is in Venezuela. Then there is a father driving a car in North Dakota. That is the official opposition leader's Canadian dream. We see a herd of cattle in California. To top it all off, we then see what are supposed to be Canadian fighter jets, but which are actually Russian jets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729834">It is just like the speech we heard from the leader of the official opposition just now. He was talking about real plans and real measures, but he did not come here to talk about American tariffs. Rather, he came to talk about his usual bugbears, namely the tax on carbon and fossil fuels, which is probably the most important thing to him after, say, sliced bread. On top of that, he also said that he would go back on liquefied natural gas development, end the government's woke agenda and return to a warrior culture. We are supposed to be talking about tariffs, and the leader of the official opposition is telling us that he is going to return to a warrior culture. I have never been more ashamed to be a Canadian parliamentarian than when I heard that and saw his MPs yelling, as though they were thrilled and excited and on the edge of their seats. My <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> recently said the only sensible thing one could say in this Parliament: We need to leave and build our own country, right now. This is completely discouraging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729835">That being said, let us move on to something other than these empty slogans. Today, I heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talk about team Canada. The Liberals are talking about team Canada, while the Conservatives' new pitch is “Canada first”. That does not speak to me because, if I look at history, Quebec has often been used as a bargaining chip in trade agreements. The Canadian economy is based on two pillars: the energy sector, with the fossil fuel industries, and the automotive sector. Every time there have been tough negotiations with the United States, Canada has prioritized these two sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729836">Today, I am going to ask my fellow members from Quebec, whether they are members of the Conservative Party or the Liberal Party, to put everything in place and to make a reasonable effort to advance Quebec's interests. That is what I want for them. I am saying that because, when I look at the forestry industry, I have to say that it is always treated worse than any of Canada's other economic sectors. What is more, we are dealing with the threat of American tariffs, tariffs that the forestry industry is already grappling with, by the way. Even though Quebec has changed the way it calculates cubic metres of wood to bring it into line with the United States' demands, there are still tariffs. The forestry industry is experiencing a perfect storm.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="20">(2020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729837">Right now, $2 billion in tariffs is being held captive in U.S. accounts, where the forest industry cannot get at it. This is money we could be using to upgrade the forestry sector's facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729838">While I am on the topic of the forestry industry, I want to circle back to what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> said when he answered a question earlier. He said that, supposedly, we are not rising to support the forestry industry. Of course, he was referring to the conflict over the caribou order. I want to clarify a few things. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> paused his order at the request of the Bloc Québécois, which asked him to negotiate with the Government of Quebec, something he is apparently doing now. We said that it was possible to balance the need to protect caribou with the needs of the forestry industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729839">I find it rather strange that the leader of the official opposition mentioned the member for <Affiliation DbId="278521" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation> when he was talking about the forestry industry. The member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord came with us to visit a sawmill in Lac-Saint-Jean this summer. He came out and said that the forestry sector needed more support and that everyone was hoping there would be no order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729840">When we spoke with people in the industry, they told us that the tariffs were one of their biggest problems. From what they told us, they would really like the federal government to implement a liquidity program to support the forestry industry. That way, sawmills that are struggling could ask the government to advance them the money that they have paid in tariffs. They could then reimburse it when they got it back. This would enable them to invest in their equipment. Unfortunately, the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord was not prepared to do that with us. He thought it was complicated and difficult. I find it rather odd that now I am being accused of having abandoned the forestry industry, when we are trying to come up with solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729841">As I was saying, the forest industry is at a crossroads, and not just because of tariffs. It has reached a crossroads because of a serious lack of financial support from the federal government, because the pulp and paper industry is in transition, because of the infamous caribou issue, and because of the forest fires. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729842">What does the forestry industry need in order to overcome the tariff crisis? For one thing, there is the liquidity program I was talking about. The reason we need a liquidity program is that, if we want to fight tariffs, we need to make ourselves less dependent on the U.S. economy. We need to do more processing. Tariffs apply only on commodity products like two-by-fours, but there are no tariffs on processed goods. To expand our processing capabilities, we need financial support to help the forestry sector upgrade. Right now, that is impossible because tariffs are eating up too much of the forest sector's profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729843">Ottawa provides basically no financial support for the forestry industry. The Bloc Québécois commissioned a study that shows that the government provides a scant $317 million a year to support the forestry industry across Canada. What is more, 75% of that $317 million for all of Canada is in the form of loans. This is not commensurate with what is given to the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729844">For example, in Quebec, the federal government provides a mere $71 million in financial support. If we consider the fact that 75% of that amount is in the form of loans, that means that only $17 million is in the form of direct subsidies. The government is giving $17 million to one of Quebec's most important industries. It is easy to see that the federal government is providing minimal support. My region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean alone generates more in economic spinoffs for the federal government than the federal government provides in total support to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729845">We are going to have to support the forestry sector more if we want to fight effectively against the American tariffs that are coming. We need an investment strategy. Above all, we are going to need the federal government to understand that we can no longer be prisoners to commodity products, that we can no longer be prisoners to U.S. markets, and that we need to process products here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729846">When we, the members of the 2019 cohort, arrived here, we lived through the CUSMA negotiations on aluminum. I would remind members that the federal government had forgotten to protect aluminum and that aluminum was coming in through China. Once again, we were the ones who fought this battle, with the support of major unions and aluminum plants, to reach an agreement with the government that closed this loophole for aluminum entering through Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729847"> I still remember that, and I am talking about it because I see my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278521" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation> sitting there. He started that battle with us, but unfortunately had to withdraw because his party did not agree with what we were asking for. His party did not agree that we should push for aluminum to be protected under CUSMA. I just want to say that the comment made by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> earlier, to the effect that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> and I are leaving our region out in the cold, left a very bitter taste in my mouth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729848">I was talking about the aluminum industry. The federal government is offering support, but only for primary aluminum. Again, if we do not want to be prisoners to U.S. tariffs, then we need to do more processing. I do not know if my colleagues remember, but during the first round of tariffs on aluminum in 2018, $120 million was paid in retaliatory tariffs that should have gone to the aluminum sector. That $120 million was never redistributed, according to a report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729849">We made a proposal that would benefit the entire sector. Why not take that $120 million and put it in a fund for the aluminum processing sector? Why not make it a recurring fund that would allow us to process more of our grey metal here at home? Then we could reduce our dependency on the United States and create a lot more added value at home. That is the case for aluminum. There needs to be more processing. That is also the case for the forestry industry. We should be doing more processing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729850">Where we could take action, where everyone could take action if we want to protect ourselves from American tariffs, is on the much-talked-about supply management bill, Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document>. It is currently in the Senate, so it simply needs to be sent back to the House. Perhaps my Conservative colleagues could put an end to their filibustering. We could have that debate and pass a bill that would protect our supply management system from American attacks, perhaps forever. I encourage my Conservative friends to end their filibustering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729851">Finally, as for the infamous issue that Mr. Trump raised about the border, we must admit that border management is a disaster. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government even lost track of certain travelers entering the country. It also lost track of irregular migrants. Who asked questions about this, day after day? It was the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729852"> The Conservative Party is allowed 125 questions a week. I never heard them talk about border protection. I never heard them call for the closure of Roxham Road. I have never seen them do that. Today, they are acting holier-than-thou. The Conservative leader got up to make a speech about how we will have a warrior culture, not a woke culture. That is beyond belief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729853">If my Conservative colleagues had meaningful proposals to make, or even if the Liberal Party had meaningful proposals to make, what would we be talking about this evening? We would be talking about enhancing our bargaining relationship. If we want to enhance our bargaining relationship, we need to realize that 80% of everything we sell to the United States is primary materials. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729854">These primary materials essentially serve the U.S. economy. What did the government do right when the tariffs were applied to aluminum? It applied retaliatory tariffs by selecting very specific products that put pressure on U.S. senators who could then have access to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729855">There has been no talk of that so far. I have not heard anyone say one word about that. The only thing we have heard is the vitriol of the Conservative leader, who is still trying to stoke public discontent and who is not capable of behaving like a head of government. I find that disappointing from the person who could be the next prime minister.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729879">Mr. Speaker, I know that Mr. Trump is an irrational political player, but personally, I do not believe that the Americans should be imposing tariffs on aluminum, because they do not produce primary aluminum. If I remember correctly, there is only one aluminum smelter operating in the United States. We are the biggest producers of primary aluminum in North America. It is Quebec, particularly my region and the north shore, that produces all of the aluminum. It would be rather odd to add tariffs for the Americans who process it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729880">However, we have seen in the past that Mr. Trump can sometimes act irrationally. If we want to guard against that, I still think that we should increase aluminum processing here at home. To make that happen, the federal government could invest reasonable amounts. We were simply asking the government to take $120 million from the 2018 counter-tariffs and put it into a permanent fund. That is not too much to ask of the federal government, but it never agreed to do so. At the same time, however, it is prepared to put $34 billion into a pipeline. That is almost $83 billion that the government is going to invest in the pipe dream of clean oil by 2035. What a double standard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729884">Mr. Speaker, certainly the fear is that if CUSMA is renegotiated, new cracks will appear in supply management. Ideally, Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C-282</Document> will be passed quickly. Unfortunately, we are paralyzed here. The Liberal government seems to be a doormat, I have to say, for two senators who have decided to act like kings. It is rather disappointing. There is a bill on the table, our bill, and the Liberals and the NDP voted in favour of it. Even some Conservatives voted in favour of it. I do not see why we would not implement it and protect all of our farmers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729885"> Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in this House and see many of my colleagues here this evening speaking to an important topic. I will be splitting my time with the hon. member, good friend and always smiling colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278486" Type="2">Surrey—Newton</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729886">As we speak tonight about the relationship between Canada and the United States, I speak with the perspective of having worked and lived in New York City for several years. It was many years ago, but I had the real privilege and honour of working in the United States of America and being there for a number of years, at a very interesting time politically with elections and also during the events of September 11 and then returning back to Canada. We have many family members and friends all over the United States with whom we keep in contact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729887"> I would say about U.S. exceptionalism that the relationship that we have with the United States is a long-standing one. We are more than friends. We have this expression: We are fraternal, we are brothers, we are sisters. Many of us go back and forth. I was in the United States just several weeks ago taking my daughter to a soccer tournament in Akron, Ohio at the Pro Football Hall of Fame area. It was great to be there in Ohio and play against many teams from the northeast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729888"> Let us be frank here. This debate is very important because it is about our economy, the U.S. economy and the North American economy. For the last 12 months, Canada has exported $173.4 billion of energy exports to the United States; $78.3 billion in auto and auto parts exports to the United States; $63.2 billion in consumer goods; $50 billion in metal and non-metallic mineral products; and $38.8 billion in forestry. The United States needs us and we need them due to the interdependency, the supply chains, the linkages, the people-to-people ties and the fact that $3.5 billion of trade goes across that border every day unhindered and unimpeded, creating wealth and creating jobs. There are millions of jobs in the United States of America that are tied to Canada, and vice versa. The U.S. is our largest export market and we are their largest export market. Larger than China and larger than Mexico, our trading relationship has grown and continues to grow and our people-to-people relationship continues to grow. We need to emphasize that point over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729889"> Our government has dealt with the 45th president, the first Trump presidency. We will again have a mature, responsible dialogue with this incoming administration on how we can secure our borders and our energy. Three million barrels of oil is shipped every day from Canada to the United States. There are no alternatives. Our auto companies are interdependent. Parts go back and forth every day across the border in Detroit and in Windsor. This relationship is a special one and we must always act with maturity, with calm and with poise, always defending Canadian workers and always defending Canadian businesses. That is our job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729890">I would like to just digress for one minute because there is something very important I need to point out from my riding. My riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge has over 368 restaurants, employing 5,000 employees and with almost $500 million of revenue. We have put forward a plan to give Canadians a break and to help out these restaurants over the two-month period over the Christmas holidays, into the new year and past Valentine's Day. Let us do the right thing. To all my hon. colleagues, let us get this passed for the restaurants like Via Mercanti and Castello, Gelato Gelato, That's Italian, Zafferano, Spizzico and all those beautiful restaurants like Desserts Plus and L'antipasto that I visit on occasion. Their customers can go there and get a break. I have always been taught, in my values, that every little bit helps and it is imperative that we do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="45">(2045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729891">I will go back to the very important trade relationship we have with the United States and any potential tariffs they may place on either Canadian or Mexican products. I am convinced that with the unique relationship we have, forged by geography, values, common interests, strong personal connections and powerful, multi-layered economic ties, their economy only succeeds when we work together. We know that. Any potential tariffs that the Trump administration potentially places on any country will only raise inflation in the United States, prevent interest rates from falling in the United States and hurt U.S. consumers. I understand that as an economist, and I believe we all understand that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729892">As Canadian parliamentarians, our first priority is our residents and businesses, and ensuring a bright future for all Canadians. I am here to ensure that the Canadian economy succeeds. I ran, in the first place, because the economic growth rates and direction we were seeing under the Harper government were abysmal. We delivered, and we will continue to deliver on the relationship with our U.S. friends and cousins. I have cousins in New Jersey. I will give them a quick shout-out. They have been there for decades. Just to give a small fact, my great-grandfather passed through Ellis Island in 1909. We have the ship manifest when he signed in at Ellis Island. He returned to southern Italy just a few years later, but those are the kinds of ties that Canadians have to the United States. Some of my employees have family in the United States, in Washington, D.C., if I remember correctly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729893">This economic partnership between our countries supports millions of jobs through direct foreign investment and cross-border trade. These are integrated economies. Canada imports more from the U.S. than any other country by a wide margin. In fact, Canada buys over two times more goods from the U.S. than China. The United States needs us and we need them to succeed economically, to ensure the security of North America and to work together on so many mutual interests. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729894"> Canadian consumers and Canadian businesses purchase more goods from the United States than China, Japan and Germany combined. Nearly half of the goods the U.S. buys from Canada are raw materials used by American manufacturers, contributing to jobs in the U.S. and North American competitiveness. Canadian companies buy from U.S. sources to make Canadian products. In short, the U.S. trade relationship is built on long-standing binational supply chains, where roughly 70% of Canadian exports to the United States are incorporated into U.S. supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729895">There is no better example of this than the auto sector. It is a sector I covered in the private sector for many years and I chair the Liberal auto caucus here in Ottawa. Martinrea, Magna and Linamar on the auto parts supplier side, along with Toyota, Honda, Stellantis, Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen all depend on an integrated supply chain that links us with the United States. It is so important that continues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729896">In my last minute, I want to highlight a few things that I think are making a difference in the lives of the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge, which is the logistics hub for many U.S. companies. Home Depot, FedEx, UPS and Costco are all located in the city of Vaughan, in my riding. CPKC's intermodal facility is in my riding; it is the busiest intermodal facility in the country. The CN MacMillan Yard is located in Vaughan; it is the largest CN facility in the country. The area I represent is a hub. Tens of thousands of jobs in my riding and in my city are connected to trade and investment in the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729897">We must all be part of team Canada. We all must represent Canadian workers from coast to coast to coast. That is our number one job, and we will do that by working with all members of Parliament to ensure a bright future for all citizens and residents. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729900"> Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the B.C. resource sector. Actually, I worked at a pulp mill growing up in northern British Columbia, in Prince Rupert, my hometown, where I was born and raised until I moved away. The LNG facility being constructed will export LNG to Asia. Also, the western Canadian sedimentary basin in northeast B.C. obviously exports a ton of natural gas to the United States. I would say that the proud resource sector of British Columbia has existed for decades. I remember the MacMillan Bloedel days, as my hon. colleagues would know, and it is something we should be proud of and support. Again, it goes back to my theme that the U.S. economy, the U.S. citizens, our friends and neighbours down in the south need us as much as we need them. We will have responsible leadership, like we did in the first Trump administration, to make sure we get a good deal with the United States that represents the interests of our workers and their workers. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729913"> I rise today to address a critical issue that may have a significant impact on our economy, our workers and our relationship with our largest trading partner. On the heels of President-elect Trump's announcement that the United States will potentially impose a 25% tariff on Canadian imports, it is essential that we as elected representatives respond with clarity and a commitment to protect the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729914">Canada and the United States share one of the most successful and interdependent trading relationships in the world. Our economies are deeply connected, with billions of dollars in trade crossing our borders annually, supporting millions of jobs in both our countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729915">We are not just trade partners; we are also neighbours and allies. From the steel used in American manufacturing to the agricultural products that sustain both of our populations, Canada has been a reliable supplier and a trusted partner. Any disruption to this relationship jeopardizes the prosperity of both nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729916">The announcement of a 25% tariff has the potential to shift our entire economic landscape, which will have massive consequences for Canadian businesses, workers and their families. Our industries, particularly in manufacturing, agriculture and energy, will face higher costs, reduced competitiveness and the potential loss of vital export markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729917">When we consider the automobile sector, in which the United States imports over 80% of the vehicles manufactured in Canada, a 25% tariff would increase costs for automakers and consumers alike, strain supply chains and put thousands of Canadian jobs at risk. Similarly, agriculture producers will struggle to compete in a U.S. market, potentially leading to reduced income and financial instability for farming communities throughout our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729918">The effects will extend beyond individual sectors. Small businesses reliant on trade with the U.S. will face uncertainty and potential closure. Consumers will bear the burden of rising prices for goods. The economic ties that have long been the foundation of our relationship with the United States will be tested in exceptional ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729919">Canada has navigated past challenges in its trading relationship with the United States. The negotiations of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement is a testament to our ability to stand firm and secure outcomes that protect Canadian interests. During those negotiations, we faced pressure from the U.S. administration, including threats of steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel and aluminum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729920">However, Canada did not falter. Under the leadership of a skilled and determined negotiating team, we advanced our priorities and also safeguarded our key industries. We achieved crucial wins, including maintaining dispute resolution mechanisms, preserving cultural exemptions and securing access to critical markets for our farmers and manufacturers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729921">The CUSMA negotiations demonstrated Canada's strength and resilience and our commitment to protecting the livelihood of our workers while ensuring fairness in trade. We proved that, even in the face of a challenging partner, we could achieve outcomes that benefit both nations. Those experiences will provide valuable lessons as we confront this latest challenge.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="00">(2100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729922">We must also address the principle at the heart of the issue: fair and mutual trade. Canada has always advocated for a trade system based on mutual benefit, fairness and the rule of law. One-sided tariffs undermine these principles, creating a landscape of uncertainty rather than co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729923">President-elect Trump's decision appears to be driven by a protectionist agenda, yet it fails to consider the implications for economic stability across North America. Protectionism can often lead to retaliation and trade wars, which leaves all parties worse off. It is important that Canada stand firm in opposing this approach by remaining committed to constructive dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729924">In the face of this challenge, we must prioritize the protection of Canadian industries and workers. This means providing targeted support to sectors most affected by the tariffs, whether through financial assistance, tax relief or measures to diversify export markets. Our goal should be to ensure that no Canadian loses their job because of another country's trade policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729925">Canada must work with international partners to uphold the rules-based global trading system. The World Trade Organization provides mechanisms for addressing trade issues, and Canada must use every tool possible to challenge the legality of the tariffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729926">We must also engage in strategic and measured diplomacy with the United States. It is crucial to convey the message that the tariffs harm both nations and undermine decades of economic partnership. Canada must be clear that while we are open to negotiations, we will not be bullied into agreements that compromise our economic sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729927">Finally, this is an opportunity to invest in our economic resilience. By enhancing trade relationships with other global partners and fostering innovation at home, Canada can reduce its reliance on the U.S. market and ensure long-term economic stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729928">As parliamentarians, it is our duty to rise above partisanship and present a united front in the face of this challenge. We must take a team Canada approach. The stakes are too high for division. Our response must reflect the strength and determination of Canadians. This is not about tariffs; it is about defending our values, our economy and our future. It is about showing the world that Canada will not stand down when faced with difficulties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729929">I call on Parliament to stand with Canadian workers and businesses to defend our trade interests and to reaffirm our commitment to a fair and prosperous global economy. Let us take this challenge as an opportunity to strengthen our nation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729930">Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to listen to the member talk about the challenge we have with the potential of 25% tariffs being imposed on Canada, because it is kind of like Groundhog Day. The member might not know this, but in 2018, the United States slapped section 232 tariffs on Canada: 25% for steel and 10% for aluminum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729931">Some people may be wondering why I would bring this up. What does it have to do with 25% tariffs today? The real problem then was the border. Just as President-elect Trump has said, the problem now is the border. In 2018, Chinese steel was coming into Canada, going down into the United States and taking out American steel. It became such a problem that the then president of the United States imposed a 25% tariff. We are now going to have it on everything because of the complete mismanagement of the border yet again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729940"> Mr. Speaker, obviously, Canada and the United States have a long, mutually beneficial and important relationship, but it is very important to note that President-elect Trump has the right to make economic policy in the United States; he does not have the right to make economic policy in Canada. If he is going to pursue unfair policies like slapping a 25% tariff on probably his closest and most loyal ally and friend, Canada needs to respond accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729941">All members will recall that during COVID, this country could not produce a domestic vaccine and had to rely on imports from China to supply health care workers with masks and gowns. We have become dangerously reliant on other countries, and this tariff situation provides an opportunity for Canada to become more self-reliant. Canada should offer incentives to Canadian businesses that create and repatriate jobs here, just as the Americans are doing in the United States, so we can build a strong, resilient Canadian economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729947">Mr. Speaker, I am going to split my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729948">I will start by saying that the threats by U.S. president-elect Donald Trump come as a serious threat to Canada and to our prosperity. That is exactly why we are here tonight, but while this announcement is somewhat unprecedented and obviously worrying, it is not for a moment unexpected. Donald Trump did not appear out of nowhere. He was effectively running for president for four years, most of that time as a front-runner. He made tariffs and trade restrictions a central part of his platform and a central part of his campaign as a whole. The president-elect literally said, “Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented.” Those were his words, but last night's announcement revealed that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not have a plan. He certainly does not have a Canada first plan for our economy or for our security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729949">However, let us look at how the government worked against Canada. It continued with its radical economic vandalism and its job-killing agenda. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continued to hike the carbon tax and raise capital gains taxes, adding piles of red tape on top of an already struggling business sector. He pushed forward with an agenda that doubled home prices. He doubled the national debt. Crime has doubled in this country. Our GDP per capita is smaller now than when the Prime Minister took office. In fact, it dropped more than any other G7 country since COVID. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729950">We have the most indebted households and the worst housing inflation, and food prices have risen 37% faster here than in the U.S., while record numbers of Canadians now visit food banks. That is the Liberals' record. The Canadian economy now stands at record weakness, and we are already at a disadvantage. Businesses were already thinking about leaving, and now it is going to get even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729951"> It is hard to see how anybody might think that we are starting from a negotiating position of strength, and speaking of negotiations, has anybody on that side of the House, anybody in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office or anybody anywhere else thought to continue the relationships with the president-elect's team since 2020? Has anybody thought to build relationships with members of the U.S. House or the U.S. Senate, or with anybody of importance in Washington? We know that the Liberals say it, but it is quite clear that saying it does not make it reality, and could anybody read the writing on the wall to see what was coming?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729952"> I think we know the answers to all those questions, although the Liberals certainly act as though that is not the case, and it is clearer than ever that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has no plan. That is what we are demanding. He had no plan to anticipate the re-election of Donald Trump. He sat around for weeks until these tariffs were announced, and his big idea is a call tomorrow, a bunch of politicians sitting around a table for a photo op.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729953"> We need a Canada first plan. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> reiterated. We needed it yesterday on the economy, on security, on the border and on so much else, but for good measure, let us start with the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729954"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has to now cancel the plan to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre. It was a bad idea then. It is certainly a bad idea now that is going to tax everyone, so we are going to axe the tax on everyone, on everything, forever, and that is going to ensure our prosperity, or at least a stronger negotiating position with the U.S. These tax rises cost more for everything, including food, gas and energy, and combined with those tariffs from Donald Trump, or the threat of those tariffs, they will put our economy six feet under.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729955"> Additionally, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must revoke his plan to place the energy cap on natural resources industries, which would see our country produce 35% less. Natural resources are our biggest job creator and our biggest export. The U.S. wants what we have. Donald Trump says he wants to cut energy prices in half, and he can do that by importing clean Canadian energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729956"> Finally, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must cancel all of the tax increases on work, on investment and on making things here in Canada. They were a bad idea then, and they are certainly a bad idea now. His capital gains increases are going to drive businesses south. They are going to take thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars with them to the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729957"> These common-sense economic policies of axing the tax and scrapping the cap would not only save Canadian jobs; they would also help us in a negotiating position with the United States. They would help reverse the economic vandalism that we have seen after nine years of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, this Liberal-NDP government and the carnage they have caused in the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729958">It goes way past the economy. On immigration, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had already admitted he had broken a generational consensus on immigration, on the system. Every Canadian will tell us that too now. There are 4.9 million temporary visas and permits that have been issued, and they are to expire in December 2025, but yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> practically revealed that there is no plan to ensure that those who overstay their welcome actually go home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729959">The government let in two ISIS terrorists, a father and son duo, plotting an attack about 10 minutes from the riding that I represent. Another one was arrested near Montreal for planning an attack on a Jewish community in New York. The government utterly failed to properly screen the people coming in here. We need a Canada first approach to protect our security and our sovereignty, and to control those who are living in and those who are leaving our country. We need to protect Canadians, to keep our own country safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729960">On top of that, a Canada first plan would put a stop to the out-of-control illegal drugs in this country. There are 47,000 Canadians who have died due to drug overdoses. This is higher than the number of people Canada lost in the Second World War. This number is staggering. There is a 200% increase in overdose deaths after just nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and it is thanks to his radical legalization of drugs and his policies that put continued addiction over hope and recovery. We have talked about it in the House so many times, and it is time for the Prime Minister to finally act on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729961">Today, the police chief in the city of London, in Ontario, confirmed what we have been saying for years: The hard drugs of the Liberal-NDP unsafe supply programs are being diverted into our streets. Last year, the force seized 30,000 hydromorphone pills, most of them sourced directly from these programs. They are flooding into our streets, and they are also flooding across the border into the U.S. We know that. All we have to do is look outside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729962">We must put a stop to our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters, our aunts and uncles falling victim to the poisonous plan the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal-NDP government are pushing. We must end the vast black market transnational trade of dangerous drugs that the Prime Minister has created. The Prime Minister can do that today by immediately announcing he will end his failed, radical, unsafe supply experiment to bring our loved ones home drug-free with detox treatment and wraparound services, and stop funding the drug smugglers and the transnational trade.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="20">(2120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729963">Everyone sees that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot negotiate. Everyone sees that the Prime Minister cannot keep his promises. Everyone sees that the Prime Minister has lost control, not only of his own caucus, of his own party, but of the entire country. The president-elect has opened the door to not implementing these tariffs: As long as we implement the ideas we spoke about tonight, then he implies that the tariffs will not be levied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729964">From there, we find a silver lining. It is because we can fix these issues. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can do that. He can stand up and tell Canadians. He can show up in this debate and tell Canadians he will axe the tax and finally lay out a plan to make sure those who overstay their welcome with their permits live up to their agreements and actually leave this country. He can tell Canadians he will immediately end his unsafe consumption, free drug bonanza. He can do all of those things. The only thing missing in all of this is the Prime Minister and his leadership. He has been here for nine years. He has had three presidents, and he has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729965">If we read Robert Lighthizer's book, which I am sure many of my colleagues will quote tonight, we will know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s first approach with Donald Trump failed, and we cannot afford a second one. He can continue to stick his head in the sand and pretend nothing is wrong. He can continue pushing jobs and money out of this country. The Prime Minister has a choice to make tonight. We as Canadians only hope he makes the right choice, to put Canada first. I know he will not do that, and that is why this country desperately needs an election.</ParaText>

We have even had a trade agreement signed off with president-elect Trump previously. During the negotiations for that particular agreement, when it really came down and started to get difficult, we had the now <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> say to capitulate, to just sign it, to get an agreement, because he was panicking.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8729979"> Madam Speaker, I have no doubt that many Canadians are watching tonight's debate with a great deal of anxiety for the threat that is facing our country and our economy. Jobs, workers' paycheques and the ability for people to pay their mortgage depend on trade. Canada is a nation that depends on being able to sell what we grow and what we produce here to other countries around the world. We simply do not have the population to consume what we can produce. That is because we are so good at producing things. We are so good at extracting our natural resources at the highest environmental and ethical standards. Our skilled trades, machinists and factory workers are so good at what they do that we can produce far more than we need for ourselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729980">Having an extremely long and undefended border, the longest undefended border in the world, being neighbours with a like-minded democracy that was built on the rule of law, human rights and, most importantly, free market capitalism where the voluntary exchange of goods and services, not just between individuals but between our countries, has dramatically increased the quality of life both here and in the United States to such a degree that people from around the world of all different faiths, races, ethnicities and cultures have come to Canada. They do not come to Canada for the weather. They come to Canada because of the opportunity and the basis of our society that we have built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729981">The reason why people are so anxious right now is because they have seen the track record of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in dealing with President-elect Trump. The first time the Prime Minister had to go toe to toe, head to head with President-elect Trump, he was forced to capitulate and accept concession after concession after concession; forced to accept concessions on agricultural products; forced to accept a deal that did not protect Canadian steelworkers from tariffs from the United States; forced to accept a deal that was silent, that did not offer any protection to forestry workers with a softwood lumber deal as part of it; and forced to accept the humiliating concession that the Prime Minister was unable to get an exemption from the buy American provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729982">After such a terrible track record the first time Canada faced tariffs from the U.S. administration, there is good reason to be worried right now. That is just on trade. One of the things that a country can do to protect itself in a potential trade conflict is to make our own economy strong. When investors and business owners are fighting with each other to get into Canadian markets, it is less likely that their home country would want to get in the way of that trade. What the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done is to put Canada in such an incredibly weak position. Our economy was weak yesterday before these potential tariffs were even announced, and now the Prime Minister is heading into a negotiation period in a position of extreme vulnerability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729983">Let us just take a look at some of the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729984"> In Canada, the GDP per capita is now smaller than it was before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. That means the only thing that is even remotely keeping our GDP numbers in a positive trend is the fact that our population is growing, but each individual Canadian is poorer today and produces less value today because of the Prime Minister's terrible economic vandalism. Just look at some of the things that he has done. He has imposed a devastating carbon tax on the Canadian economy. The United States does not have a carbon tax. As he quadruples that carbon tax, the difference between our economy and the U.S. economy will be even larger. Why would an investor say they would like to build something in Windsor and pay 61¢ a litre when they can build that factory in Detroit and pay zero cents a litre for a carbon tax?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8729985"> That is why it is so puzzling that the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>, who pretends to be worried about this issue, consistently supports the Liberal plan to hike, to quadruple, the carbon tax. How many more businesses and jobs, how much more money, will flow south of the border as that carbon tax gets higher? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729986">Food prices have grown 37% faster in Canada than in the United States. That is because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> devalued the Canadian dollar by forcing the Bank of Canada to print hundreds of billions of dollars to cover his deficits and wasteful spending. What happens when we print money out of thin air? We have more dollars chasing fewer goods and prices go up. Inflation has hit food prices here in Canada far worse than in the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729987">Our national debt has grown by over 100% in a decade. That means the government has to go out into markets to borrow money. That is an important fact as well, because when the government borrows money it competes with the private sector. When business owners, factory owners and entrepreneurs go out and borrow some money to start up a business, scale up a business, expand to a second location or add another product line, they have to go out and compete with the government to borrow that money. When the government gobbles up a lot of the available funds, it drives up the borrowing costs for everybody else, including individuals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729988">It is not just large business owners who have to pay higher borrowing costs when the government goes out and scoops up all the available cash for itself. Our mortgage payment is going to be higher because of all that government borrowing. If somebody has a dollar to lend, to lend it to an individual is a greater risk than to lend it to a government entity, which is viewed as having a much more secure backing, so they have to pay a premium to borrow that dollar too. The government's deficits directly have an impact on Canadian borrowers, which include business owners and individuals with mortgages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729989"> Where I am going with all of this is that by weakening the Canadian economy, there are fewer people around the globe fighting to get into Canada. We only need to develop this thought exercise: Would Canada ever slap these kinds of tariffs unilaterally on the United States? Of course not, because it would risk our markets to sell our products into. Canada has a weaker economy, our people are poorer, and there are fewer opportunities here and fewer investments that can turn a profit, add to growth and create jobs, which means there are fewer people in the United States fighting to protect access to our markets. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s devastating and humiliating failure the first time he had to face President Trump is a big reason people are concerned today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729990">A couple of issues aside from economics have been the subject of debate. What I have heard many Canadians asking in the last 24 hours is this: Why did it take the president-elect of the United States to call out the government's inaction on dealing with the fentanyl and opioid crisis? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should want to get fentanyl off our streets for Canadians, out of concern for the grieving mothers, fathers, husbands and wives who have lost people to this horrible addiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729991">We have presented comprehensive plans to help stem the tide of illegal drugs coming into Canada, with more inspections and better tools for law enforcement. The government not only ignores it but doubles down on its failed approach to make bail easier for those criminals. It even went so far as to use the tax dollars of Canadians to fund government-paid-for opioids, which the police say now show up in our communities all the time, all across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729992">At the border, we have had, in the last few months, under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, terrorists associated with al Qaeda and ISIS coming into Canada. It should not take a president of the United States to call attention to that. A Canadian prime minister should want to solve that problem on their own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8729993">All that is to say it is quite clear that what this episode in the last few days has shown us is that we need a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with the brains and the backbone to put Canada first. As the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> said earlier this evening, Canada first, Canada always and Canada forever. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730010">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my good friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278778" Type="2">Vancouver Granville</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730011"> There should be no doubt that the Government of Canada places the highest priority on strengthening our trading relations with the United States. For a place like Surrey Centre, this is in no way undiminished, as we are a border city and a port city. Trade is of vital importance. These are indeed unique relations that are tremendously and mutually beneficial to both our nations. Our partnership is not just forged by our shared geography. It is also shared by our similar values, common interests and strong personal connections, which include family connections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730012">Perhaps most relevant to the subject of our debate today is that our relations are based on deep and powerful economic ties. Millions of jobs depend upon trade and investment between Canada and the United States. We are each other's largest trading partners, with nearly 3.6 billion dollars' worth of goods and services crossing the border each day in 2023. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730013">Our government has worked tirelessly to strengthen and secure the relationship by supporting and helping to ensure the safe flow of goods and people across the border. That is vital to both our countries' economic competitiveness and prosperity, which were key parts of our efforts in securing the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, CUSMA, which went into force in July 2020. This agreement is the anchor for our strong, balanced trading relationship with the United States and the foundation for this relationship is built on the resilience and effective supply chains that carry across all key sectors of the economy. As a result, today, we are each other's largest trade partners with, as I said, nearly 3.6 billion dollars' worth of goods and services crossing the borders each day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730014"> Canada is particularly significant as a secure supplier of energy to the United States' domestic market. Last year, for example, 60% of U.S. crude oil imports originated from Canada. Canada and the U.S. also have a significant investment relationship. The U.S. is the single greatest investor into Canada. These trade and investment relationships support millions of jobs here in Canada. They also support millions of jobs in America. That is because today Canada buys more from the United States than China, Japan and Germany combined. Maintaining and expanding this flow of goods, of investment and of people across the border is absolutely vital for both our countries' economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730015"> By the same token, undermining the effectiveness of this relationship by imposing tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States would take us in the opposite direction. There should be no doubt that imposing a 25% tariff on all Canadian products would be harmful to U.S. consumers, U.S. workers and the U.S. economy as a whole. In fact, roughly 70% of Canadian goods exported to the United States are used in the production of other goods or, as they say, advanced manufacturing by U.S. manufacturers. This means that imports from Canada are effectively feeding the U.S. economy and U.S. industry with vital inputs, making it stronger and more competitive. It also means that putting a 25% tariff on these Canadian imports would impose a massive increase in the input costs on U.S. manufacturers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730016">The harm to American manufacturers would not stop there. That is because American tariffs on Canadian goods would open the door to retaliatory tariffs, and that is something we do not want to do. I have been across several states in the United States over the last nine years as a part of my parliamentary duties, especially during the renegotiations of CUSMA, working with the National Governors Association and the Western Governors' Association. I can assure members that 36 U.S. states currently still rely on Canada as their number one export market and over 40 states export more than 1 billion dollars' worth of goods per year into Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730017">Raising the costs of those goods would not just be bad for Canadian consumers. It would be really bad for American manufacturers and their consumers who depend on those sales. Our government does not want to go down that road. We know that efficient trade is the way to secure strong economies on both sides of the border. We know that because, since 1989, the North American free trade agreements have generated economic growth and rising standards of living for the people of all three member countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730018">The entry into force of NAFTA in 1994 created the largest free trade region in the world, and by strengthening the rules and procedures governing trade investment in North America, the agreement has proven to be a solid foundation for building Canada's prosperity and has set a valuable example of the benefits of trade liberalization for the rest of the world. What did it mean for Canada? It meant that our total merchandise exports to the United States in 2018 reached $438 billion, representing a fourfold increase from the $101 billion in 1989 before this agreement. Such a dramatic expansion of Canadian exports to a single country is unprecedented, and NAFTA's most recent successor has made us even stronger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730019">We can see, in clear and unequivocal terms, how free and fair trade between Canada and the United States benefits both countries. We are communicating these points and signalling to the incoming administration our readiness to work together to advance our shared economic prosperity and security. In doing so, we will remain open to the perspectives of our American partners. In fact, we share many of those perspectives. We share U.S. concerns regarding unfair competition and global market distortions, including overcapacity caused by non-market policies and practices that harm our workers and businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730020">We can assure our American partners that Canada will not be a transshipment risk or a vector for trade practices that would harm our collective economic security. To take just one example, Canada imposed a 100% surtax in October on electric vehicles and a 25% surtax on steel and aluminum products from China. Canada is considering additional surtaxes on imports of batteries and battery parts, semiconductors, solar products and critical minerals from China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730021"> We will always defend Canada's interests and do what is best for Canadians and the Canadian economy. We will always do so with the understanding that Canada and the U.S. have a unique relationship and partnership. This partnership works best, creating jobs, economic growth and shared prosperity on both sides of the border, when we work together in common purpose and understanding. </ParaText>

Brian Mulroney, another great leader of the Conservative Party, jumped in. They acted not in a manner that was detrimental to Canada but in a manner that was supportive. I think those days of Conservative leadership are long gone. The new leadership is more about themselves, as we have seen with other matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730033"> I thank the member and their party for continuing to show the support for Canada to be strong in this. The Americans would have to capitulate to their own tariffs at the end of the day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730036">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the House today, as it always is, as we speak in this important debate about the prospect of the tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump. This is an important moment for our country, and it is an important moment for us to reflect on so we respond in a way that is beneficial not just to Canadians but to our shared North American prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730037">Canada and the United States have a strong and unbreakable relationship that dates back centuries, and when it comes down to this conversation, it is important to start with the facts. We know in Canada that our biggest market is the United States, and the economic prosperity and future of both governments are predicated on the idea that we must work together, because our economies are intrinsically linked and entirely intertwined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730038">Canada has much to be proud of. We are a world leader from batteries to clean energy and from AI to agriculture. We are a place where investors from around the world want to place bets. They want to be here and be part of the growth happening in Canada. Indeed, Canada is set to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730039">There are also concerns we all share about making sure we have a safe and secure border and that our communities are safe and secure. We are all working hard to do that, and we are working with the Americans, as we have always done, to ensure that our border is safe. For our government, standing up to meet domestic and international challenges is not just about partisan politics; it is about working together and having a united approach as Canadians. It worked for us in 2016 and it will work in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730040">After all, our shared prosperity is built on a set of facts and the facts are clear. In 2023, bilateral trade between our two countries was worth $1.3 trillion, which is about $3.4 billion in trade every single day. For 36 U.S. states, Canada is the number one market. The U.S. is our top merchandising trading partner, with over half a trillion dollars of Canada's merchandise being sent in 2025. The U.S. is the single greatest investor in Canada. In 2022, stock investment was worth over half a trillion dollars, representing half of all investment in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730041">This is a generational relationship, not one crafted overnight. It was built over successive governments of all political parties, because we have taken an approach that working together is the right way to share and build prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730042">As we think about those facts, it is important to remember a couple of things. From the opposition we see bluster, paranoia and, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said earlier, people “freaking out”. That is not what Canadians need. They need to see strong, calm and resolute leadership predicated on the idea that when we craft a good deal, we do not need a winner and loser. If we build together correctly with our American friends, we will build shared prosperity in a win-win situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730043">That is the approach our government has always taken. It is the approach we take to everything we do. A rising tide lifts all boats, and that is the approach we intend to take in working with the incoming U.S. administration. It means having meaningful conversations, as the Prime Minister has already done with President-elect Trump. It does not mean gaslighting Canadians and making idle threats, and it certainly does not mean raising panic. It means working hard on the challenges we face and share and building on our common interests. That is how we get over the finish line on these matters, just as we have done in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730044">Whether regarding security, technology or natural resources, our economies are inextricably linked. These tariffs hurt us all. They do not only penalize Canada; they penalize U.S. consumers by making goods more expensive for Americans. Whether it is food, auto parts or energy, all of these things will have an impact on Americans, just as they would on Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730045">When we look at how to come through this period of opportunity and challenge, it is important for us to remember that the best approach we can have is not to tear Canada down or to approach this from a position of weakness, because we are not in a position of weakness. We are partners with our American friends, as we have been and will be for generations. If we take that approach and take pride in what Canada is, in who we are and in our resources and intellectual capacities, we have the ability to do anything.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730046">Putting Canada first is always going to be our government's priority, but putting Canada first does not mean it has to be at the detriment of our friends and neighbours. In fact, putting Canada first means success not just for Canadians but for our American friends as well. A strong Canadian economy is good for the United States just as a strong U.S. economy is good for Canada, if we do the work together to ensure that our shared priorities are considered and that the concerns each of our countries has are reflected in the decisions we make, and if we are prepared to have difficult conversations with one another. That is what we have always done. Empty slogans get us nowhere. Being negative gets us nowhere. What gets us somewhere is rolling up our sleeves and doing the hard work that is required to get to good deals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730047">I spent years living in the United States; I studied there. Some of my best friends are Americans, and I have had the privilege to understand, by working in the United States and in Canada, that we have so much in common. We all want to do well for our communities and our families. We want to build national prosperity, but we also want to look out for our friends and neighbours. We want to make sure the people we care about are taken care of, which is an important principle as we enter into conversations and build a team Canada approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730048">This is a time for us to put aside differences and to focus on what is important. What is important is to make sure Canadian interests are protected; to understand our shared interests; to understand the areas of opportunity for both countries; and to build, with resolution, into those areas of strength and opportunity. In so doing, we will strengthen our economy, the U.S. economy and, as we look at North America, the Mexican economy. We will build a strong economic ecosystem that allows for small and large businesses to prosper and allows for Canadians, Americans and Mexicans to prosper. Most important, we will continue to share those things we have in common while also celebrating the things that make Canada unique. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730049">That is why we have already started the work, working with our premiers from coast to coast to coast and engaging with the incoming administration in the United States. Our job is to work for Canadians. Our job is to make sure Canadians see a government that is capable of handling difficult situations with measured, thoughtful responses, by showing that in conversations and being willing to listen to points of view that are different from ours, but never backing down on things that matter most to Canadians and to our prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730050">The point I would emphasize is that our history is clear. Our history has been one of getting good deals done in the interests of Canada. The Conservatives' record on this is suspect at best; they would capitulate at every turn. Our track record is one of making sure Canadians are protected, but done in a way that the partners with whom we do these deals also feel they are benefiting, which is how good deals get done. Good deals are done when people respect one another, talk about the things that need to get done and do them together. It is an important lesson for all of us in the House as we engage in this debate. Perhaps the most important lesson we should all take away from tonight's conversation is the deep care that all of us are showing in ensuring Canada's interests are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730051">What I think is different is that many of us, certainly all of us on this side of the House, believe that putting Canada's interests first means being able to work with others, to have difficult conversations, to negotiate, to be strong in our values and to put those values at the centre of every conversation we have. Economic prosperity is built on the idea, ultimately, that we take the best of who we are, we support that, we grow and we prosper on the backs, on the intellect and on the hearts and minds of every Canadian from coast to coast to coast. Our businesses, big and small, have a role to play in this conversation, as do American businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730052">It is my hope and aspiration, and I certainly think it is everyone's on this side of the House, that by taking a team Canada approach, by showing a unified front and a willingness to negotiate and work hard without compromising what is important to Canada, we will create a win-win-win situation for all of our partners in North America.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730068">Let us go back 10 years ago, to 2014. On April 30, 2014, The New York Times published an article entitled “Life in Canada, Home of the World’s Most Affluent Middle Class.” The article stated that “median income in Canada appears to have surpassed median income in the United States, based on more than three decades of international income surveys analyzed”. That was in April 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730069">We can then fast-forward almost a decade, to 2022, when the current government had been in power for six years. On April 8 of that year, in 2022, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> delivered her budget, budget 2022, and in that budget, the government published a chart on page 25 entitled “Average Potential Annual Growth in Real GDP per capita, Selected OECD Countries, 2020-2060”.

              <ParaText id="8730082">Subsequent to that analysis in Policy Options, many, many other experts rang the alarm bell about Canada's faltering economy, people like the former governor of the Bank of Canada David Dodge, the former Liberal finance minister John Manley and former policy and budget director to former finance minister Bill Morneau, Robert Asselin. However, despite all the warnings coming from experts across the country in academia and in political and policy circles, the government failed to heed the warnings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730083">This year, the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, Carolyn Rogers, added to these warnings. With respect to Canada's economy, on March 26 she noted that productivity improved in the U.S. economy coming out of the pandemic, but that this had not happened in Canada. It was quite the opposite. She noted that Canada's productivity is unchanged from where it was seven years ago. In fact, she issued this very stark warning: “You know those signs that say ‘In an emergency, break the glass’? Well, it's time to break the glass.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730084">This is very strong language coming from a central banker. Canada's central bank is saying publicly that we are in an economic emergency. It is using the word “emergency”. It is saying that Canada is falling behind other countries because of weak business investment, a lack of competition and a failure to integrate new immigrants into the workforce, all of which are responsibilities of the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730107">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to a truly vital issue this evening. Over the past nine years, a number of yellow flags have been raised by our NATO partners, members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the defence industry. Now, our number-one defence partner, the United States of America, has raised a huge red flag. </ParaText>

It has had enough of Canada always trying to avoid paying its fair share in terms of military obligations.

Members on this side of the House have brought these issues to the Prime Minister's attention many times. Maybe this time, he will do something. There are so many things I could bring up this evening to demonstrate just how incompetent this Prime Minister and his ministers have been. I will focus on the disaster this government caused at National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730110">Where do we start? For nine years, we have been criticizing the Liberals for making big promises on this file, on defence, and then failing to keep their promises every time. They keep deferring spending and deferring funds for goods and equipment to future years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730111">Significantly, the Liberals have also changed the rules of the game when it comes to defence spending. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, reported defence spending increased by approximately $7 billion in 2017 over the previous fiscal year, but only because of NATO's more flexible guidance on what constitutes defence spending. As a result, Canada's numbers on spending came to include measures not previously considered defence spending. Veterans' benefits and expenditures on the Canadian Coast Guard, peacekeeping and DND IT support are now part of Canada's NATO calculation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730112">In other words, the Liberals created $7 billion in new spending out of thin air. As a result, any comparison between the current government's spending and that of the Harper government is like comparing apples to oranges. Canada is now the only NATO country that is not meeting its two investment pledges: to invest at least 2% of its GDP in defence and to invest at least 20% of its defence budget in new equipment and R and D.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730113">The Liberals cut the Canadian Armed Forces' budget by nearly $1 billion, despite their promise not to do so, and yet the 2023 budget specifically promised to exempt the Canadian Armed Forces from the government's spending review. Let us remember that, in budget 2023, the current <Affiliation DbId="300030" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>, the former defence minister, asked all departments to start being more careful and making budget cuts, but there was an exemption for the Canadian Armed Forces. Despite all this, $1 billion was cut from the Department of National Defence's budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730114">Last year, the former chief of the defence staff, Wayne Eyre, said it was impossible to cut almost $1 billion from the defence budget without that having an impact. He went on to say that it was an issue the department was facing, and that he had had a very difficult session with the commanding officers of the different branches as they tried to explain this to their people. Those people knew the security situation was deteriorating around the world, so trying to explain it to them was very difficult.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730121">Madam Speaker, my colleague from Jonquière must be following what is going on right now and why the new U.S. president-elect is threatening to impose 25% tariffs. These are the consequences related to border management and drug trafficking. Canada's national defence, which is a bit player as far as the Americans are concerned, only adds to the friction. That is why we are taking stock of Canada's military situation in relation to our partnership with the Americans. It is part of our overall national security. That is why Canada is currently being criticized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730122">According to the Public Accounts, the Liberals have let billions of dollars in defence spending fall by the wayside since 2015. This essentially means that through their mismanagement, they have failed to spend the billions of dollars that were allocated for national defence. Only 58% of the Canadian Armed Forces would be able to respond to a crisis if called upon by NATO allies today. Nearly half of all military equipment is considered unavailable and unusable. This is one reason why the American president is fed up. It seems pretty clear to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730123">The Liberals ended up choosing the F-35s to replace the aging CF-18s, but that happened only after several years of mismanagement and political interference in the procurement process. That is something else the Americans are sick of. Richard Shimooka of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute described this situation as disastrous in a 2019 report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730124">For our part, when we were in power, we took our military obligations seriously. For example, we quickly acquired five C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, 17 CC‑130J Hercules transport aircraft, 15 Chinook helicopters, some Leopard tanks. We modernized the CP-140 surveillance aircraft, as well as the Halifax class frigates, and so on. That made our American colleagues happy. We were with them in Afghanistan to fight against the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730125">Retired Lieutenant-General Andrew Leslie said something about Canada's ailing military. Let us not forget that he was a Liberal member for four years. He did not seek reelection because he understood the problem I am talking about. He said that in the past decade, the Liberals “spent more money on consultants and professional services than it did on the Army, Navy and Air Force combined”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730126">Here are a few facts. We have fewer than 35 personnel deployed on UN missions, compared with almost 2,500 in 2003. We are the only NATO country whose level of military operational readiness is falling, while all the others' readiness levels are soaring. We have the longest and least efficient supply system in NATO, of all member countries, in fact. We are the only NATO country without a concrete plan to reach 2% of GDP, a target that was agreed to by the Minister of Defence in 2008, reiterated in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and I could go on. We are the only NATO country whose defence minister has publicly admitted that he failed to convince his cabinet colleagues of the importance of NATO defence spending and the 2% GDP target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730127">“This is borderline atrocious”: That is a quote from Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, for those who were here in 2016 and 2017. Members will remember Admiral Norman. Vice-Admiral Norman said, “Readiness is all about measuring the ability of your armed forces to do what it is they're expected to do. And fundamentally, that's all about going somewhere and fighting. And, you know, it's a pretty dire situation when you're...not where you need to be”. What Admiral Norman was basically saying is that we need to be ready for combat. We always need to be ready for any deployment we are asked to do. That is not happening now. We are not ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730128">The Liberal government has a disastrous record on national defence. Canadian forces members have not had any leadership in 10 years.

They cut a billion dollars from the budget, even though the President of the Treasury Board said that the government would not normally touch National Defence. They made cuts. Some $7 billion was added, and it has been going down ever since. They are talking nonsense.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730149">I would be remiss if I did not recognize the fact that it there was an election tonight in Nova Scotia. Tim Houston, who was the premier going into the election, was re-elected with a majority mandate. I would like to congratulate him on his successful election. I would also like to congratulate Zach Churchill, the leader of the Liberal Party, as well as Claudia Chender and all the candidates who put their names forward in Nova Scotia. I think we, as elected members of Parliament, can certainly respect and understand the importance of people putting their names forward for democracy. I look forward to working with all the newly elected and re-elected members of the legislative assembly in Nova Scotia, in Kings—Hants and across Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730150">This is a crucial debate. Obviously, I think that any concept of tariffs on the most integrated economies in the world is problematic. The proposal would not only hurt the Canadian economy, it would hurt the American economy and consumers on both sides of the border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730151">We do not have a whole lot to work with as parliamentarians, as has been reported and has been put out by the president-elect on his social media channels. He has alluded to the fact that, in his first day of office, once assuming it on January 20, 2025, he would put a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports into the United States. It is worth noting that the Canada-U.S. relationship is one of the most unique in the world. We share the longest undefended border, and we have nearly 3 billion dollars' worth of products and services being traded between our two countries on any given day. That represents nearly a trillion dollars of trade. There is no country in the world that matches that reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730152"> I saw the president-elect's remarks. We, I think, as Canadian parliamentarians, want to work with the incoming administration. The Republican Party and President-elect Trump were elected in the United States. At the same time, we need to be able to find a pathway to work with that new administration and understand how we can get to an outcome that is going to be satisfactory for citizens on both sides of the border because it should be in the vested interests of any parliamentarian or any member of congress to get that outcome. We serve the people. We serve our citizens here in Canada, and this is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730153">The debate tonight is a debate about presumably the impact of what these tariffs would represent, as well as how the Government of Canada responds, but I would argue how members of Parliament in the House should respond because the government has a responsibility, but so too do we. Every elected member of a Canadian constituency has a responsibility to represent Canada's interests and, of course, be the voice for our people here in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730154">I want to break my remarks down tonight into a few different categories. I want to start by talking about the economic relationship, but I also want to talk about defence and national security. I want to talk about a North American continental approach. I also want to talk about a team Canada approach and how we should go about this relationship over the next couple of months. However, I will start with the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730155">I believe that, for 32 out of the 50 states in the United States, their most important trading partner is Canada, which would be 64% of the United States. We have a deep economic relationship. In fact, in Canada, 75% of our exports, whether in goods or in services, go to the United States. We as a government, and many previous federal governments, look at diversifying trade as a good thing. Of course, we want to partner around the world, but we cannot get around the facts that we have one of the most advanced economies in the world right on the our doorstep and that our relationships are integral and connected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730156">With talk of a 25% tariff on Canadian products, while I am not suggesting that the government should do this right away, if there was no movement on this issue between now and January 20, 2025, any reasonable government in the country would have to respond at some point to protect our national interests. That would just lead to impacts on both sides of the border about business interests and the impact on communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="45">(2245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730157">We have been here before. This government has managed a rocky Canada-U.S. relationship. Throughout our history, since Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, there have always been times throughout the relationship where relations can be strained, but we know that even in those times, the Canada-U.S. relationship must prevail because of the shared interests and values we have between our two countries, the protection of freedom, democracy and liberty and the promotion of western liberal democracy across the world. It will be incumbent on all members of Parliament in this place to engage with their congressional colleagues on Capitol Hill to remind them about the importance of the economic relationship, a two-way relationship that benefits Canada and the United States equally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730158">I want to talk a bit about the resources that Canada has that can benefit the United States. We wake up every morning thinking about the United States and their importance in a continental relationship. The United States is one of the largest countries in the world and, arguably, the most powerful country in the world. The U.S. may not think about Canada in the same way that we think about it every morning. I think of the importance of critical minerals, not only on the reduction of emissions and in the context of climate change but also in the context of defence and security. We possess the critical minerals the United States needs. The other critical mineral superpower in the world is China. We know from the relationship and the way in which both Democratic nominee for president, Kamala Harris, and President-elect Donald Trump have approached this that there is a concern around China's influence in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730159">Canada has the critical minerals that the United States needs. We have seen investments by the Department of National Defence in Canada's north in partnership with Canadian companies alongside our government to make sure we build a supply chain that will work in a North American context. A 25% tariff, at the heart, goes directly against this type of thinking and would not be helpful to the American interests across the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730160">When we talk about energy, Canada is an energy superpower. We should be deeply proud of that, whether it be our oil and gas sector, renewables or other forms of energy. Nuclear energy is also a key opportunity to partner in deeper integration with the United States. The United States needs our energy market. I had the opportunity at the Halifax International Security Forum to have a conversation with a representative from Amazon. Amazon is looking at artificial intelligence and deep data centres as a way to help drive its business, as well as innovations that are going to be needed around the world, but it needs renewable energy to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730161">Canadians listening at home tonight would be proud to know that Canada is one of the best grids in the world from an electricity perspective. Nearly 86% of our electricity that is generated is emissions-free. It leads the world. It is a tremendous opportunity and competitive advantage. As American companies look to expand their footprint in the digital space, whether it be in Quebec, British Columbia or across this country, we are well positioned to capitalize upon that, but 25% tariffs do not help in that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730162">In the integrated market, on any given day, whether it is a company in Kings—Hants, Nova Scotia, Etobicoke—Lakeshore or Surrey, British Columbia, we have companies that do business across borders and vice versa. There are great American companies that provide products and services that we need in this country, so we cannot look at this from an and/or perspective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730163">I listened to questions in question period today and heard the Conservatives using the words “Canada first”. Any member of Parliament in this place wants to place Canadian national interests at the top of what we advocate for every day, but that type of thinking plays into an isolationist type of view that I do not think is beneficial when we are talking about the Canada-U.S. relationship. We have to be talking about partnership. Every time the Conservatives stand in this place and talk about Canada first, we should be talking about North American advantage and how Canada can co-operate. That puts Canadian interests at the heart of what we are doing alongside the Americans in a global context. I want to talk about that in an economic sense, but we need to talk about defence and national security.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="50">(2250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730164"> I submit that the world is probably the most dangerous it has been in the last 100 years. We have war in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, provoked by Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation. We have war in the Middle East, and I was pleased to see a ceasefire today between Israel and Hezbollah. That is important news, but again, there remains instability in that region, and we have a rise of authoritarian governments around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730165">Again, I bring members back to my experience at the Halifax International Security Forum. One of the panels this weekend in Halifax was on the CRINKs, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, and their involvement in the world. They are not out to protect and promote democratic values. They are out to do the opposite, and Canada has an interesting role to play in the world here. We have to promote the ability for western liberal democracies to succeed in this challenge that we are facing, which is, again, the most dangerous world we have seen in 100 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730166">That bears upon a responsibility for Canada and the United States to take a leadership role in the world, and the way we do that is by working together. It is not by putting up walls or tariff barriers between us. It is by looking at ways that we can further integrate our economies and ways that we can co-operate in the interests of national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730167"> I think it took a bit too long, but I fully support the fact that the government has committed to a 2% target on NATO. It is going to require billions of dollars between now and 2032 to scale up to that amount. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278340" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation> and I were in Washington in July as part of the NATO conference, and we had these conversations alongside congressional leaders in the House and in the Senate about the ways Canada can be a key partner in NATO.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730168">Madam Speaker, do you know what is concerning? I heard the shadow critic for defence today stand up in the House. It was the first time I had seen in a long time that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> allowed him to speak in this place, and he asked questions on defence. The Conservatives love to beat their chests on the defence question. They had defence spending under 1% when they left office in 2015, and they have not yet committed to the 2% target, so my question to my hon. colleagues on the other side of the House is when they will formally commit to the 2% and help work and push this government to do more on defence spending, because not only is it a moral imperative in the world that we are facing right now, but it is going to be an extremely important element in terms of that relationship with the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730169"> When we talk to Republican congressional leaders, they will be engaging with the president-elect about the importance of U.S. influence in foreign policy, but they will be saying NATO countries have to step up and deliver sooner on their commitments. The government is starting on that path. The opposition should be joining us and saying they fully commit to 2%, but I do not hear a lick out of them in relation to foreign policy. They do not talk about it. They do not talk about their view in the world, and I think it is probably incumbent on them, if they think they are the government-in-waiting, to start talking about how they view the world and Canada's role in the world, particularly as it relates to defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730170"> I just want to take an opportunity to talk about the team Canada approach. This is extremely important. We saw the premiers write to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and talk about the importance of bringing the premiers of the provinces and territories together. We have to be united in a team Canada approach. I know we can have partisan debates in here. I just took a bit of a shot at the Conservatives on the opposite side, but I did so in good faith, hoping and knowing that at the end of the day, Canada's interests should come ahead of any partisan interests in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730171"> We are in a critical moment, and I think it is incumbent on the government, to the extent that it can find goodwill across this House, to build consensus and to go to Washington and make sure we are advocating for Canada's interests as a united team Canada, alongside the premiers. I think that should include the provinces. We have seen Premier Ford, and we have seen Premier Wab Kinew and Premier Danielle Smith talk about their desire to get to Washington and to Capitol Hill. That is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730172"> Canada is a big federation. We have regional interests that may differ, or there may be particular strategic assets, depending on whether someone is in the Atlantic or if they are in British Columbia, the west, Ontario or Quebec, that may differ in terms of how they want to engage in this relationship, but we have to do it in an aligned approach. I think that is incumbent on all members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="55">(2255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730173">We should be thinking about our work and our ability to travel to Capitol Hill and engage constructively with our American colleagues in Congress about the ways we can work together. We need to build those relationships. It is muscle memory. We need to be able to spend time on Capitol Hill. Some of us do this very well. There may be others who have never actually taken the opportunity to go to Washington. It is important that we do that and that we invite our American colleagues to come to Ottawa, so we can reinforce the partnership that we have together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730174"> The last item is regarding industry and key stakeholders. This is going to be important. The cross-border business relationship needs to be reinforced, and we have to find symmetry regarding ways that we can create wins for industry in both the United States and Canada. I believe there is a window and a great opportunity to do more of that, and we should view this relationship not as a contentious one or one that is a threat to Canada. I know a 25% opening conversation on tariffs is problematic, but we should view this as an opportunity in terms of how we can further deepen the relationship and build wins on both sides of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730175">It would be irresponsible of me not to talk about the agriculture question. I chair the House of Commons agriculture committee, and I want to talk a little about some of the cross-border wins that I just alluded to. We need to be identifying harmonization of policies that are wins for our Canadian agriculture sector and the U.S. sector as well. I want to give one example, which is Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>; I think it is by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation>. It is in the House. I am deeply disappointed that the Senate has amended the bill, notwithstanding that it was agreed to with 323 votes to 1 in this place. It will be coming back to the House, and I would ask the House to reject that amendment. Furthermore, if the bill is going to be delayed, it is absolutely responsible for the government to take the contents of the bill and put it in some type of economic legislation. We are mired in a question of privilege, and things are blocked here in the House. However, there are important pieces of legislation that we have to get through for the Canada-U.S. relationship and for Canadians; Bill C-280 would be one of those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730176"> I think about opportunities around the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and the EPA and ways that they can share information to be able to drive questions around crop management and crop protection products and approvals. That is an easy win that I presume a Republican administration would see as straightforward policy that we could also sell on our side of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730177"> I think about the ability to align on the standardization around standards and what products are actually marketed under. That is something we could align in a North American context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730178"> Around wilderness protection, people in the United States, regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans, are big on protecting nature and natural lands. We can also find bipartisan or multipartisan consensus here in Canada around protecting natural landscapes. Those are things that we could do together in alignment in an international context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730179">I want to talk about Nova Scotia quickly. We are fortunate to be exempted from the forestry tariffs that have been discussed in the House. As an entire Parliament, we need to continue to lean in on that question. The forestry sector matters to this country, and we should be there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730180"> The president-elect mentioned two things in his post yesterday: fentanyl and the border. I would hazard a guess that any member of Parliament in this place wants to tackle the question of fentanyl and the impact of drug abuse in this country. We are all standing there, and the government can do more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730181">Certainly with respect to the border and any immigration mechanisms, we can make sure we give confidence to the incoming administration that by no means should there be a 25% tariff on our products. It would hurt American industry, and we can work with the incoming administration to make sure that we have partnership.</ParaText>

I was listening to a CBS News report from about a week ago, which talked about the border. A 295-mile part of the border between Canada and the United States includes New York, Vermont and New Hampshire. In 2023, 19,000 illegals were captured crossing that border, and 321 were on the United States terrorist watch-list. This is exactly the problem.

              <ParaText id="8730215">I rise in the House today with great concern for the future of our economy, particularly in the key sectors of aluminum and softwood lumber, which are essential to the prosperity of Quebec and our regions. These industries support thousands of families and workers in Quebec. However, today, they are being threatened by a series of economic factors as a result of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730216">Quebec's aluminum industry produces roughly 30% of the world's aluminum, but it is vulnerable to unfair competition, mainly due to the infiltration of cheap Chinese aluminum. Our Quebec producers, who comply with strict environmental standards and invest in cleaner production, are being penalized by this unfair competition. Similarly, the softwood lumber industry, which contributes approximately $12 billion to the Canadian economy, is under constant pressure from countervailing duties imposed by the United States, which are making an already difficult situation for our producers even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730217">Yesterday, President-elect Trump announced that he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian products. This decision will have a direct impact on the aluminum and softwood lumber sectors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="15">(2315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730218">These new tariffs will only increase production costs for our companies, making them less competitive and potentially putting thousands of jobs on the line in Quebec. This announcement is a major blow to industries already facing difficulties, yet the Liberal government has still not implemented any concrete measures to protect our workers and producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730219">What is even more shocking is that these threats were predictable. President-elect Trump has been talking about the possibility of 25% tariffs on Canadian products for years, even during his election campaign. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Deputy Prime Minister were caught off guard. Just a few days ago, the <Affiliation DbId="278943" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was asserting that Canada would be fine. Clearly, neither she nor the Prime Minister were following what the president-elect was saying. This government is clearly incapable of anticipating the economic threats we face. This government's inability to defend our economic interests has continually weakened our industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730220">Clearly, what the Liberals are best at is weakening our economy and attacking our forestry industry. We saw that this summer with their threat to impose an order, supposedly to protect woodland caribou. In reality, experts cannot say for certain whether this order will protect caribou. One thing they can confirm, however, is that it will kill our forestry industry. The order that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> wants to impose on the region will jeopardize 1,400 forestry jobs in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and on the north shore. Worse still, the mayor of Sacré‑Cœur says that her municipality depends on logging and will turn into a ghost town if the order goes through. I should point out that the Bloc Québécois is complicit in all this. Bloc members voted twice to keep the current Prime Minister in place, leaving him free to impose an order that will be devastating for the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730221">That is not all. We recently saw three sawmills close their doors in Quebec, including the one in Saint‑Ludger‑de‑Milot in my region, leaving 100 workers out on the street in a village with a population of 600. The closure was blamed on the high price of softwood lumber. All of this is due to the government's inability to negotiate an agreement on softwood lumber, to protect our forestry workers and to use a bit of common sense before presenting policies that are disconnected from the realities of Quebec's regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730222">We have been under this government for nine years now. There have been three U.S. presidents, but there is still no agreement on softwood lumber. In contrast, the previous Conservative prime minister managed to get one signed 80 days after he was elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730223">Another critically important sector in my region is aluminum. It is essential that we eliminate the carbon tax, which is overburdening producers by increasing their production costs and compromising their competitiveness. This tax must be eliminated to ensure that our businesses can remain competitive on the international market, especially in the face of competitors who are not subject to similar constraints. It is also imperative that we cancel all tax hikes for producers and workers. Our businesses are facing major challenges, and the additional tax burden is only making matters worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730224">My riding is home to Rio Tinto and several other companies that supply the aluminum industry in the region. However, this sector is being threatened by Chinese products that are produced with no environmental standards and no protection for workers. Unlike the Prime Minister, my <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> understands that aluminum is an economic driver in my region. In fact, he was in Saguenay this summer to talk about his proposals for protecting our Canadian aluminum.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="20">(2320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730225">A common-sense government will impose tariffs on Chinese aluminum to protect jobs in Saguenay and to protect the environment as well. As I said, my region produces the cleanest aluminum in the world. Every tonne of aluminum produced in Saguenay reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We produce two tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions for every tonne of aluminum. In China, it is 14 tonnes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730226">The tax hikes that Canadian companies are subject to make our producers less competitive and slow down innovation. We need to reduce the tax burden so that our industries can grow, hire staff and continue to produce in Canada. The role of government is to defend the interests of our workers and our industries. However, in the Liberal era, this government has consistently been reactive rather than proactive. Not only are we suffering the consequences of weak leadership, but we are also suffering the consequences of decisions that were made without any serious consultation with the sectors involved. Our key industries, such as aluminum and softwood lumber, deserve a government that anticipates challenges, faces them head-on and protects our jobs, our families and our economic future. In addition to these economic issues, it is clear that the Liberal government's weakness in managing our borders and our country's security contributed to Donald Trump's threat to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730227">Conservatives have always advocated for concrete action to secure our borders and fight these threats while protecting our economy. Our vital industries like aluminum and lumber deserve a government that acts to protect the jobs and competitiveness of Canadian businesses. We must stand up for our workers, our companies and our economic future in the face of these external threats. The time has come to put an end to Liberal inaction and take concrete action to ensure Quebec and Canada are prosperous. Canada first. It is time for an election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730237">First, it is thanks to the Bloc Québécois that there was a special committee on caribou, a special committee on the environment. I hope that he will acknowledge that. Second, the reason why aluminum from Saguenay—Lac‑Saint‑Jean is particularly competitive is that it is clean aluminum, as he says, or low-carbon aluminum. What would be the point of not having a price on carbon? That would put us at a disadvantage. Not having a price on carbon would put the aluminum smelters in Saguenay—Lac‑Saint‑Jean at a disadvantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730238">What my colleague is saying is that we need to get rid of carbon pricing, the United States needs to make aluminum from coal and that would be great. It is rather inconsistent of him to say in his speech that we have the greenest aluminum but there should not be a price on carbon. How can we be competitive if we do not put a price on carbon? I would like him to explain that to me.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278504" Type="2">Mr. Kyle Seeback (Dufferin—Caledon, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8730246"> Madam Speaker, tonight we are having an emergency debate to discuss proposed 25% tariffs by the President-elect of the United States. We have to ask ourselves, “How did we get here?” The answer to that question is, “It is because the Liberals have so badly managed our relationship with the United States over the past nine years.” I could speak for two or three hours about that, but I only have 10 minutes, so I will only be able to address a few of these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730247"> The first one is softwood lumber. We have had a softwood lumber dispute, unresolved by these Liberals, for the last nine years. As a result of this, we have lost tens of thousands of jobs in the forestry sector, and over $9 billion in duties has been collected by the United States. That $9 billion could have been used to invest in new equipment, new machinery, new sawmills, new technology and new jobs for Canadian workers. Instead, sawmills have closed and Canadian workers have lost their jobs, many of them unionized workers. These were good-paying jobs. They have all gone down to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730248"> Now, I understand why the United States is doing that, because they are trying to protect their workers. The question is, why has the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> repeatedly failed to protect Canadian workers? That is just on softwood lumber. Those tariffs total, on average, the countervailing and anti-dumping duties, about 15%, and it has wreaked havoc on Canadian workers. Now, we can only imagine what the proposed tariff of 25% would do to forestry workers from coast to coast to coast across Canada. That is failure number one, and the old saying is the sequel is always worse than the original.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730249">The original failure by the government has been on softwood lumber. It is a horror movie in and of itself. However, the sequels actually just keep getting worse. The effect on Canadian workers is bad enough, but Canadians in general suffer the consequences of a Prime Minister who has incompetently managed the relationship with our largest trading partner. Let us remember, the trading relationship with the United States accounts for 40% of our GDP. It is the most important trading relationship that we have in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730250"> A Prime Minister really only has a few core responsibilities, one of which is to keep Canadians safe. We know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has miserably failed on this. Violent crime is surging, people are out on parole five minutes after they have committed a crime. That has been an abject failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730251"> The other very important thing is to maintain the trading relationship with the United States. Once again, the Liberal Prime Minister has been an absolute failure and a disaster. We start with softwood lumber, it is still not resolved nine years later, tens of thousands of jobs have been lost, and billions of dollars worth of tariffs have been collected, to the detriment of Canadian workers and Canadian industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730252">From there we fast-forward, to 2018, when the United States under then-President Trump, imposed 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. Now, we have to ask ourselves, “Why did they impose those tariffs?” Well, it is actually pretty interesting because it was about the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730253">In 2018, it was about the border, and in 2024, these proposed tariffs are about the border. History repeats itself when there is an incompetent government. The 232 tariffs were actually because Chinese steel and aluminum were coming into Canada and being diverted down into the United States, taking away American jobs and American steel production. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730254">The Americans tried to warn us about this, repeatedly. I know this from my consultations with the steel and the aluminum industry. They were asking for Canada to come up with a way to deal with this, the anti-circumvention methods of bringing Chinese steel in through Canada and flooding into the United States.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="35">(2335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8730255"> Guess what. The incompetent <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the incompetent Liberal government did absolutely nothing, despite repeated requests from the United States to clean up the border and stop allowing the steel to come in, so it imposed punishing 232 tariffs on Canadian industries. We lost jobs in our steel industry and lost jobs in our aluminum industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730256">I know the government will say it brought tariffs in against the United States, etc., but the whole thing could have been avoided if it had not so incompetently managed the relationship with our largest trading partner. Because of how the government behaved, the United States put punishing tariffs on our steel and aluminum industry, which caused all kinds of damage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730257">Again, who are the ones that suffer from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s incompetence? It is not him. He continues to live his lavish lifestyle, but the workers, the unionized workers in particular, are the ones who suffer and lose their jobs when a Prime Minister so incompetently manages the largest trading relationship we have in our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730258">That is the interesting thing, that the 2018 tariffs were about a border issue. One would think that even a government as incompetent as the Liberal government would realize that maybe we should make sure we are taking care of our border with our largest trading partner and not treating it as an irritant, but the government does not. It just continues to bumble along and mismanage the relationship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730259">Where do we end up? We end up with a situation now where there is the potential of punishing 25% tariffs being levied against all goods coming into the United States. This would have an unbelievably devastating effect on the Canadian economy. One of the reasons, again, is the issues on the border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730260">Before I spoke tonight, I had the opportunity to watch a news report from a CBS affiliate in the United States. The report talked about 295 miles of border between Canada and the United States that encompasses New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, and said that the number of arrests that are being made by the U.S. border services is skyrocketing. Seven thousand people entered the United States illegally and were arrested in 2023, from just this 295-mile stretch of border. In 2024, according to the report I watched tonight, that number is up to 19,000. These are 19,000 arrests, not incidents, and according to the report as well, 321 of the people who were arrested out of those 19,000 were on a terror watch-list. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730261">The Liberals mismanaged the border with respect to steel and aluminum, allowing Chinese products to come in, resulting in punishing 232 tariffs being slapped on Canadian steel and aluminum, which resulted in economic devastation in those industries. There were jobs lost by hard-working union members. I visited these members at steel plants across the country. They work hard. They lost their jobs because of government incompetence. Now they face the same reality because of how incompetently the Liberal government has mismanaged its relationship with our largest trading partner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730262">When we try to think about the effects of this, we have to think about the workers who are going to be affected. There is 93% of our auto manufacturing that goes to the United States, and 84% of our steel goes to the United States. When we look at unionized workers in the auto sector, the mining sector, forestry and oil and gas, 412,000 union jobs are at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730263">I do not know what the Liberals' approach is, other than incompetence, but we need a new approach. We need a Canada first approach. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730266"> Madam Speaker, we voted against the Ukraine free trade agreement because they tried to impose a carbon tax in a trade agreement for the first time ever. I read every trade agreement we have. Carbon pricing and carbon leakage are not in a single one of them. They were trying to put a carbon tax in a trade agreement with a country at war. It was a terrible thing to do; that is why I voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730267">On the renegotiation, I have read the book by the United States lead negotiator. The member should read it. In it, with respect to their great negotiating tactics, he states that, on August 27, they had an arrangement with only a few hours to spare. However, the entire Canadian delegation was absent because of the cold U.S.-Canada relationships that went from June until August 22, when a new United States-Mexico trade agreement was signed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730268"> Canada was not at the table for three months of those negotiations because of the absolute and utter incompetence of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and government.

I thought maybe a good way to start it off would be to talk about the per capita foreign investment that we witnessed in 2023, where we saw that Canada, on a per capita basis, was number one out of all the G7 countries. In fact, if we take a look at all the countries around the world, we actually placed number three. That is important because it speaks volumes about where investors are looking to invest, and Canada is a prime destination for foreign international investment. One of the reasons for that is that they see in Canada an environment that values trade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730276">As I indicated earlier, no government in the history of our nation has signed off on more trade agreements with other countries than this government has. We understand the true value of international trade. And as the weeks and months go on, what we will be seeing is a great deal more discussion about trade between Canada and the United States because of the re-election of Donald Trump to the office of president. That will take effect, as members are very much aware, in January 2025.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8730284"> These are the types of things that generate real, tangible jobs. Manitoba's pork industry is an industry I have talked a great deal about in the past because it is a great example. There are literally thousands of direct jobs for people, from hog farms to processing plants, whether it is HyLife in Neepawa, Maple Leaf in Brandon or in Winnipeg, or others. There are thousands of direct jobs, not to mention thousands of indirect jobs. There were eight million hogs last year. This industry contributes a great deal to the province. What we apply to Manitoba can be applied to every province. Exports matter and they make a difference. They contribute to Canada's middle class in a real and tangible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8730285"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a commitment to Canadians back in 2015 to work hard in developing, supporting and increasing Canada's middle class. We did that in a number of different ways, including building a healthier infrastructure by spending record amounts of money, investing in Canadians and ultimately signing off on these trade agreements. We took a trade deficit situation from Stephen Harper and turned it into, on the positive side, a trade surplus. We looked at ways to enhance trading opportunities, which helps build that healthier middle class.</ParaText>

Earlier this year, I was with the <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> in Manila, Philippines, where we opened up a trade office. One of the events I attended was at a local grocery store in Manila that had a profile of the many Canadian products on the shelves for sale. It was an impressive number of products. The manager said that Canadian products were in high demand. However, there is so much more potential. We also talked about other aspects of our agricultural industries at the trade office.</ParaText>
