            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278406" Type="2">Ms. Kristina Michaud (Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8716314">Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the question of privilege raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> on November 7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716315">I, too, attended the November 5 meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security at which Lauren Chen was called to testify. I have to say that, like all my colleagues from all parties, I was rather shocked and appalled to see Ms. Chen systematically refuse to answer members' questions, despite the fact that she was unanimously and formally ordered to do so. The committee was asking the witness about what I believe is an extremely serious and important issue regarding Russian interference and the disinformation campaign in Canada. Lauren Chen was named in an indictment against two employees of the Russian public broadcaster in the judicial district of New York, in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716316">I will provide some context. Ms. Chen and her husband, Liam Donovan, own Roaming Millennial Inc., based in Pointe-Claire, Quebec. This business is cited in a 32-page indictment brought a few weeks ago, in September, by the U.S. Attorney General against two Russian employees of the RT television network. These employees are charged with making illegal payments of $10 million to businesses owned by Quebec YouTuber Chen and her husband through a complex network of shell companies. The money went to hire very popular right-wing influencers to disseminate content and messaging reflecting the secret intentions of the Russian government to an American audience, according to the U.S. Justice Department. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716317">Ms. Chen was summoned to appear before a committee. It took several invitations before she finally agreed to come testify. Accompanied by her lawyer, she came on November 5 and read a statement that she had sent us previously. Afterwards, she declined to answer any of the questions put to her by the committee. Ms. Chen was so obstinate in her systematic refusal to answer that she even refused to answer a very simple question that I asked. I asked her for her first and last name. She refused to answer. I asked her for her nationality. Here again she refused to answer. Understandably, the committee members found this somewhat frustrating. We were fully prepared to ask her serious questions about her involvement in Russian disinformation campaigns in Canada, but she refused to answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716318">If we recall the House of Commons' tradition and procedural rules associated with parliamentary privilege, persons testifying before a committee enjoy the same protection as members, which is to say free speech so that they can express themselves freely without fear that their words might be used against them in another proceeding. This immunity derives from section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and section 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act. The courts confirmed that this immunity must extend to persons appearing before the House or one of its committees, the aim being to encourage people to communicate all information they possess in a frank and transparent manner. Otherwise, it is clear that Parliament would be unable to carry out its work effectively and unimpeded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716319">Thus protected, the people who testify before a parliamentary committee must answer the questions asked, save for one exception. A witness may derogate from this rule by raising an objection concerning a question asked by a member of the committee. However, if the committee finds that the question requires a response, the witness must comply and answer, failing which they may be reported to the House. If the committee reports the witness to the House, they may be accused of breach of parliamentary privilege or contempt of parliament. This is what the House decided in the case of Kristian Firth, who refused to answer questions put to him by the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, and whose answers to some questions appeared to the committee to be lies. Here we are referring to the order adopted unanimously by the House of Commons on April 8.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716320">In the Bloc Québécois's opinion, today's matter is akin to a breach of privilege or, at the very least, contempt of Parliament, since Lauren Chen refused to answer any of the committee's questions, although she was fully aware of House procedure and practice. She herself mentioned House practices in her opening speech. Thus, the Bloc Québécois believes it is important that the House seriously discuss the matter so that this type of scenario, which unfortunately appears to be increasing in frequency, does not happen again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716321"> However, the Bloc Québécois finds that the reason provided by Ms. Chen to justify her systematic refusal to answer might require an analysis of whether the immunity relating to freedom of speech extended to Canadian defendants applies before a body having jurisdiction in another country, in this case the United States, considering that Ms. Chen is currently being investigated in a criminal matter in that country following allegations. I am referring to United States v. Kalashnikov et al., 24CR519, (S.D.N.Y. 2024). </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716322">Ms. Chen also mentioned that in her preliminary statement. She frequently referred to the possibility of invoking the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution, as is done in that country to avoid answering questions. We know that that does not apply here in Canada. What we can glean from her testimony, or at least from the little she provided as testimony, is that she was afraid that what she said before a House of Commons of Canada committee could be held against her in the United States. In that case, I think it is important to take that into account. We believe that the case should be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278424" Type="2">Ms. Raquel Dancho (Kildonan—St. Paul, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8716325">Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my comments to the question of privilege raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> on November 7 concerning the 14th report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, of which I am vice-chair. I echo many of the comments made by the member of Bloc Québécois, who is also a vice-chair of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716326">Conservatives are very concerned with the display we saw at the public safety committee on November 5 by Ms. Lauren Chen. The committee is studying the impact of Russian disinformation in Canada. All committees have heard testimony, in this study and others, that Russian interference in Canada is a very serious matter. Russia is looking to sow division and discord in Canada, and it ultimately wants Canada to fail and be weak. What is happening in the western world because of Russia is a very serious matter, and we have been studying that as a priority at the public safety committee over the last few weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716327">I found what happened on November 5 to be quite appalling and an affront to our ability to use accountability tools to hold ministers and others accountable. They are a check on power that we have as official opposition members and members of committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716328">Ms. Chen was first invited to willingly come to committee to answer quite serious allegations. There is a United States Department of Justice indictment that involves her company, Tenet Media. The allegations are that her company received $10 million from covert agents from Russia Today for the purpose of spreading Russian propaganda through her platform. It is quite a serious matter and an issue that is at the heart of what we are discussing at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716329">We invited Ms. Chen to committee, and her testimony was welcome by all parties, but she refused to come willingly. Some of the allegations against her company and against her and the covert actions she allegedly engaged in are quite shocking. She invited other influencers to speak and, as the allegations go, failed to inform them where the funding came from and of the influence that Russia Today had on her platform. All of these individuals were sharing their message under Tenet Media, which was being influenced by Russia, according to the allegations. This is a very serious matter that is topical to our study at committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716330">Ms. Chen was invited but refused, so the committee unanimously agreed to summon her. When she came, and I have never been witness to this but I know it has happened at other committees, she refused to answer any questions. As the Bloc member pointed out, she asked Ms. Chen her name and she would not even answer that question, let alone important questions we had about the influence of Russia Today, which is the propaganda arm of Russia that is looking to undermine and weaken Canada, and the involvement she had in playing along with it and receiving millions of dollars to do that. These were very important questions that are of primary importance to the health of our democracy and our ability to hold wrongdoers accountable. She refused to answer them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716331">The NDP member and the Bloc member outlined, and I agree with their assessment, various regulations in <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, 2017, on pages 1078 to 1079, which states: “Witnesses must answer all questions which the committee puts to them.” We agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716332">I know, Mr. Speaker, that you know procedure better than anyone, other than perhaps the experts sitting at the table in front of you, whom we all rely on, but beyond that, when you are considering this question of privilege, I would ask you to consider the impact your ruling will have. Do we want to allow, as parliamentarians and committee members, a precedent to be set, which I would argue is very dangerous, for the accountability mechanisms we have as parliamentarians? If this is allowed to go ahead and Ms. Chen is not called to the bar or is not held accountable for her lack of responses, what does that say to all other witnesses? What does that say to ministers of any political stripe? What does that say to anyone invited to committee who is a bit uncomfortable or, for whatever reason, does not want to answer questions? What does that really say?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716333">Your ruling will set down that either Parliament believes it is unacceptable and people must come to committee to answer questions or they do not have to if they do not feel like it. I would ask for you to consider what precedent this will set moving forward, because I think it will be quite impactful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716334"> If Ms. Chen gets away with her bad behaviour without a clear reprimand, it will be deeply impactful and concerning for Parliament and for the ability of committees to hold wrongdoers accountable. Again, she has not been convicted of anything. She has not actually been formally charged. What we are saying, and what we are concerned with at committee, is that she took money from Russia to further their propaganda, which aims to undermine Canada and other western actors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716335">What she was there to talk about is very serious, and we need those answers from her. Regardless of that, if she is allowed to get away without a reprimand from Parliament, as we have seen with Kristian Firth and others, that is a very dangerous precedent to set for accountability. We would be saying, as Parliament, that it is okay if someone comes to committee and does not answer any of our questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716336">The committee does incredibly important work. All the committees are seized with critical issues right now. If we have witnesses who come and do not have to answer, what are we all doing this for? What is our duty as parliamentarians at committee? What is our duty as opposition members if people can just show up and say nothing? In our rule books, we have as precedent for hundreds of years that people have to come and answer questions; she did not do that. In fact, I found that it was quite insulting to the institution at large, to parliamentarians at the table who have been duly elected by the Canadian public to fulfill their duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716337">We have been appointed to committee. Our duty is to hold people accountable, to gather expert testimony, to finalize reports, to issue recommendations to Parliament, to ensure that Canada and Canadians are well aware of what is going on in these critical issues they are concerned about. Russian disinformation deeply impacts us all, just as interference from China, India, Iran and Pakistan does. This is not a nothing issue. This is a critical issue that has an impact on modern democracies and the foundations and the security of our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716338">I would ask you to consider, Mr. Speaker, the precedent that your ruling will set. Whatever it is, it will be of paramount importance. Given that all parties support this and have supported it every step of the way, in fact, this is not a partisan issue. This has nothing to do with somebody's political leanings or even with the issue itself, although it is serious, as I have outlined. The question is this: Can people come to committee and disrespect Parliament by saying nothing? I would say no, and I hope that you agree, Mr. Speaker, after you review this and rule on this question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716339">Conservatives have supported this. We have been in lockstep with other parties on this. It speaks volumes that we are united on something for once. It is a very serious matter, Mr. Speaker, and I ask that you use the tools at your disposal and at Parliament's disposal to ensure that anyone who is doing this is held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716340">To conclude on the specific matter Ms. Chen was called to committee about, as a patriotic Canadian and somebody who loves this country and is honoured to serve it in this capacity, I was quite appalled to read that indictment and to think that a fellow Canadian is taking money from a foreign government to undermine the Canadian interest. I was appalled as a parliamentarian to sit across from someone who refused to answer for her own actions, who did not have the integrity to answer for what she had allegedly done. There is a lot in here that sets quite a precedent. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to consider those things holistically and, at the end of the day, consider whether our privilege as parliamentarians has been violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716341">When someone is invited to a committee by all members and summoned to answer questions on something of this magnitude of importance, and even if it is any other issue, do we not have the privilege to hear answers to those questions? Is that not a centuries-old tradition? If someone is allowed not to answer, what does that say about the strength of our democracy, the committee process or our ability as duly elected parliamentarians to hold people accountable? It calls into question all of those powers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716342">This is a much bigger question of our democratic institutions, Mr. Speaker, and I ask that you consider that holistically and really think about the seriousness of the decision you make and the precedent it will set. Ultimately, the Conservatives believe that committees and the powers we have should be used to hold wrongdoers accountable. It is tough to say this in the House because it is a very serious allegation, but someone who may very well be a traitor to this country needs to be held accountable for not coming to committee and answering questions on those allegations. I would ask you to consider that as a patriotic Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716343">The Conservatives want to see people held accountable. They want to see our powers maintained. They want to see respect for this place maintained. This happens with decisions you are about to make.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716362">Mr. Speaker, I move that the 21st report of the Standing Committee on International Trade, presented on Wednesday, October 30, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716363">The number of shipments seized at Canadian customs, all regions combined, for use of forced labour is zero. That does not include the one shipment that was seized in 2021 and then released following an appeal by the importer. In comparison, Washington seizes billions of dollars' worth of goods, and all from a single region, Xinjiang.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716364">Canada is absolutely lax. In March 2023, Ottawa released its budget. It announced the government's intention to “introduce legislation by 2024 to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains to strengthen the import ban on goods produced using forced labour.” This is written in black and white on page 171 of the English version and page 192 of the French version. Until proven otherwise, we are in 2024. No bill was introduced before the end of 2023. This is another promise broken and a promise immediately rehashed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716365">In March 2024, in its new budget, Ottawa indicates yet again its intention “to introduce legislation in 2024 to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains and to strengthen the import ban on goods produced with forced labour.” Again, it is written in black and white. No need to believe me, anyone can read it on page 369 of the French version and page 320 of the English version.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716366">I had this motion adopted in committee to ensure that members could call out this broken promise and find it unacceptable and to stress that time is of the essence. The motion was not supported by the parties, it was adopted by the majority in committee. The Conservatives voted in favour of the motion and so did the NDP. Now, we are moving the motion in the House because there is a month left. The House must clearly state that it considers this inaction to be deplorable and that the use of practices that violate the fundamental rights of workers, vulnerable people and children is totally unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716367">I remind you once again that, in March 2023, they said the same thing, that they would present something before the end of the year. I proposed a motion before the Standing Committee on International Trade suggesting that we write a letter to the government to remind it of its commitment to introduce a bill before 2023 and demand an explanation for its inaction. This motion was unanimously adopted, but it was never acted on. The government did not deign to reply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716368">This same government then shamelessly did a cut-and-paste in its next budget, as if it were business as usual, simply changing “end of 2023” to “end of 2024”. It simply changed the deadline before which it would not even think of lifting a finger. We have had it. Parliament must stand up and clearly state, by adopting our motion, that this will not work this time. Consumers do not want blood on their hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716369">I will make a few comparisons. United States Customs and Border Protection has the power to refuse waivers for goods it reasonably believes were manufactured through forced labour. These refusals can target a company, a region or a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716370">What follows is important. The onus is on the importers to convince United States Customers and Border Protection that the goods were not made through forced labour. In addition, in December 2021, the United States passed a law preventing forced labour by Uyghurs, which creates a rebuttable presumption that all imported goods, products, items and merchandise grown, mined, produced or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, or by companies that appear on a list prepared by the U.S. government are manufactured through the use of forced labour and are denied entry into the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716371">They take for granted that everything that comes from the list or the region comes from forced labour. The importer bears the burden of proof, because the United States' rebuttable presumption also applies to goods manufactured in or shipped to China and other countries that include materials or inputs manufactured in Xinjiang or that transit that country. The burden of proof is therefore on the importer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716372">In Canada, we just have the customs tariff as the legislative framework that allows customs officials not to consider goods as banned, but rather to determine the tariff classification of the imported goods. This is done on a case-by-case basis, based on the likelihood that forced labour was used according to the information available at the time of importation. Therefore, giving the Canada Border Services Agency the responsibility of screening goods amounts to assuming that the use of forced labour to produce those goods can be determined by a flashlight inspection of the cargo. That is really what that means. The brilliant result of this approach is that nothing has ever been seized at the Canadian border. The federal government allows companies to act with virtual impunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716373"> This applies not just to imports, but, if we consider a broader spectrum and perspective, it also applies to behaviours, accountability and due diligence of Canadian firms abroad. In 2023, the House of Commons passed, by a majority, Bill<Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>. At the time, Ottawa framed this as a bold move, but at the end of the day it has proven to be toothless. The only thing the bill did was introduce a reporting requirement but only for businesses with 250 or more employees with significant active income. They are only required to prepare a small annual report on the measures taken on forced labour and child labour. That is the only matter covered here. Some will say that a business that refuses to produce this report could be fined, and that is certainly true, but there is nothing stopping a business from putting out a report stating that it did not take any measures. It can simply send that off and it has met its requirement, full stop. It can do the same thing the following year too. That is the extent of it. I would argue that this law is as useless as the Senate that created and introduced it. Producing a report, even one stating that nothing was done, does not exactly amount to a due diligence law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716374">What we have here is a typically Canadian attitude, reflecting the same culture of symbolism. Ottawa would have been completely free to sit on its purported laurels, had there been any laurels to sit on. That is why I voted against this empty shell of a bill at the time, along with my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716375"> Instead, I am co-sponsoring Bill <Document DbId="11611332" Type="4">C-262</Document>, which comes from the NDP. We have always said that when the idea is good, we will have no problem supporting it, and so I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill, which covers all human rights and businesses of all sizes. It seeks to involve the affected communities and, above all, it provides recourse to the victims. That is what an actual due diligence law to address the matter would look like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716376">Ottawa may not carefully screen goods entering the country through its approach, which makes customs officers responsible for seizures and removes the onus of proof from importers, but, as I have just shown, it is no more serious about the behaviours of Canadian firms abroad. This is also evident in the trade agreements submitted to us. Lofty principles are bandied about, but without any obligations attached. Ideas and international conventions are referenced, but there are no obligations or genuine accountability. For example, in the case of the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement, the only amendment received in committee was mine. It stated that this chapter was fine and good, but the Minister of International Trade should have to report annually to the House on what is going on over there in terms of human rights and corporate behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716377">The same applies to this office called the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise. Basically, it is a complaints bureau, a pretty apathetic response to some truly scandalous behaviour. Its mandate is to “review a complaint that is submitted by a Canadian company that believes it is the subject of an unfounded human rights abuse allegation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716378">When the position was created in 2018, the Canadian government pledged that this officer would have the investigative powers to require businesses to produce documents and to compel them to testify. Both of these powers strike me as important in the case of an inquiry. I would even say that they are fundamental. As I stand here today, these powers have yet to be assigned.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716379">In fact, the Mining Association of Canada is opposed to this and declared it in a public statement. We take comfort in the fact that the ombudsperson has a lovely website, but we would prefer the office to have the capacity to require entities to produce documents and compel their testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716380">In 2009, a Bloc bill seeking the creation of an extraterritorial activities review commission for Canadian businesses died on the Order Paper. This politically independent commission would not have simply received complaints but would have been able to launch its own inquiries. Even without a complaint, it could have launched its own inquiries and publicly called on the Department of Foreign Affairs to withdraw its support of offending mining corporations. This would have represented a truly effective mechanism. Unsurprisingly, Parliament did not go along with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716381">I myself attempted, in my capacity as member, to file a motion seeking the unanimous consent of the House of Commons to establish a genuine institution to monitor the behaviours of Canadian businesses abroad. Needless to say, the motion did not receive unanimous consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716382">If I bring up the mining companies, it is because I find them particularly interesting. Even though Canada can be characterized as an imperialistic, colonial and world-dominating country, it is still a sieve, a haven for foreign interests. Today, roughly three-quarters of the world's mining companies are Canadian, and the vast majority of them are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, meaning they can speculate on the value of mines. Canada is just a flag of convenience for companies, who need only open a post office box to be considered Canadian. A number of these mining companies are Canadian in name only. To take advantage of Ottawa's lax legislation, any investor can found their company with Canadian joint shareholders, but can conduct mining operations in a developing country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716383">A number of businesses with questionable behaviours receive financial support from Export Development Canada, whose accountability mechanisms are very limited. Its representatives were questioned in committee. Let us say that they do not exactly dig deep to learn where the money is going. There is also diplomatic support on the part of Canadian embassies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716384">In a report published in 2022, the Justice and Corporate Accountability Project mentions, for example, serious acts of violence at the Marlin mine in Guatemala. This mine was acquired in 2006 by Goldcorp, a Canadian mining company. There were credible allegations of environmental contamination and harm to human health. According to the report, the activities of certain Canadian public servants in 2010 and 2011 seeking to defend the interests of Goldcorp undermined the efforts of communities, mostly Mayan indigenous communities, to access the inter-American human rights system and its support to defend their rights. Canada is therefore providing both diplomatic and financial support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716385">While Canada is currently negotiating a free trade deal with Ecuador, we might ask why the Canadian ambassador there has refused to meet with the country's indigenous businesses but immediately agreed to meet with mining representatives. He did not have a problem with that. That same ambassador, who did not seem to appreciate my questions when he came to testify before the Standing Committee on International Trade, frequently rolling his eyes, even rejected the concerns of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights about the troubling unrest in two regions where police repression was especially abusive, particularly to ensure the imposition of Canadian mining investments suspected of having an impact on water contamination and social division.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716386">There is another case, which made the news a few weeks ago, concerning the behaviour of Barrick Gold, another Canadian mining company, in Tanzania. We keep seeing examples of this. It is a serious issue. We hear about the eviction of villagers and other outrageous incidents. In November 2022, legal action was brought against Barrick Gold in Ontario following allegations of brutal murders, shootings and torture committed by police officers responsible for watching the mine. This is the seventh case of human rights violations filed by foreign plaintiffs against a Canadian mining company since 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716387">Since 1997, nine complaints have been filed in Canadian courts against mining companies following allegations surrounding their activities abroad. These cases involve assault, shootings, gang rapes of local indigenous women by the mine's security officers, the use of slaves, and the contamination of a river with mining waste.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716388">During human rights missions to Chile in 2020 and Colombia in 2021, I was able to hear first-hand accounts from affected communities detailing water pollution, air contamination, security militias firing on civilians at point-blank range and evictions of local residents. In Colombia, I personally witnessed a mining company's private security detail directing traffic on a public road. Is this normal? In 2016, a report entitled “The ‘Canada Brand’” found that violence associated with Canadian mining companies in Latin America had led to 44 deaths, 30 of which were classified as targeted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716389">There is no shortage of terrifying stories. I do not have enough time to go through them all, but there are definitely a lot of them. Another report, released in 2009, noted that “Canadian companies have been the most significant group involved in unfortunate incidents in the developing world” and that “Canadian companies are more likely to be engaged in community conflict [and] environmental and unethical behaviour”. The Canadian Centre for the Study of Resource Conflict reported that Canada held the record for the most violations among developed countries operating mines in developing countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716390">A 2016 report by York University researchers documented incidents from 2000 to 2015 that were corroborated by at least two independent sources. It found 44 deaths, 403 injuries and 709 cases of criminalization. There was a widespread geographical distribution of violence, since deaths occurred in 11 countries, injuries were suffered in 13 countries, and criminalization occurred in 12 countries. Interestingly, the report notes that Canadian companies that are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange do not include reports of violence in their mandatory reports on company performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716391">The fight against human rights violations committed for the sake of profit will require a whole spectrum of solutions. I have some ideas I would like to share, even though I know that not everyone in the House will agree with them: requiring importers to prove that their goods were not produced with forced labour; passing real due diligence legislation, like Bill <Document DbId="11611332" Type="4">C-262</Document>, to crack down harder on Canadian firms operating abroad; offering victims genuine recourse; giving the ombudsperson more powers, in the absence of a real, politically independent commission capable of launching its own investigations, which we think would have been the ideal solution; ending Ottawa's diplomatic policy of complicity; and taking a closer look at where Export Development Canada's money is going in other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716392">These are ideas. Not everyone in the House would agree with them. I have talked to the other parties about this. We will not all agree on what we would like to see in a future bill. However, we can agree that we cannot judge what we have not seen and that, at this point in time, we should have seen it a year ago. I therefore call on the entire House to clearly and strongly remind the government of its promise, which it has yet to fulfill, to table a bill by the end of the year. Consumers do not want blood on their hands.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716398"> Mr. Speaker, the report on forced labour uses very strong language to denounce the government's failures. It describes the government's failures to take seriously the issue of forced labour as deplorable.</ParaText>

We have a Liberal member voting in favour of a motion that calls her own government's performance on the issue of forced labour absolutely deplorable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716400"> However, it is no wonder Liberal members find the actions of their own government deplorable on this file as it relates to Uyghur forced labour in particular, about which the member spoke. The Americans have been so far ahead, stopping many shipments of goods over concerns about forced labour from the Uyghur regions, but Canada has not stopped a single shipment. I believe this puts us in breach of our obligations under CUSMA to have all partners to that agreement act to combat forced labour. Therefore, this is going to be a challenge not only to us morally, but also in Canada-U.S. relations in that we are not doing our part.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716402">Mr. Speaker, I need to start by clarifying something for my colleague. The Liberal chair did not vote in favour of the motion. She was absent that day. His Conservative colleague, the committee's vice-chair, was presiding that day. The vote came down to a tie, and it was his colleague who voted in favour of the motion. I thank him for that.

My colleague is right to note that it is not just a moral issue. Of course, there are many human rights organizations, and the practices we are talking about are totally immoral at every level. However, there is also a geopolitical and economic aspect. There is the matter of the confidence that our neighbours to the south have in us. Everyone keeps saying that there is going to be a lot of upheaval soon. There is a lot of uncertainty. I think we need to start proving to the United States that we do not just import Chinese goods no questions asked.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716408"> The federal government is now negotiating with Ecuador, and it is clear that it wants to put in investor-state dispute mechanisms to protect Canadian mining companies in their fight against indigenous people, against minorities and people living on the land in Ecuador. This goes against the real sense of what Canada should be doing in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716410">We support Bill <Document DbId="11611332" Type="4">C‑262</Document>. I am a supporter and co-sponsor of the bill, and I thank the NDP for bringing it forward. We support this legislation and, as co-sponsor, I fully and freely endorse it. It is a perfect example of genuine due diligence legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716411">The Conservatives and the Liberals voted for Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S‑211</Document>. As I said at the end of my speech, we are unlikely to see eye to eye on what elements should be included in legislation on importing goods produced using forced labour or on eliminating forced labour from supply chains. I respect that. That is democracy. We will have a chance to debate the issue in due course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716412">Today, we need to refocus the debate around a simple reminder. The House has to send a clear message to the government that it broke its promise and that it has to bring us something. We keep hearing that governing is all about planning. The government needs to bring us a bill so that we can debate it. Our opinions will probably differ, but we should at least remind it that the promise it made has not been kept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716413">Regarding Ecuador, my colleague was there, too. A lot of promises were made and a lot of things were said. As I said in my speech, when the Canadian ambassador appeared before the committee, he could not explain or justify the violence there. He could not explain why he went to meet with mining companies, but not with indigenous communities. This situation does need to be monitored very closely. I even had some women from Ecuador come and speak at a press conference a few weeks ago, and they urged us to pay closer attention to what is happening there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716418">Setting aside the moral and common sense aspects, this country is allergic to the concept of having a strategy, to the idea of using levers and having a government that can provide policy direction regarding forced labour, foreign investments and many other issues. All of that is interrelated. Washington must think we are complete bozos. Actually, I should not have said “we”, because “we” includes the person who is speaking, and I do not consider myself a Canadian. Anyway, Canada is seen as a weak country and a laggard in all of these areas when it comes to policy. The issue that we are talking about is a matter of North American geopolitical security.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8716419">Mr. Speaker, forced labour is not something new; it has been around for many years. When I listen to the questions and answers, it is a bit much to hear a Conservative talk about forced labour, when Stephen Harper and the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> did absolutely nothing to deal with it. I will be fair: When Senate Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document> was before us, the Conservatives joined us in passing it. At the very least, Conservatives have done some positive things in working with the government and recognizing the issue of forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716420">It is interesting that we are now having the debate on the issue primarily because of what I have often referred to as a multi-million dollar game the Conservatives are playing. As opposed to other opposition parties participating directly in the filibuster game, they are bringing forward motions for concurrence. I can appreciate the frustration other opposition parties are feeling because day after day for weeks now, the Conservative Party has filibustered, putting the self-interest of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party in general ahead of the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716421">The filibustering prevents us debating things such as the legislative agenda that would assist Canadians in many different ways, whether it is protecting children against the Internet, transferring military court to civilian court on issues of sexual violence, Canadian citizenship or the fall economic statement. These are just part of the government agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716422">There is also Private Members' Business and there are opposition day motions. I suggest the current debate would have been a great debate for an opposition day motion. I truly believe that, because at the end of the day, forced labour, as I said, is nothing new, even though Stephen Harper and the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> ignored it 100% during their tenure. It would have been a great discussion to have, and in the end it would have been great to have a positive resolution to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716423">We have raised the issue in budgets, as has been pointed out. The motion itself went before the standing committee, and I compliment the efforts of the standing committee with respect to the people it listened to and its coming up with a report, but I would remind members that we have made a commitment to bring forward government legislation that would look at improving Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716424">Of course we have to look at why we are having a difficult time getting legislation through the House of Commons, but that is not the fault of the Government of Canada or even the Bloc or the New Democrats. That responsibility falls on the shoulders of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. We will continue to look at ways to bring in the legislation that we have committed to.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716425"> Hopefully there will be the same sense of enthusiasm as with the first Conservative question when we bring in legislation, and there will be a warmth to the idea to allow debate to occur and possibly even to allow legislation to go to committee and ultimately pass through third reading and be given royal assent. What a wonderful idea that would be, but somehow we have to dislodge the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>'s belief that Parliament is here to serve him and him alone. We need to understand that Parliament is here to serve Canadians first and foremost, and then we will be able to ultimately do more for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716426">On the issue of forced labour, one does not need to expand on the literally millions of individuals around the world who are affected. In virtually every country, there is forced labour being put into place. We need to recognize, as we have as a government, that the government can play a significant role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716427">There are some people who have absolutely no time for the Senate. I for one see great value in the Senate, and Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document> is a good example of that. When the Senate of Canada passed that legislation through its system, it came to the House of Commons. First reading of the bill took place on May 3, 2022, and second reading was then completed on June 1, 2022. It then went to committee in November 2022. Report stage was completed on March 6, 2023, and third reading was completed on May 3, 2023. Royal assent was given shortly thereafter, and the legislation took effect in January of this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716428">That is the type of thing that can take place, not only on Senate legislation but also on government legislation. Now that there is a <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> who puts his interests first and foremost, the primary difference is that legislation is being put on hold more and more often. This is a direct result of his self-interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716429">There are many pieces of legislation before the House and many that are going to be introduced to the House that deserve the merit not only of debate but also of going through the process and ultimately becoming law. I would suggest that Canada is a better society as a direct result of Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>. Think of the results there have been with Bill S-211. Before the legislation passed through the House with the support of the Liberals and the Conservatives, there was nothing really in place to report forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716430">As a direct result of the bill's getting royal assent and January being the date the legislation came into effect, there have been literally thousands and thousands of businesses or companies that have had to report in on the issue of forced labour in the supply chains. We have now identified that a very high percentage of those that have reported in are raising concerns in regard to forced labour in the supply chain. For the first time, the government actually has a much better sense of the degree to which forced labour is being used here in the Canadian supply chain.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716431">The issue of forced labour is something the government takes seriously. When we were having the trade negotiations with the United States, on the one hand the Conservatives were crying and wanting to capitulate and say, “It does not matter; just get an agreement.” That was the Conservative approach to the Donald Trump first trade discussions that were taking place: Capitulate, do whatever it is that the United States wants and just get an agreement signed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716432">We worked very hard on CUSMA. Canada has, I would argue, the very best individual abilities in the world in terms of negotiating trade agreements, and I do not say that lightly. No government in the history of Canada has signed off on more trade agreements than the current government has. We do that because we recognize the true value of trade for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716433">If we want to strengthen Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it, we have to focus attention on trade. Through that, working with Canadians and working with the different partners, record numbers of new jobs having been created, virtually double the number of jobs that Stephen Harper created in his nine years of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716434">With respect to how the issue has been evolving, we can look at the CUSMA deal and see that within it, we negotiated to prohibit importing goods made by forced labour. Does that mean it is a perfect deal? No one is saying that; there is always room for improvement. When we sit down with President-elect Trump in the future, members can know that we will have Canadian interests in our minds and heart. Unlike the Conservatives, who will advocate to capitulate based on their previous negotiations, we will ensure that the deal is in the best interests of Canadians. We have the record to clearly demonstrate this as a government that has signed off on far more trade agreements not only than Stephen Harper but also more than in the history of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716435"> People understand and know how important trade is between Canada and the United States. When we talk about jobs, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of good-quality Canadian jobs that are dependent on successful negotiations, and Canadians need to be aware that it is the current government and <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that got and signed off on the trade agreement known as CUSMA with the United States. It was the Conservatives who wanted us to capitulate and give the Americans whatever they wanted. It is because of our experience in dealing with trade agreements that we were able to achieve what we received. Within that, we talked about labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716436"> Interestingly, the House will remember one of the most recent trade agreements that we signed off on was the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement update. We will remember that, because the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> actually voted against it and instructed his minions to follow suit and vote against it. I withdraw the word “minions” just in case some people are a little offended by it. The Conservatives voted against a trade agreement. What is really interesting is that the very first trade agreement that the Conservatives, from what I can recall, ever voted against was the Canada-Ukraine trade agreement update.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716437">We were talking earlier about a question of privilege about the influence that Russia is having. There is a story about how Russian influencers are trying to say all these bad things about our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in an attempt to prop up the Conservative Party of Canada. There is an interesting connection there, and we will have to wait and see.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716438"> I would love to see this issue go to the standing committee. I would love the opportunity to see to what degree we would have interference affecting the Conservative Party going into the next election. However, I digress somewhat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716439">I believe that when we look at where we go from here, whether it is with respect to budgetary measures, legislative measures or dealing with the issue of forced labour, we continue to move forward. That is why the minister has provided assurances, as instructed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the form of mandate letters, that we will put into place legislation that will enhance and protect the interests of Canadians. We know the values we have say that we have to look at our supply chains and deal with the forced labour issue. That is something the Government of Canada is prepared to do in a very real and tangible way. That is why we have maintained the commitment that we will, in fact, be bringing in legislation to that effect before the end of the year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716440">I have three minutes to go. That is not enough time. At the end of the day, we could talk about trade, supply lines and related issues like forced labour, for many hours. As a government, more so than the Conservative government ever did, we understand how, by looking at trade and international trade, we can build a stronger and healthier middle class while at the same time dealing with the social issues that Canadians are concerned about. With respect to issues such as forced labour, in particular in areas like mining and manufacturing, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has clearly shown, we can do both. The numbers show that, through the policies we have put into place that were driven by budgetary and legislative measures, we have built a healthier middle class, especially in these economic times, which can be a challenge for many of the constituents we represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716441">The nice thing is that things are getting better. Interest rates are going down. Affordability is so much better. The inflation rate is below 2%. We are doing, in comparison with other countries, exceptionally well. However, that does not mean that we cannot do better. That is why we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, a government and members of the Liberal caucus who continue to persist every day in improving conditions for Canadians.

There has been a very significant, positive impact from that legislation already to date, and we have seen thousands and thousands of companies that have now reported. We know there is a very high percentage of areas where there is forced labour that needs to be factored in and we believe we will have better legislation introduced before the end of the year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716462">I would remind members of the New Democratic Party that before this administration, absolutely nothing was being done on the issue and it has been a very busy legislative agenda. For the last number of weeks, all we have seen is a great deal of filibustering, preventing legislation from passing any stage by the Conservative Party. We look to our friends within the NDP, who have worked with us in the past, to try to get legislation through. Hopefully, we will get the bill the minister is talking to a first reading, and even get it beyond that. In order to do that, we need to have a partner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716463">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting because the member does speak to the government's intentions of advancing legislation. I know constituents within the riding of Waterloo sent me to this place to have tough conversations to actually get work done on their behalf. They cannot be here, so I try to have conversations with a diversity of perspectives. When it comes to legislation on forced labour, they know the government has intentions to advance it, yet they recognize the Conservatives have paralyzed the House. They brought it to a standstill. They refuse to have work done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716464">Today, we started the House on points of order and just comments in regards to witnesses at committee and not having the best interest of Canadians at hand. What is clear is that the Conservatives have gone to former prime minister Stephen Harper's way and they will fight for Conservatives, but they will not fight for Canadians. That is one of the reasons I put my name on a ballot. I think the member has articulated very clearly that the Bloc and the NDP suggest they want to get work done, but they do not want to get work done because they know how we can get back onto a legislative agenda. They know they have a role to play, but they refuse to play that role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716465">I would like to ask the member, when it comes to the intentions in the House, when it comes to actually getting work done, how we can get this work done. Today is moved by the Bloc Québécois, which just wants to separate our country. The NDP is more concerned about my attire than it is about policy. What can we do in the House to actually get to the legislative agenda so we can deliver for Canadians, middle-class Canadians and those working hard to join them? Today, this concurrence motion, I agree, is very important. I think the issue is very important, but the government has signalled time and time again that it wants to advance legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716472"> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to start debate, and I am also pleased to announce that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278521" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716473">Canada needs a government that understands how to build an open economy, how to build an economy, how to create jobs and how to create powerful paycheques to ensure that we have economic growth, not only for our nation, but also for our provinces, our regions and our citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716474"> The book <I>Why Nations Fail</I>, which is, by the way, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s favourite book, emphasizes that countries prosper when they foster open economic systems that create opportunities for growth and provide incentives for people to save, innovate and invest. When we look at Canada right now and the challenges Canadians have, we see that they are losing those opportunities and those opportunities are going south.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716475">We can talk about the carbon tax, which is set to increase again on April 1. It punishes our farmers and our businesses. We can talk about a housing crisis, which is the largest in the history of this country, through which we have seen rents double, mortgage payments double, and the amount needed for a down payment double. We talk about debt and a budget. We are already talking about increased deficits coming to the budget, if we ever see one, for 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716476">What does that mean? It has been proven over the last four years that we have increased the debt. We have increased spending from an ever-increasing, growing government. We have high inflation, and high inflation adds cost, the invisible tax, to every Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716477">An open economy is not just about trade. It is about democracy. A strong democracy promotes freedom, transparency and fairness, not only within our borders, but also for those we engage with around the world through our trading agreements. The trade agreements we have in Canada were all set up by the previous government. The European Union trade agreement was set up by Stephen Harper. When we look at the TPP, which became the CPTPP, it was set up by Stephen Harper. The Liberal government, when it came into power, got to sign those agreements, but they were agreements set in stone based on our shared democracy, our shared freedom and those values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716478">Over the last nine years, we have seen those values erode, and we have seen certain parts of our trading relationships result in forced labour. There are forced labour camps that are forcing citizens into camps, into gruelling conditions, and those products are ending up on Canadian shores. When we look at our trade and our democracy, we see that Canada is a steward for freedom. We need to ensure that we have democracy and freedom here at home and in nations abroad. We can use the trading relationships we have with nations to ensure we force the values that we find important. I am going to walk members through a couple of stats on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716479">In China, reports indicate that over three million innocent Uyghurs are currently detained in concentration camps, where they face indoctrination, forced labour and torture in various degrees. Forced labour is the work or service of any person under the threat of penalty for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily. It is estimated that more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of East Turkestan to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716480">I am going to walk members through a day in a labour camp because it is really important for Canadians to understand their stories of survival and resilience. Imagine someone being abruptly taken from their home, their family and their life, accused of crimes they did not commit or simply targeted because of their ethnicity or beliefs. This is the reality for countless individuals detained in forced labour camps across the world, particularly in regions like Xinjiang, China, where Uyghurs and other minorities endure unimaginable hardships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716481">A person arrives at a sprawling facility surrounded by high walls, watchtowers and armed guards. There is no trial and no lawyer. There is just an accusation. Their identity as a Uyghur, a Turkic Muslim, or a member of another minority group is enough to condemn them. Upon arrival, they are stripped of their belongings, including any dignity. Uniforms replace their clothes, and their name is replaced by a number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716482">Each day begins before sunrise with roll calls and chants praising the government. After that, the work begins. For many, this means long hours in poorly ventilated workshops or factories producing textiles, electronics or even solar panels for export. Other people are sent to agricultural fields, where they pick cotton under the scorching sun for 12 to 16 hours a day, with minimal breaks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716483">Conditions are gruelling. There are no safety measures, and injuries are common. A cut from factory machinery or a sprain in the field is not treated. People are expected to work through the pain. Malnutrition is rampant, with meals consisting of watery soup, a piece of bread and occasionally some rice. Hunger gnaws at them constantly, sapping their energy and their spirit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716484">There is punishment. Stepping out, even unintentionally, results in severe punishment. Some are beaten for slowing down or for failing to meet their quotas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716485">Beyond forced labour, detainees are subject to indoctrination, including hours of mandatory classes teaching loyalty to the state and to its leaders, and denouncing religion or cultural practices. Uyghur detainees are often forced to denounce Islam, shave their beards or eat pork as signs of progress, and the end never comes. There is no clear end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716486">For those listening at home, that is the reality of forced labour, and the fact is that Canada, to this point, has not announced or brought to Parliament any legislation to disallow this kind of treatment. That allows these products to end up on Canadian shores.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716487">The products are many. I will list some of the products that we are bringing to Canada. There are textiles, electronics, agricultural products, cotton, artificial sweeteners, Christmas decorations, coal, footwear, garments, gloves, hair products, nails, toys and tomato products. These are the products coming in, and the U.S. Department of Labor has announced other products that it is including, such as steel, aluminum and seafood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716488">Canada is not the nation it needs to be. Our failure to address forced labour in our supply chains is both a moral and an economic failure. The United States has taken decisive action to combat forced labour, and despite clear evidence of forced labour in global supply chains, Canada has done little more than pay lip service. The U.S. has banned products tied to forced labour, especially from China, while Canada allows these goods into our markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716489"> In February 2021, the House of Commons voted 266-0 to recognize China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims as genocide. One would think that was all of Parliament, but no, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet abstained from the vote, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="278307" Type="2">Waterloo</Affiliation>, who was just standing up in the House. They abstained from the vote and said that they did not have enough information. There is enough information to show that this is inhumane treatment and what the toll has been, yet Canada stands talking about being a steward of trade and democracy in the world, but has, so far, not run legislation to outlaw this forced labour being part of trade and included in our supply lines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716490">America took the lead. In 2020, when the U.S. enacted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, blocking imports tied to human rights abuses in China, the legislation set a global standard, showing that trade must align with ethical practices. I will list a couple of instances where this fell through the cracks in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716491">In November 2021, the Canada Border Services Agency intercepted a shipment of women's and children's clothing suspected to have links to forced labour. In January 2021, at least 18 Canadian companies imported PPE from Top Glove, a Malaysian manufacturer banned by the U.S. over forced labour concerns. This brings me to our main point. When it comes to Canada not being aligned with other nations, it is going to affect our trading relationships, and our trading relationship with the Americans is the worst of all at present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716492">This issue and others have misaligned us from the world's largest, and our number one, trading partner. When Stephen Harper was in power, we were the U.S.'s number one trading partner, and now we are the third trading partner for the Americans. Mexico is number one. Canada is number three. That is because of the lack of trade relationships and partnerships that this government has, but most importantly, it is because the Liberals fail to link freedom and democracy with trade and with the growing threat of slave labour in China and other nations. We have to fix that, and a Conservative government would ensure that we do great trade with good nations, that we do it ethically and responsibly, and that we outlaw slave labour from nations such as China.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716508">Of course, the government's role then is to ensure that we have good laws and good trading agreements to ensure that those supply chains are ethical and are the best for Canadians. However, most importantly, it is competition that brings that aspect to Canadian corporations and helps fix this big problem.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8716509">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that is increasingly pressing, not only in terms of human rights, but also for Canada's economic future: forced labour in our supply chains. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716510">This scourge directly affects the goods that enter our market, specifically products from China, a country where forced labour practices are well documented but where efforts to end those practices remain inadequate. This is largely a result of the Liberal government's inaction. This situation is all the more concerning when we consider the economic and morally unacceptable consequences of these practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716511">Beyond the low-price manufactured goods, entire industries are affected by this systemic exploitation of vulnerable workers. The impact is real and goes well beyond simple ethical considerations. It affects our supply chains, our economy and the labour conditions of our own citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716512">Take the electric vehicle battery industry as an example. The essential materials needed to produce these batteries, like polysilicon, largely come from the Xinjiang region of China, which is infamous for its use of forced Uyghur labour. For the most part, the polysilicon used to manufacture solar panels and batteries is produced by workers forced to labour under inhumane conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716513">These minerals and components find their way into our supply chains and are used in industries considered key to Canada's energy future, especially the transition to electric vehicles. Not only are these criminal practices a human rights issue, they also threaten the competitiveness of our businesses. By allowing these products to enter the Canadian market, the government is fostering unfair competition that forces Canadian companies, held to strict environmental standards and decent wage practices, to compete with products produced by exploited workers, obviously at a much lower cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716514">It is vital to remember that China, despite its international commitments, continues to cover up and encourage forced labour practices in its factories. The Uyghurs, a Muslim minority, are persecuted and used for forced labour under conditions akin to modern-day slavery. Millions of these workers are forced to produce goods ranging from clothing and electronics to products used in the construction and renewable energy sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716515">The fact is, behind the cheap products on our shelves lies systematic and intentional exploitation. Our supply chains are contaminated by these unfair practices, and our government's response is inadequate. By allowing these products into our country, we are violating the ethical principles that we claim to uphold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716516">Almost two years ago, in March 2023, the Liberal government committed to legislating against the importation of products made with forced labour, but no law has been passed in the year since. There was even a unanimous motion adopted in November 2023 calling on the government to honour its commitments.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716517">Once again, this government has failed to take any concrete action. Nothing has been done to effectively stop these goods from infiltrating our markets. This inaction is more than just a moral lapse. It is also a strategic error that will weaken our economy in the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716518">Meanwhile, the U.S. government has passed legislation, such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which systematically prohibits the import of goods from that region of China. These measures have been a model of responsibility, offering American companies protection against unfair competition from products manufactured under absolutely unacceptable conditions. In the meantime, the Canadian government, with no equivalent legislation, is allowing products made under slave labour conditions to enter freely. In 2023, no products were stopped at the Canadian border because of forced labour. While the U.S. intercepted thousands of shipments, Canada stood back and did nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716519">The lack of concrete measures puts our Canadian businesses at a disadvantage. They face foreign competition that uses absolutely unacceptable practices while benefiting from subsidies, weaker environmental regulations and inhumane labour practices. Our local manufacturers are subject to labour standards that ensure the dignity and safety of our workers. However, that generates additional costs that they have to cover in order to comply with these ethical principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716520">The injustice does not end there. Our businesses also have to pay carbon taxes and comply with strict regulations. Meanwhile, China is not subject to the same restrictions and continues to flood our markets with products manufactured in deplorable conditions. This distortion of competition directly compromises our ability to be competitive on international markets and jeopardizes not only our competitiveness but also the jobs of millions of Canadians. The Liberals have failed to deal with this direct threat against our economy and our principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716521">In its March 2023 budget, the government announced its intention “to introduce legislation by 2024 to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains to strengthen the import ban on goods produced using forced labour.” In its March 2024 budget, the government announced that it would implement a similar measure in 2024. To date, the government has not followed through on that commitment. It has not yet introduced any such legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716529">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that we have this time today to remind the government of the promise it made in the budget this year to table legislation to eliminate forced labour from Canadian supply chains. However, when I asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="278471" Type="2">Bay of Quinte</Affiliation> about whether his party would prioritize taking action on this, he said that we needed more competition. More competition is not going to solve getting rid of modern-day slavery and eliminating forced labour in Canadian supply chains.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8716532"> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this issue. It is important to recognize the significance of it, because this place and the other place, the Senate, have already passed some legislation with respect to forced labour. However, that fraudulent legislation never did the things for which New Democrats have called for many years. The products and the types of impacts for an economy are certainly significant, not only with regard to the impacts on the individuals, most often being children, but also prisons and other places that we have to compete against with respect to our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716533"> With respect to child labour, everybody likes to say that they are opposed to it, but at the same time they are knowingly allowing our supply chains to be affected by those types of economic contributors without repercussions. That is significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716534">The argument used to be that forced labour happened in some of the most suspicious companies out there. It may not have been mainstream companies, maybe ones not even traded on the stock market or ones that were from developing countries. In the last couple of years, we have seen an increase of forced labour in the supply chain, including by some companies in the United States, which were called out for this. This also included major automotive manufacturers, some of the gig economy and a number of different groups that we would not normally expect this type of behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716535">Over the years, we have talked about trade, trade agreements, opening the markets and ending this type of practice. It has been used as an excuse over and over. When we actually needed the fight to happen, thankfully the former member for Essex, Tracey Ramsey, who represented the NDP at that time, fought to include labour and the environment in the new NAFTA. We can call it the USMCA, CUMSA or NAFTA 2.0, but the reality is that we finally have taken some modest steps and have incorporated labour laws in that trade agreement, as well as the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716536"> That is significantly different, because the New Democrats raised this concern consistently as the country went down several different paths with regard to trade agreements. One after the other happened during the Harper regime and the Conservatives made sure that every time we tried to move amendments covering human rights, the environment and issues like child labour in the agreements, those amendments were defeated. Many of those countries still continue to have some of the practices we raised and they have an increased impact on our trade and supply chain to this day. The notion was that we were going to diversify our economy with these agreements, but we have seen the increase of these problems, not the decrease, related to the promises that were made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716537"> On top of that, it was often said that Canada would get into a supply surplus with regard to those countries we had signed agreements with, but we have not. With every agreement, except for the United States, we are in a trade deficit. Therefore, not only did we enter agreements where we have lost part of the economy and have become a deficit trading nation, we have also surrendered any opportunity to effectively negotiate improvements for the environment and the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716538">From a mere selfish point of view, with regard to the use of this reprehensible part of our economy, is the self-interest of Canadians. Some who have come from those countries continue to lose their jobs or do not get economic investment because of child and slave labour that is continually used within the system. A recent report talks about some of these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716539"> The motion we are dealing with was promised before, in 2023, and we were supposed to have improvements. There was well-recognized criticism that what we passed would not improve things whatsoever. Basically, it has done the worst of things, which is to provide a shield for the government to hide behind when we know these practices are increasing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716540"> We have also seen it in key parts of our economy like never before. I introduced legislation on knock-offs and other types of rip-offs related to copyright and other infringement, so CBSA officers could apprehend goods and services at the border and get proper training. Counterfeit issues like that are important for the New Democrats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716541">We may not think they are that important. Sometimes this involves running shoes, purses, clothing or other items, but it has escalated to airplane, automotive parts and hospital merchandise. One of the things was electrical panels. Even things that appear to be copyrighted properly are part of the sophistication of organized crime that uses child and slave labour as part of their repertoire to bring in profits that go to other types of crime across the globe. It is important to recognize that we are not dealing with this in the supply chain in our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716542">In the debates that took place before in this chamber, mostly from the Conservatives and Liberals at the time, it was noted that this would have an ill effect on the Canadian economy and consumers, so they had to risk keeping this and the environment out of trade agreements. The reality is that this will cost Canadians more in the future because the resources and profits from this into our supply chain is then used for other illegal activity. It is not like it goes back into the organizations growing their systems independently from that. The ones that use this are using other types of criminal activity with the resources from it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716543">It is one of the reasons why I fought for this for a number of years, and we did get the change. At one point, we used to be able to write off any environmental fine, penalty or criminal fine that took place as a business-related expense, and the NDP fixed that and had it eliminated through a budgetary process. I give Ralph Goodale credit. He had to write it into his budget because the rest of us collectively in the industry committee and others supported my motion to hold up the committee, and we doggedly pursued it. A number of different people, including all the opposition parties, were against the Liberals and fought it for over a month and a half until we got the Liberals to agree to do this. They finally did it after breaking their word three times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716544">Specifically, it involves hundreds of millions of dollars per year. There were cases at that time where drug companies were illegally manufacturing harmful drugs. They went through the court system and were fined up to $40 million, in one example, but then they got $11 million back at tax time as a business-related expense. There were other companies that did environmental damage and would later get part of that money back, up to 50%, at tax time as a business-related expense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716545">It did two things that were absurd. First, criminal activity should never be subsidized, but it had been for decades under Liberals and Conservatives prior to that. It was attractive to invest in Canada because companies could do whatever they wanted. They would get caught and then they could get some of that money back at tax time. Second, it was also used as a subsidy against businesses that wanted to do the right thing and invest in proper environmental and other practices. Instead of dumping oil down the sewer system or somewhere else or using capture, containment and treatment incentives, which costs more money, the subsidies of the people who got caught later on would be the incentive to do it again and again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716546">There is no difference with regard to this case. If there are no economic repercussions of any magnitude, from the smallest to the largest, it only encourages reinvestment into child labour or the support of countries that continue to turn a blind eye to child labour and a continued dependency model that does not allow free market forces to enter in a competitive nature and provide products that do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716547">One of the saddest examples I have seen of the abuse of this issue, in particular, is the decline in Toronto, but also, more specifically, the decline in Quebec of the garment industry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716548"> For many years, we saw different types of trade agreements go through. Other countries, knowing the problems with that, would get preferential treatment to the Canadian market despite us raising these issues. I think of Jordan as an example. I think of when we went to the Caribbean. I think of other countries that moved their garment industries, especially in the Montreal region and other parts of Quebec, overseas. At that time, we were sold the lie that we could not manufacture anymore because it was not competitive enough. We were told that there was nobody willing to invest, that the workers could not do the jobs and that was why we had to let the industry go overseas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716549"> We had the same philosophy with the tech industry. Everybody is complaining now because of the issues with respect to microchips. At one time, Canada was a world leader of that industry, which was in the Mississauga area of Ontario, but we let that go to a developing country. It is now the world leader. We are seeing the United States and others reshoring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716550"> It was the same with the garment industry at that time. We were told all these different things and the only thing we could do was to accept it as <I>fait accompli</I>. All we did was push the problems further on. Then what happens is that when workers reunite in those countries to push back about that, the operators of this behaviour just move to another country. I think about some of the workers in Mexico and other places like that. This pushes it further away and there still is no solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716551">I remember when we were looking at the current agreement under NAFTA with the workers who came from Mexico to Parliament Hill. The argument that was pushed against them, which was put out there by the right wing and those who believed in so-called free trade, was that it would take jobs away from those poor workers. If they wanted the same standards and the same or similar wages, then the companies would close and move those jobs unilaterally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716552"> However, what we heard from those workers was that they needed us to stand up for them because it would never solve itself, that we had to put the actual measures in the agreement so that they could stop these people from reshoring outside of their zone. There would be something legislative related to the trade in the trade agreement between Canada and the United States. It would give them some empowerment, because it made it more difficult for those companies to then close the shops. They were willing to take that risk because they knew, and what had always been the case, that every single time they fought for something it would be diminished, it would be eliminated. Instead of raising everybody up, or partially up, it would then be taken away. By not addressing this issue, we see what has taken place in the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716553"> One report that will come forward is on how child and forced labour continues to grow. Here are some statistics on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716554"> Canadian imports of risky goods totalled $34 billion in 2016, up from $26 billion in 2012, which is a 31% increase in the value of risky goods coming from countries with a higher incidence of child and or forced labour. It is pretty disturbing when we break out some of the data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716555"> There was a 42% increase in garment imports from Bangladesh. We have also seen what has taken place with climate change in Bangladesh. We have seen the extreme poverty. We have seen all those different things, and we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716556">There was a 97% increase in tomato imports from Mexico. That is significant for our region, which has the greenhouse industry. We have a number of different operators. As supply is increased into the market, we need to address this. This should be forced through our negotiations with NAFTA. We have to push on that harder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716557">There was a 107% increase in coffee imports from the Dominican Republic. That is another destination of choice for tourism, but at the same time, it has exploited the market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716558">There was a 124% increase in footwear imports from India. We can see again where we have had a detailed development take place in Canada with regard to the Modi government, not only with respect to how it operates but the difficulty in its own country with regard to human rights and the very openness of many things, including political and others. India's involvement in the Canadian electoral system and with respect to Canadian citizens should be a motivator for the government to bring into effect legislation that will be more significant to push back against that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716559">It is interesting. I saw this hands-off approach by Conservatives and Liberals first-hand. I am retired from hockey coaching at the moment, but I had a chance to coach for several years, until about seven years ago. Some parents on teams that we coached actually had people coming from India to train in the engineering field, then going back to India. They would take the job out of Canada. They actually had people coming into our country and training for those positions; people would then lose their job after training that person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716560">When we look at a country such as India, as in this instance, that should be motivation enough for the Liberal government to do this as a way of pushing back, very specifically and very carefully, to the benefit of many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716561"> There has been an 8,852% increase in palm oil imports from Indonesia. This is another country that has some well-documented issues with regard to its human rights record. In fact, I got involved in politics in Windsor, back in the day; at that time, it was the Indonesian genocide in East Timor that later led to some of my work for the genocide recognition of this place, of Srebrenica and others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716562"> There is a good, well-documented historical case there of problems. Do Canadians actually care about this issue? They do care. Right now, however, we do very little to educate Canadians, or to put information in front of the public, about who are the worst operators of this type of behaviour, and if they are in our supply chain, how we get them out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716563">If we are going to fall behind global leaders in regard to dealing with this, it would be at the expense of what Canadians want, and it is going to be at the expense of our jobs and our manufacturing. We saw what COVID did with the supply chain. It is interesting because it became attractive. There have been massive subsidies provided for the manufacturers and others over time to deal with the subsidization in other places with regard to the auto industry and other types of industries, including our buying a leaky pipeline and the umpteen billions that we are continuing to pay for, and paying interest on, as we are in a deficit projection right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716564"> There has been an increase in investment, and that should come with additional conditions in terms of supporting Canadians and their priorities. That is the way to deal with it. I was around all the time when they actually said, “No, we have to get into the service industry. We cannot do manufacturing anymore. It is not cost effective.” They said all that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716565">Now you see even the right wing in the United States pushing to try to get some of these jobs. We also have some of the right wing in the U.S. funding some of those jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716566">With regard to our position on this particular issue, we want to see the report come forward with the recommendations. We want to see Canada take advantage of tabling something. This is really important: Even if we table legislation here, it is not necessarily going to get through this chamber and the other chamber in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716567">If we look at and actually check the government reports on this, five days ago, it was still calling for information with regard to opinions on this. Everything that it is doing right now to say it is coming in at the end of the year is just basically a whitewash of the reality that we saw none of this come forward until this committee report pushed the issue even further. This is something that I support and that New Democrats support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716568"> We warned everyone that we would be in this situation. We warned that it is actually going to have a negative impact not only on the children's lives and the slave labour lives, but also the economy with regard to pushing Canadians with legitimate business interests and investment out of markets that they really should actually have an advantage in. That would provide taxes, resources, jobs and a series of different benefits. Then we would be able to help other countries with regard to bringing them into real compliance with our trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716569"> As I wrap up here, I would say that it is really important to notice that we are in this situation for a reason. It is because successive Conservative and Liberal governments have been comfortable with this hidden secret, and when the rock is turned over, every single time, we see things scurry out. We know what is in there. It is also in parts of our newer economy as well. When we look at some of the electronics and some of the brands that are involved, we know that this is not going anywhere. In fact, it is getting deeper, as the stats I just read show. It will also play out across the globe with regard to minerals, resources and so forth. We are creating a dependency model, and all members in this chamber should be very uncomfortable because we actually set ourselves up to be at this point.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716575">Madam Speaker, I actually appreciate this question. It is an interesting case. I am somewhat familiar with the sugar beet issue because it is part of how dependent we have become upon others for refining. We can start to look at some of the refining in Canada, for example, even the refining of rice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716576">The member brings up a really interesting point, which is that we are actually creating more production costs by having to ship products to the United States and deal with all kinds of different things. We do not have a good system in place to deal with it, and we could actually have the investment grow for refining, replacing manufacturing equipment and so forth. That is why I have been a strong supporter of the capital cost reduction allowance as part of manufacturing and making sure that the actual equipment gets the subsidy and not the company, or reduced taxation, so that the equipment gets there. It is harder to take the equipment away, and this actually allows for the increased thing. Sugar beet refining is a good example of several sectors out there that may seem single and small on their own, but when we start to lump them together, we are losing our impact.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716581">Madam Speaker, it was the Harper administration that really exposed us to and brought in this foreign worker program in 2014. We saw some things that were being done by the operators in this program, which are the companies. They have often been some of the larger companies, but there have also been family-owned ones that were very wealthy. I have seen this in the agriculture sector around my neck of the woods, for sure. The response by the Conservatives and Liberals on this issue was to subsidize the corporations and these rich families with more money, living condition supports and other types of taxpayer supports to help offset the cruelty that was taking place on their almost plantation-like systems of bringing foreign workers in there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716582">The excuse was that they could not find any Canadians for these types of things. At the same time, we had lots of Canadians in my riding who were willing to go out there, but they had no form of transportation. The wages are low, the training is bad, and the investment is poor. The response has always been to provide more subsidies to the corporations and to the rich families. That has to end. Canadians want to work, but there has to be proper transportation and safety; they have to be paid a fair market wage. Those are the reasons we see issues of fairness depressed with regard to wages and working conditions. It has to end.</ParaText>

I was in this chamber when the Liberals, under their current leader, supported Stephen Harper over 110 times on confidence motions without getting a single thing from the Conservatives at that time. There was nothing on the environment, nothing on the economy, nothing on human rights and nothing at all for anybody on anything. Therefore, we will take no lectures from the Liberals in terms of their dilemma on how they deal with things. I saw the physical evidence as the Harper government tore down labour rights, tore down environmental issues and invested in things that were not good for Canadians. During that time, we had austerity issues get reversed, and the Conservatives actually ran up one of the largest deficits in Canadian history. All of that was done with the support of the Liberal Party unilaterally, with not a single condition over 110 votes. That is important to note because that is the real history of Canada. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716593">Madam Speaker, respect for human rights, labour and the environment lies at the heart of our trade policies and our high-standard trade agreements. Canada's trade agreements prioritize Canadian values, focusing on workers' rights, environmental standards and opportunities for under-represented businesses like SMEs, women-owned businesses and indigenous enterprises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716594"> It is the current government that signed the CPTPP, CETA and the new CUSMA agreement with our largest trading partners in both the U.S. and Mexico, and we will continue to create more jobs through trade as we continue to focus on opening new markets for Canadian businesses. More Canadian products shipped abroad means more good-paying Canadian jobs in communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716595"> I think it is safe to say that members of the House deplore the continued existence of forced labour in today's global supply chains. It is a priority that is very important to our government and that we have included in our budget to very clearly state that we would have legislation introduced by the end of this year. However, as we have seen, the Conservative members who continue to gum up the House, paralyzing the House and wasting millions of dollars are in fact blocking very important legislation like this from coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716596"> For those watching, it is important to note that the official opposition is in fact opposing the very legislation we were hoping to bring forward, by blocking and paralyzing the chamber using ill-informed tactics that no Canadians appreciate. Canadians want us to be able to work together to bring forward legislation that would help eradicate forced labour in our supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716597"> Forced labour traps workers in conditions of exploitation and abuse. It is a denial of human freedom and dignity. Forced labour is wholly incompatible with building a more prosperous, fairer global economy. It is a practice that undermines jobs and businesses where fundamental labour rights are respected. Enterprises that use and profit from forced labour not only deny the rights of their workers but also prevent Canadians and Canadian businesses from competing on a level playing field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716598"> Forced labour contradicts the values that we as Canadians share with so many other people around the world. It is a practice that Canada and the rest of the international community must look to end. There is no question that eradicating forced labour is both an essential task and urgent one. I therefore welcome the opportunity to inform the House about actions the government is taking to maintain Canada's leadership in the global effort to eradicate forced labour and to uphold workers' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716599"> Members of the House will recall that Canada introduced a forced labour import prohibition in 2020. The change was part of implementing our trade agreement with the United States and Mexico, CUSMA. The prohibition operates to stop goods from entering Canada that are mined, manufactured or produced wholly or in part by forced labour or compulsory child labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716600">I am proud to say that Canada was the second country in the world, after only the United States, to implement a ban on forced labour imports. The import ban remains a vital part of our effort to eradicate forced labour from Canada's international supply chains. It is also important to delivering on the common goal of all the CUSMA partners to eliminate all forms of forced labour. That is why the government has committed to introducing legislation this year that would make Canada's ban even stronger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716601">In October, the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development</Affiliation> launched public consultations on potential measures to strengthen the import ban. As part of this process, the government has published and is seeking feedback on concrete options to enhance the ban. The options include a possible requirement for importers of publicly designated at-risk goods to provide additional documentation on the supply chain journey of those goods when seeking to bring them into Canada. In short, this would place an onus on importers to demonstrate why the ban should not apply to any designated at-risk goods they wish to bring into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716602"> The government shares the ambition of members of the House to strengthen Canada's forced labour import ban, but at the same time the government recognizes the importance of consulting with all Canadians to ensure that any new measures would be effective and fit for purpose while maintaining Canada's economic competitiveness. We look forward to hearing from Canadian consumers, businesses and other stakeholders through the consultation process launched earlier this fall and to moving forward once their voices have been heard.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716603"> The government is committed to protecting labour rights and promoting responsible business practices in Canada's international supply chains. I know that all members of the House share these goals, including the goal of the eradication of forced labour in Canadian supply chains. The government looks forward to working with members of the House to adopt legislation to strengthen the ban and to give Canadians greater confidence that goods imported into Canada are not tainted by forced labour. My hope is the Conservatives and the Bloc end their silly tactics to jam the House so we can bring legislation forward to fight forced labour and support Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716604">As we heard from both the RCMP and the Auditor General, there are processes in place for members of the House to bring forward concerns, and the Speaker has ruled on this as well, to further study the issue at committee. As we have heard, members opposite rightfully raise concerns of forced labour, and I hope they end their delay tactics in the House to seize up the floor so we can bring forward legislation on forced labour, which is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716605">We mentioned very clearly in our budget that we want to be able to bring forward legislation to make sure we eradicate forced labour from our supply chains. We know it impacts Canadian businesses. We want businesses to remain competitive, but again, it is very important for those watching at home to know that we are able to table and introduce the legislation while hearing the concerns of the Conservatives and the Bloc, but it is also important we bring forward legislation that supports Canadians and ends forced labour in our supply chains.</ParaText>

I asked the member at committee, as well as outside the committee, whether, if this was so important and such a high priority for him, he would commit to ending what is happening in the House of Commons, the delay tactics, so we can ensure that we bring the important legislation forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716610">While there is more to do, our government already has a number of measures in place to address forced labour, including enforceable labour provisions in free trade agreements and providing assistance to partner countries. We all know this is a very complex issue that transcends international borders. We will continue to work with all colleagues here and of course abroad to introduce new requirements and enforce existing bans on goods made with forced labour. As I said in my speech, there have been consultations going on over the last couple of months with the businesses, industries and stakeholders that have a very important role to play in the conversation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716611"> Madam Speaker, in the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, there is a provision to prevent the use of forced labour in supply chains. The United States enacted strict and bold legislation to do this four years ago. It has seized goods worth $3.62 billion because it took it seriously. The Liberal government has not taken it seriously. I know the Bloc Québécois cares about it and I know the NDP cares about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716612">The Liberals do not care, because they have seized zero goods, not a single dollar's worth of goods in four years. They talk about some proposed legislation and say that they are doing this and doing that, but what they have done has accomplished nothing. How can the member stand here and justify the U.S.'s seizing 3.62 billion dollars' worth of goods and the corrupt Liberal government's seizing zero?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716620"> Madam Speaker, I listened intently to the comments that the parliamentary secretary shared, and I appreciated the approach he was taking because I do believe that within the House of Commons we have important work to do, which includes government legislation and private members' legislation. Private member's bills have not been able to advance because the Conservatives refuse to put our country and our communities first. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has silenced 18 Conservative members from even advancing housing issues and supporting municipalities. I am talking about fewer than 15% of members on their benches who are actually supporting municipalities by ensuring that their communities have adequate housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716621">Conservatives will choose Conservative partisan politics before they will choose Canada. That is an approach we saw under former prime minister Stephen Harper, and we will see it happen again, so I hope Canadians are paying attention. Today the Bloc is defending the Conservative approach, which I find disappointing. I do usually appreciate the approach the Bloc members take because they tend to advance policy rather than partisan politics, but I know they want to divide our country. I do not stand for that. The NDP showed clearly in the by-election that it will also choose partisan politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716622">Why is it that we are not able to advance legislation on the topic? I believe it is a really important topic, so I would like to hear the member's comments.</ParaText>

The member has a very good point: With the Conservatives' teaming up with other opposition parties gumming up the House, we are not able to bring forward important private member bills to ensure that we are able to support Canadians or even speak of legislation that can be tabled in the House, should the Conservatives end their delay tactics and filibusters and wasting millions of dollars by gumming up the House and delivering the same speech over and over again.</ParaText>

It is as a result of the corrupt Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716631">I have the former minister of labour's mandate letter from 2021, almost four years ago. The mandate letter says:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With the support of the Minister of Public Safety, the Minister of Public Services and Procurement and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, introduce legislation to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains....</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716633">That was in 2021. I just checked and it is 2024. No, we have not been asleep for these past three years. We have just watched the corrupt, incompetent Liberal government do absolutely nothing on this file. Why would the government not do anything? Our largest trading partner, the United States, took bold action right away and has had remarkable success in seizing goods made with forced labour. Canada, on the other hand, has seized one shipment and then released it. That is the Liberal track record on forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716634">We have to ask ourselves why. Why have the Liberals not done anything about it? Is it because, perhaps, Beijing-controlled companies donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Trudeau Foundation? That could be it. Could it be, according to journalist Sam Cooper, that members of the Liberal cabinet have been co-opted by Beijing influence? That could be one of the reasons. The result of this has been an embarrassment, and our trading partners are taking notice, including the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716635">We have an issue that has not gone away. In fact, in October 2022, a mere two years ago, the former minister of labour was at committee and I presented what was going on: The United States had taken bold action. It published an entities list that listed dozens and dozens of Chinese corporations that it knew were engaging in the use of Uyghur forced labour. Those entities were banned from bringing goods into the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716636">I asked the minister why the Liberals did not just copy it. If they cannot do the work themselves, why would they not just take it? I offered to hand it to the minister. I said we could cut down on goods coming in with forced labour right now. It would take five minutes. Did the Liberals do it? No, of course they did not. They did not use the United States' entities list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716637">What has been the result? The United States has now seized 3.62 billion dollars' worth of goods that were made with forced labour. Over the same period of time, how many goods made with forced labour has the corrupt Liberal government seized? Does anyone want to hazard a guess? Do any of the Liberal members want to hazard a guess? I will tell them how much: zero, nothing. The Liberals seized one shipment and had to turn it back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716638">One might ask why, if the Liberals went through the step of seizing these goods, they would ship them back. That is an interesting question. It comes down to the rules that Canada adopted to allow CBSA to seize goods. Those in the United States know this is tough, so they said that if a shipment is suspected of being made with forced labour, whoever is importing or shipping the goods would have to prove that they were not made with forced labour. The onus, the burden, goes back to companies, and of course, since most of them cannot prove it, the U.S. seized 3.62 billion dollars' worth of goods.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716639"> What did the corrupt Liberal government do for the standard? It set the standard that the CBSA has to prove the goods were made with forced labour, which, with the resources the CBSA has, it cannot do. The CBSA seized one shipment, but could not prove that it was made with forced labour, so it was allowed to come into the country. The Liberals are actively allowing this to happen. They have taken no steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716640">The minister was obligated in his mandate letter to introduce legislation. It has been almost four years, and the minister has not introduced a single piece of legislation to cut down on this. The government has not changed the standard that it forced the CBSA to adopt, which does not make it easier to seize goods made with forced labour. As a result, the CBSA has seized nothing. We know that goods coming into Canada are made with forced labour, and I think Canadians would be outraged if they knew they might be buying goods made with forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716641">Forced labour is a despicable way to produce goods, and there have been videos and exposés on how this is happening, particularly in the Xinjiang region of China. For the Liberals to have done nothing is, quite frankly, disgusting. They now stand here and hide behind their refusal to provide documents from the green slush fund, as if this is the problem. They have had four years to do something. The debate on their failure to produce documents to show their corruption has been going on for four weeks, but this is suddenly the problem. This shows how bereft of a moral compass the government is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716642"> I will go back to why this has happened. Why is Canada not doing anything under the Liberals to seize these goods? Is it because Beijing-controlled companies donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Trudeau Foundation? I do not know, but it looks a little fishy. Is it because there have been exposés by journalists who have made it very clear that there is a lot of influence from Beijing in the Liberal Party's cabinet?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716643">When we look at the results of this, we are led to the conclusion that, as Shakespeare said, “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.” There is something rotten in the Liberal government. It has been woefully inadequate in its response to the forced labour issue, and there are serious consequences to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716644">The United States is our largest trading partner. Canada is a trading nation. It is in our free trade agreement with the United States that we have to eliminate forced labour from our supply chains. The government has not done that. It has not done a single thing in four years, and there will be consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716645">A giant report was just delivered to the United States Senate on forced labour in supply chains, and guess where the U.S. is point the finger. It is at Canada and Mexico. It is despicable that the government has done nothing to crack down on this while Chinese corporations abuse Uyghurs in forced labour camps and send goods to Canada with no fear of consequences. The government's lack of action is disgusting enough, but now it is putting our trading relationship with the United States in jeopardy. Why is it doing that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716646">There is something very rotten going on with the Liberal government on this issue. As I said at committee to the minister, the government could take quick steps right away. It could adopt the entities list that the United States has published. The United States government did its due diligence. It looked into companies that are known to produce things in the Xinjiang region of China or have supply chains that have goods that come from there, and it said these entities could not export goods to the United States. The government could just copy and paste that. I know the government has a hard time doing anything and copying and pasting would be so much work, but that is a simple way to right away crack down on the issue. It has not; it has refused. Canadians should wonder why.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716670">Madam Speaker, I can see that you are upset today, and I do not blame you; Canadians are upset with this debate we are having today. The fact that we are having this debate has Canadians upset because they thought this was being taken care of. They thought this issue was being addressed by legislation. Canadians would not believe what is going on and what has been going on at our borders and how the current government has broken our border system and broken our systems altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716671">I rise today to speak to this very important issue regarding forced and child labour in the supply chains and why the government must do more to rid the country of this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716672"> Before I begin, I will give a bit of history. On January 1, the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act, known as the supply chains act, came into effect. It was not a great bill, but at least it was something. I was happy to see this private member's bill pass, as I voted for it along with nearly everyone in this House. That bill was the first step in Canada's long road to ridding our supply chains of forced labour and child labour. By asking the government departments and private businesses if their supply chains carry a risk of forced or child labour, we can begin to properly measure the size of the problem and take steps toward a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716673"> In this scenario, we are just talking about finding a benchmark. We are just trying to see how big the problem possibly could be. I will compare it to what my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278504" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation>, the shadow minister for labour, talked about in regard to what has been going on in the U.S. The Americans are not just identifying; they are actually taking action. We are at least identifying the issue. In the case of the supply chains act, identifying a risk of forced labour means that the government department or business determines there is some possibility that forced or child labour might have been used. However, what was learned by implementing the supply chains act is that Canada was late to the table. Numerous other jurisdictions have already implemented forced labour laws. This list includes the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the Australian Modern Slavery Act. Many of our closest allies and trading partners drew the world's attention to the problem of modern slavery in supply chains and passed meaningful legislation to work toward a solution, but the current government took nearly six years to finally pass legislation and still fails to meaningfully enact it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716674"> The Canada supply chains act took numerous years to become law. It was first proposed in 2021 and only received royal assent on January 1, 2024. The government was well aware of its pending implementation. In fact, many Liberals voted for this bill, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself. With near-unanimous consent by members of the government, supported by His Majesty's loyal opposition, and three committee hearings at the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, the government members cannot plead ignorant to the issue of forced labour in supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716675"> That then leads me to the matter we are debating here today: the government's failure to propose meaningful legislation that rids the supply chains of forced labour once and for all. Today's motion, that the 21st report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade presented on Wednesday, October 30 be concurred in, is an embarrassment for the current Liberal government. What we are debating here today is for the government to acknowledge that it has been dragging its heels with respect to implementing meaningful legislation that would combat forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716676">Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>, while a positive step forward, is a limited step forward. It was limited in its mandate and, through the reports submitted by the Department of Public Safety, we have learned the Government of Canada and private businesses have a glaring problem. It was not as if the government was not aware of this, though. In the Liberals' budget presented in March 2023, the Liberal government indicated its intention to introduce anti-forced labour legislation by the end of 2024. The Liberals then followed up this spring with a statement and repeated themselves in the latest budget presentation in March, again indicating they wish to present anti-forced labour legislation by the end of 2024. It is now November 19 and there is no legislation in sight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716677"> This is a grave dereliction of duty as it is the government's legislation that is required to fix this problem. Ignorance of the problem here is no excuse; it is simply laziness and incompetence. The Liberal government has been aware of the problem for years. Its own ministers voted on the topic in two budgets in 2023 and 2024. It was indicated that it was a priority for the government and yet, nothing has happened. In the meantime, we have received government reports from the Department of Public Safety demonstrating the scale of the issue and the number of government departments that have identified a risk of forced or child labour in their supply chains. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716678"> I would like to make clear just how significant the problem of forced labour is in our Canadian supply chains and to do this, it is important to look at the statistics on the matter. Before I jump into those, I would ask my colleagues in the House to remember what we are really discussing here today. Modern slavery is not a singular problem. These are individuals and, in many cases, children who are victims of an abusive system. The supply chains act, Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>, mandates the Government of Canada to prepare an annual report highlighting the prevalence of forced and child labour in the supply chain. With responses by government departments, agencies and private businesses, the Minister of Public Safety is responsible for tabling an annual report to Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716679">This past September 30, we received the government's inaugural report, and it was not positive. In the report entitled “2024 Annual Report to Parliament on the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act”, the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> outlined the degree to which the government sourced supplies that carry the risk of forced labour. This is the report, a very damning report, excuse use my language, to the government, as the statistics will tell us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716680">In 2024, 17.2%, of government institutions had identified that parts of their activities and supply chains had a risk of forced labour or child labour being used. Almost 20% of the government's own departments identified the possibility of child labour or slavery being used in their supply chains, the people they buy from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716681">Some 37.9% of government institutions started the process of identifying the risks, but highlighted that there were still gaps in the assessment. That tells us that a good chunk of departments still have not even done a full assessment at this point in time, yet almost 20% of those supply chains are at risk of using forced or child labour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716682">Some 44.8% had not started the process of identifying risks at all. That means 44% of government departments have not even gone through the process that they are mandated to do. We are getting stats of 17.2% of the supply chains for government without 44% of them even reporting. What is the actual number? It is disgusting, declaringly horrible, and yet the government has done nothing to fix it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716683">To remedy the glaring issue that 17.2% of government departments that identified risk of forced labour in their supply chains, only two government institutions indicated they had implemented actions to prevent forced or child labour and associated harms from reoccurring. In all the government departments, only two are doing something, meaning there are numerous government institutions that are aware they have forced or child labour problems and have not done anything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716684">However, what I find even more concerning is that while responding to the questions was mandatory, again 44.8% of government institutions did not even start the process of identifying risks in their supply chain. Ignorance of the law excuses no one. “The head of every government institution must, on or before May 31 of each year, report to the Minister on the steps the government institution has taken during its previous financial year to prevent and reduce the risk that forced labour or child labour is used at any step of the production of goods produced, purchased or distributed by the government institution.” This is a direct quote from Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> himself voted for. Why has he not enforced the laws he is mandated to enforce? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716685">To conclude, it is beyond unacceptable that the Liberal government is not giving the attention that is required to remove forced labour from our supply chains. It is beyond unacceptable that the government continues to drag its heels on meaningful legislation that would rid our supply chains of forced labour. It is beyond unacceptable that 17% of government institutions had identified parts of their activities and supply chains that carry a risk of forced labour or child labour being used. It is beyond unacceptable that only two government institutions are trying to do something about it. The fact that 44% of government institutions could just opt out of reporting is also horrible, and it is ridiculous that the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> failed to do his job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716686">In fact, it is quite telling how little the government cares about removing forced and child labour that its own ministers and departments missed mandatory deadlines and failed to report information they are required to report. Forced and child labour in our supply chains has been identified as a leading issue by our allies. It is time we take it seriously. The impact this has on those who are exploited is unimaginable. Vulnerable people and children are victims of the government's inattentiveness and claiming that it did not know is inexcusable and, frankly, untrue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716687">It is time the government take the issue of forced labour and child labour seriously, and remove it from the government procurement process and our store shelves. We can see there are lots of things to talk about regarding this issue and there is not enough time. I have not even talked about the implications on trade and what it means to our allies when we are laggards.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716706">The concept of the bill was introduced to me at least four or five years ago, when World Vision sponsored some British legislators to come to Canada to talk about their version of this kind of transparency bill. I was kind of attracted to the idea. I thought it was a good idea, so I thought to myself, well, let us put together a piece of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716707">We put together a piece of legislation and, of course, the process being the process that it is around here, the legislation died on the Order Paper, and we had an election, so that went nowhere. Then I did it again in the interim between 2019 and 2021, and it, too, went nowhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716708"> Meanwhile, both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party decided that this was something that should be in a platform. If we read the platforms of both parties, the commitments mirror Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document> by some considerable measure. Both the Conservatives and the Liberals thought that transparency legislation would be good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716709">By this time, we thought maybe we should get a little bit smarter and introduce the legislation in the Senate. Then we would not be hampered by the peculiar rules of the House of Commons, where there is an order of precedence, and if a member is unlucky, their legislation is at the bottom of the order of precedence. However, if the member is lucky, they are at the top and get a chance to run a piece of legislation through the House during a mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716710"> Then 2021 came along, and it was in both parties' platforms. We had a draft bill on order, ready to go. Indeed, four cabinet ministers had this kind of legislation in their mandate, and, arguably, this kind of legislation would have fulfilled the mandate obligations in their mandate letters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716711">We took the bill and made it a stronger piece of legislation than that in England, Australia or California. Canada went from laggard to leader in the process. We started the bill in the Senate this time, as the Senate does not have the peculiar rules of this place, and we were fortunate to be able to get the bill dealt with in an expeditious manner, virtually without amendment. Then it came here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716712">When it came up on the Order Paper, we had virtually the unanimous consent of members, and I think it was a unanimous vote, to move the bill from the floor of the House to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716713"> Then we had other parties, particularly the Bloc and the NDP, wanting to bolt onto the bill a whole bunch of things, which broadly could be described as due diligence. In simple language, due diligence in this case essentially meant that, if one discovers the supply chain flaw, they actually have to fix it. That is in the legislation that is in Germany and in France. It is an appearance of a good idea without actually being a good idea.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716714">The immediate consequence of comparing due diligence in France with Canadian transparency legislation is that it would eliminate 98% of Canadian companies because the threshold for the French legislation was companies with at least 5,000 employees. Canada does not have that many companies with 5,000 employees. Because all the companies below that threshold would not have any obligation to comply with anything, we would have had an appearance of doing something good when the reality was something else, so we resisted the notion that we could bolt on due diligence legislation to this transparency bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716715">We did make it a transparency bill on steroids because, unlike what was done with the Australian or English legislation, we brought in obligations to government entities, the theory being that we cannot tell people what to do and then not do it ourselves. If I have a disappointment, as my friend previous alluded to, it is that I wish that, in the final report, the government entities, and they are not just federal government entities but Canadian government entities, would have complied at a more vigorous rate than they ended up doing. However, we put that into the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716716">The other thing that was really unique about this bill that gave it some more teeth was that we obligated the senior leadership of the entity to sign the report. When a CEO or CFO signs a report, it becomes a public document. The consequence of becoming a public document is that various other entities read it. Suddenly, if one is borrowing $100 million, the bank will read their supply chain report. If we had not put that in, one could say whatever they wanted to say. Now one has to have a sign-off from the CEO or CFO and it becomes a board obligation in the same way that, if one files a prospectus, one has to say that the statements in it are true and swear that those statements are true. Therefore, in the ultimate implementation of the legislation, which was over 6,000 entities, there were a lot of lawyers and a lot of compliance officers reviewing these statements for their truthfulness and accuracy. It became a pretty interesting disclosure of a significant amount of data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716717">When we went to the committee, we lost the support of the Bloc and the NDP, who in my judgment made foolish decisions about bolting onto a piece of legislation something the legislation was not designed for in the enthusiasm to run before one walks or finding perfection before one gets to the good. We then got it to the House for the final debate. The Conservative Party and the Liberal Party supported the bill. The cabinet supported the bill, and it received royal assent in May of 2023. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716718">Then there was a period of time between May 2023 and the coming into force date of January 1, 2024, when guidance was written on how to report. There were extensive consultations with the industry writ large, the entities that would be caught by this legislation. I attended a number of seminars. I know that public safety gave a number of seminars. The information was collated and the drafting of the expectations of the report was put together somewhere about this time last year. That is probably where it ultimately landed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8716719"> It came into force on January 1 of this year. The first reporting period was May of this year, and to my surprise, over 6,000 entities responded. The trouble is that we do not know out of how many. Maybe 10,000 entities should have responded. That is one of the flaws in the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716720">The report was then tabled in September of this year. I have it on my table here. One thing that is disturbing about it is that 38% of the entities that responded confirmed they had identified that parts of their activities and supply chains carried the risk of forced labour, which means that 38% of 6,000 filing entities say they think they have a problem. These are the entities that responded. We have no information on those that did not respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716721">The Speaker and I have spoken personally about this before. Canada has a significant problem with slave products in our supply chains. We are all members of a larger Canadian society, and we need to deal with this issue. I would urge colleagues to urge the government to disaggregate this data so that we know what problem we have. Also, as members have alluded to, we have a problem at the border. It is a real problem, a personal problem, and not only that, but it is becoming an international trade problem. One can be reasonably assured that this will come up in future negotiations for the USMCA and with various other trade groups.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716734">As several members pointed out, including the members for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278717" Type="2">Kitchener Centre</Affiliation>, there are sometimes situations where members of all parties wear pins, ribbons or displays to show their support for a particular cause and this elicits no reaction. In other cases, objections are raised as some feel they are being used as props to emphasize a political point about which there is some disagreement.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8716735"> The Chair is in no way commenting on the worthiness of any particular cause, as I know members, as do all Canadians in general, hold strong views on a variety of subjects. However, our practice in this place is that members express their points of view through their words and their votes rather than through displays. Therefore, the litmus test just described, that is, whether a button or a pin causes disorder, will continue to guide the Chair in enforcing this rule of decorum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716736">Now, given the wide scope of interpretation involved, the Chair seeks the co-operation of all members to be judicious in choosing to wear buttons or pins and to be equally judicious in choosing to raise their concern with the Chair.

The results from this study indicated as follows. A two-parent, middle-income family with two children spends about $293,000, on average, from birth to age 17, an average of $17,235 per year, raising a child. Two-parent families with two children and an annual income of more than $135,790 spent on average $403,910 per child from birth to age 17. The same sized family making less than $83,013, by comparison, spent on average 52% less per child, or $238,190. One-parent families with two children and an annual average income of less than $83,013 spent on average $231,260 per child from birth to age 17, while those making $83,013 or more spent $372,110 per child.

              <ParaText id="8716809">Mr. Speaker, starting in 2024-25, the Government of Canada is providing $2 billion over 10 years, or $200 million annually, through the indigenous health equity fund in support of indigenous-led approaches to increase access to quality and culturally safe health care services. Since it was announced in 2023-24, Indigenous Services Canada, ISC, has been working with first nations, Inuit and Métis partners on its design and implementation. As a result, this funding has two components. First, there is distinctions-based funding, which means long-term, predictable and flexible support for first nations, Inuit and Métis health priorities, at approximately $190 million annually. Second, there is targeted initiatives funding, which means short-term support to indigenous organizations for innovative, activity-driven and crosscutting indigenous health priorities, at approximately $10 million annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716810">With respect to distinctions-based funding, this funding support is being distributed annually as follows: $142.5 million for first nations, $28.5 million for Inuit and $19 million for Métis. For first nations, funding is being distributed on the basis of population, with adjustments for community size and remoteness. For Inuit, allocations to the four Inuit treaty organizations are being provided as per the direction of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami’s board of directors, which is consistent with the Inuit Nunangat policy. For Métis, allocations to the Manitoba Métis Federation and current governing members of the Métis National Council are being provided as per their historical resolution on funding distribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716811">With respect to implementation, it is important to note that the administration of funding is shared between ISC and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, with the former responsible for the distribution of funding to first nations and administration of the targeted initiatives program, and with the latter responsible for the distribution of funding to modern treaty and self-governing first nations, Inuit and Métis. While funding is currently in the process of being distributed to some partners, both departments are continuing to have discussions with regional indigenous leadership on how best to distribute this funding to their communities, which is respecting the principle of indigenous self-determination. Once these discussions conclude, funding will be fully transferred pending receipt of their implementation plans, which will provide both departments a sense of their priorities in health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716812">With respect to targeted initiatives, the program launched a call for proposal process on June 3, 2024. The deadline for submissions was July 31, 2024. Through this process, the program received nearly 60 proposals totalling more than $24 million. The department is finalizing its review, and decisions on funding are expected by the end of October. As a result, it would be premature to provide information on who submitted plans at this point in time. More information on specific projects that will be funded under this program will be forthcoming once decisions are finalized and communicated respectively with indigenous organizations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716816">Mr. Speaker, the following reflects a consolidated response approved on behalf of Global Affairs Canada, GAC, ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716817">With regard to part (a), on September 27, 2023, the Government of Canada publicly announced funding for two development assistance projects, valued at a total of $14 million, in support of Afghan refugees and host-communities impacted by the 2022 flood crisis in Pakistan. Of the total $14 million announced, $10 million in development assistance funding was provided by the Government of Canada and directly received by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for project implementation efforts within Pakistan. Of the total $14 million announced, $4 million in development assistance funding was provided by the Government of Canada and directly received by the World Health Organization, WHO, for project implementation efforts within Pakistan. None of the $14 million announced by the Government of Canada was provided to or received by other recipients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716818">With regard to part (b), the funds provided to UNHCR by the Government of Canada supported essential services for Afghan refugees and host communities grappling with the flood crisis in Pakistan. The $10 million in development assistance funded a bilateral Government of Canada project entitled “Essential Services to Afghan Refugees and Host Communities in Pakistan”. The Government of Canada allocated the full $10 million in development funding to this project. It is fully administered directly by UNHCR in Pakistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716819">With regard to part (c), the development funding provided by the Government of Canada to WHO was in support of health services to Afghan refugees and host communities in flood affected areas in Pakistan. The $4 million in development assistance supported the project entitled “Health Assistance for Afghan Refugees and Host Communities in Pakistan”. This project received the full $4 million allocation. It is administered directly by WHO in Pakistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716820">With regard to part (d), project funds were directly provided by the Government of Canada to UNHCR and WHO for programming delivered to support Afghan refugees and host-communities located within Pakistan. Global Affairs Canada exercises due diligence to oversee and monitor project implementation and delivery to ensure the effective use of Canadian funds for approved purposes. These efforts include, but are not limited to, visiting project implementation sites in Pakistan, meeting with project partners and beneficiaries in Pakistan and requiring that programing partners provide the Government of Canada with project financial and results reporting. In addition, the Government of Canada includes anti-terrorism clauses in its funding agreements with humanitarian and development partners to prevent funds from being diverted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716823">Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, IRCC, uses advanced analytics, AA; artificial intelligence, AI; and other non-AI-based automated decision support systems to identify routine applications for streamlined processing and make positive decisions on these applications, as well as to perform other functions, such as the sorting of applications based on common characteristics and flagging potential risk factors that may then be investigated by an officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716824">This enables IRCC to automate some processing steps for routine applications. By leveraging technology, IRCC is able to direct officer resources toward more complex applications and increase the efficiency of our processing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716825">These systems do not use opaque AI, do not automatically learn or adjust on their own and are not used to refuse any applications, recommend refusing applications or deny entry to Canada.  IRCC does not use any external generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, in support of decision-making on client applications.  IRCC officers remain central to immigration processing and continue to exercise their authority and discretion in decision-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716826">With regard to part (b), IRCC is aware that the use of AI in the processing of applications raises concerns related to bias, transparency, privacy, accuracy, reliability, etc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716827">At this time, none of IRCC’s automated decision support tools, including those that have been developed with AA and AI, can refuse an application, nor can they recommend a refusal to an officer. All final decisions to refuse applications are made by officers after individualized assessments of a file. Officers are provided with training on IRCC’s automated decision support systems in order to ensure they understand that a lack of an automated approval does not constitute a recommendation to refuse an application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716828">To address AI concerns or issues, IRCC follows the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, TBS, directives and conducts algorithmic impact assessments, AIA, for all relevant automated processes and tool systems that play a role in administrative decision-making, whether these systems use AI or not. The AIA is a Government of Canada governance process intended to assist in determining risk and mitigate potential negative impacts of automated decision-making systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716829">The department has developed detailed guidance, which includes a policy playbook on automated support for decision-making, to help consider how these technologies can be used responsibly, effectively and efficiently. IRCC has also established an internal governance framework to ensure that AI support tools go through a rigorous review and approval process, which includes coordination with legal experts, policy experts and privacy experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716830">Furthermore, IRCC has endorsed its comprehensive AI strategy, which is being finalized to be published in the coming months. This strategy outlines the department’s responsible approach to AI adoption, and places a significant emphasis on implementing strong AI governance while integrating new policies, guidelines and best practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716831">With regard to part (c), IRCC uses AI beyond application processing: IRCC is piloting AI for fraud detection, for triaging client emails to provide faster replies and for aiding research and policy development. IRCC also uses AI-powered computer vision to help validate identities, to crop passport photos and, for the online citizenship test, to prevent cheating. IRCC uses natural language processing to categorize client enquiries, freeing officers for client support, which powers QUAID, a chatbot for handling general enquiries with pre-set responses. Lastly, IRCC has opened up public generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and CoPilot, for employees to use for personal productivity  regarding drafting emails, translation, drafting presentations, etc., and has provided guidance to employees aligned to the TBS policy on the use of generative AI for personal productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716832">In alignment with the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act, IRCC has drafted internal guidance on the use of generative artificial intelligence in application processing. Employees have been clearly informed that entering personal, sensitive, classified and protected information into external AI tools is non-compliant with the Privacy Act and IRCC’s approach. Additionally, IRCC is educating employees and following TBS’s newly published “Generative AI in your daily work” directive, found at https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/generative-ai-your-daily-work.html, which describes how generative AI should and should not be used. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716906"> Madam Speaker, Canadians are getting poorer while Liberal insiders are getting richer. That is not my opinion; that is a fact. Per capita GDP is declining. It is lower now than it was nine years ago when the Liberal government was first elected. The total value of all the goods and services produced in Canada, divided by all the people in Canada, is shrinking. It is not shrinking in the United States. It is not shrinking in the rest of the G7 or the G20, but it is shrinking in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716907"> It is a fact that Canadians are getting poorer under the Liberal government. However, well-connected Liberal insiders have been getting richer over the last nine years under the Liberal government. That is also a fact; it is not an opinion. Canadians are getting poorer while well-connected Liberal insiders are getting richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716908">I rise again to speak about the government's refusal to comply with an order of the House to deliver unredacted documents to the RCMP related to the $400 million that Liberal insiders misappropriated and, in a staggering number of cases, voted to give money to themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716909"> It is true that while we are debating Liberal corruption, we are not moving forward on solutions for Canadians like axing the tax, building the homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime. If the government continues to insist on acting in contempt of Parliament by ignoring a vote of Parliament, there can be no other business of Parliament. It is a matter of basic democratic accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716910"> Therefore, I continue to demand that the government comply with the order of Parliament and release the documents. If it will not do so, it should call an election. That way Canadians can decide whether these documents should be released and whether they should choose a common-sense Conservative government to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Until then, we continue to debate this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716911">We need not look any further on the government's agenda, or lack thereof, about the business proposed if we suddenly allow them to get away without tabling the documents and shuffle the problem off to a committee to languish there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716912"> One of the things that they had planned in their legislative calendar was to introduce a motion, not a bill but a motion, to further implement their long-announced but not actually legislated capital gains tax increase. We have had expert testimony at the finance committee, witness after witness, who have said all this tax would do is drive away investment, kill jobs, stifle innovation and further reduce productivity. It would not actually result in further revenue for the government because it would suppress Canadian GDP and reduce income taxes collected by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716913"> Every day the NDP-Liberal government is unable to implement this tax is a good day. It is a good day for Canadian workers, a good day for Canadian entrepreneurs, a good day for Canadian investors and a good day for Canadians who rely on the services supplied by Canadian governments and who rely on the tax base and an increasingly productive economy rather than the one that is shrinking per capita under the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716914">We heard testimony thoroughly debunk the government's claim that this tax would only affect 0.13% of the population. We heard expert testimony that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of small businesses would be adversely affected. We heard expert testimony at the finance committee confirming that the tax the Liberals want to propose would kill 400,000 jobs. We heard expert testimony that the tax would reduce Canadian GDP by $90 billion. How much tax revenue do they lose in suppressing $90 billion of economic activity?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716915">We are not interested in allowing the government to simply move on and not disclose the documents that have been voted on, the production order, which was supported by the House of Commons, move on to the rest of its so-called agenda. We have watched as the middle-class aspiration of home ownership has come to an end under the government. We have watched how rents and mortgage payments have more than doubled. Under the government's watch, we have seen how tent cities have proliferated every major city and town. Therefore, the government has had over nine years to deal with Canada's problems, and it has only made things worse.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716916">We are going to keep debating the motion until the government releases the documents to account for the $400 million that the government's friends squandered and gave to themselves. We know that the government will not fix the budget. We know that Liberal insiders voted to give money to their own companies right under the nose of the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716917"> Navdeep Bains went out of his way to appoint a new board of insiders, and then he sent his own senior staff to be present in the room when they voted to give themselves money.

We heard testimony at the public accounts committee yesterday, excuse-making by officials who did not know that this was happening right under their noses. It is nonsense. These were concrete choices and decisions made by the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716923"> Madam Speaker, today marks 1,000 days since Russia began its further invasion of Ukraine. This is much longer than the three days Vladimir Putin thought it would take, but frankly it is 1,000 days too long. It should have never happened, and it would not have happened if the world had stood up to Russia when it invaded Georgia or when it invaded Ukraine in 2014. It would not have lasted this long if the world had provided Ukraine with the aid it needs to win the war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716924">Our government has said that Canada will stand with the Ukrainian people until they win and that victory is the only option. Victory is the only option because Ukraine's victory is essential to Canada's security. If Russia wins, it will not stop at Ukraine, and we know that because Vladimir Putin has told us so. If Russia wins, Canadians will be next in defending ourselves against Russian aggression, whether that is in Europe, in the Canadian Arctic or somewhere else.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8716973">She is right. The Liberal minister falsely claimed indigenous identity. His company received government contracts using that stolen identity, apparently while consorting with cocaine dealers, and all while he was a sitting minister of the Crown. What kind of message is the government sending by allowing him to sit in cabinet? As Jody Wilson-Raybould said today, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is making a mockery of reconciliation and enabling “white people play[ing] ancestry wheel of fortune.” The fraudulent <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> must resign, or the Prime Minister must fire him.</ParaText>

For 28 years, Barbara has served in some way, shape or form with Samaritan House. Originally joining the organization in 1989 as a women's counsellor and coordinator, Barbara worked to support women and children escaping domestic violence. Over the years, she continued to serve in a variety of ways, ultimately becoming the executive director in 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8716981">Under Barbara's guidance, Samaritan House grew to meet the rising needs of our community, from providing thousands of food hampers to offering critical services that empower individuals to have independence and hope. As Barbara steps into her well-earned retirement, her legacy of compassion and community advocacy is an inspiration to many. I am thankful to Barbara for her remarkable service. I send her my best wishes for rest, joy and new adventures in this next chapter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8717342">Madam Speaker, the member is absolutely right. The $400 million was misallocated by Liberal insiders, who were deliberately appointed by the previous minister. The misappropriation of that money could have gone to any of a number of things, including housing our troops. There is a base housing problem, in which our men and women in the armed forces do not have access to housing. That is just one thing that instantly leaps out at me because we have debated that in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717343">The member is right. The Liberals could have lowered taxes by $400 million. They could have not incurred another $400 million in debt.

              <ParaText id="8717357"> Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise, as always, on behalf of the good people of Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry in my part of eastern Ontario. Here we are, nearing the two-month mark of the Liberals' refusal to adhere to what they told Canadians when they came in nine long years ago: that they were going to be sunny ways. The number one line I remember them saying was “open by default”. They were going to be the most open and transparent government Canadians have ever seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717358">After nine years, here we are. Rather than the Liberals' listening to the will, the vote, the majority vote of the House of Commons, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has found them in contempt for refusing to turn over all the documents in their latest spending and corruption scandal. As I have said a few times here now, and as Canadians see this go on and on, it makes one wonder about a stubbornness, a refusal to just be open by default and to provide the RCMP with full, unredacted access to the documents so it can continue and complete a full criminal investigation into this specific case of insiders' getting ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717359">It makes one wonder what exactly is in the documents that the Liberals are refusing to provide, that they are redacting and that they do not want the RCMP to see. The facts are simple. If there is nothing to hide, as they claim; if they want to be fully co-operative; if they want Canadians to be assured that the RCMP cannot be stonewalled; and if they do not want to act as gatekeepers to information, documents and evidence of their own corruption and spending scandal, they would be open by default as they promised and just provide the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717360">It is incredible that a government is, here in the House of Commons, refusing to do so. As a consequence of that, it has been nearly two months now, 25 or 26 House days of the parliamentary calendar at least. We lose track. That is how long it has been that the Liberals do not care about their government business and their government agenda. Private member's bills are not advancing. It just makes one wonder how desperate they are to drag the issue out and avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717361">What we and Canadians do know from the Auditor General and her multiple reports into this issue is that there is a massive amount of corrupt, inappropriate behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717362">Think about going back a generation. When I first started getting interested in following federal politics, when I was a little political junkie in my teen years in the early 2000s, there was the sponsorship scandal. Think of where we are at now. The definition of insanity, and we have heard the expression before, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. This is what happens when we elect Liberals. It was 20 years ago that the sponsorship scandal came up; it was $40 million, not an insignificant amount of taxpayers' money back then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717363">What happened? There had to be a public inquiry. People went to jail for criminal intent, for stealing taxpayers' money and for Liberal insiders' getting ahead. It was one of the main reasons the Liberal Party of Canada in 2006 was defeated and the Conservative government came in with the accountability act to clean up the unethical mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717364">The accountability act was a cornerstone of the Harper Conservative government that was necessary after 13 years of Liberals in office. Here we are; fast-forward to now, at $400 million, 10 times the size, which has been confirmed by the Auditor General. Over $50 million in ineligible projects was awarded by Liberal insiders to each other in the green slush fund. There were 186 cases of conflict of interest. That is not an accident. It is not that they did not know the rules; it is blatant corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717365"> I have explained before that I served in municipal politics. I enjoyed my 12 years in my hometown of North Dundas serving as a councillor, as a mayor and then as a warden.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8717366">The number one thing when it comes to governance of a municipality, a charity, a board of directors or anything is learning about conflicts of interest. We call them pecuniary interests as well. People cannot advance their own personal agenda and financial benefit on the board that they serve. They have to declare a conflict and step away. They cannot put themselves in those situations to benefit themselves. It is Ethical Behaviour 101 and Board Governance 101, particularly in a fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717367"> For the SDTC fund, the program has existed for nearly a quarter century. It was not until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his then minister of industry started changing the players and appointing Liberal insiders that problems started. Here we are. Let us talk about being frustrated. Canadians are frustrated. The House of Commons is extremely frustrated because the Liberals refuse to take seriously the magnitude and level of corruption and bad behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717368"> Here are some examples: Not only has the House been paralyzed for the last two months, because the government has refused to provide the documents, but there is also the other part of it. Let us take a look at that. There have been several committees. I am looking at my colleague in front of me, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278577" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation>. He is on a few different committees, and he asks a few different questions and does a lot of digging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717369">Since this came out about the green slush fund, we have repeatedly asked officials about the $400 million in inappropriate payments, where there were conflicts of interest into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and about the projects that were not eligible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717370"> How many dollars, since the Auditor General's first report and second report, have come back to the federal Treasury so far? Not a dollar, not a penny has come back. The Auditor General was very clear. Projects were ineligible, and there were conflicts of interest in 186 cases. Everybody in the House and in this country knows that when there are 186 conflict of interest cases, it is not an accident. It is not, “Whoops, we didn't know.” The Liberals knew exactly what they were doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717371"> Here we are, years after brave whistle-blowers came forward and broke the news. They could not take the blatant corruption and inappropriate behaviour coming from these Liberal-appointed insiders anymore. It was almost an incestuous thing of giving money to each other, left, right and centre. Whistle-blowers came forward, and we have gone on from there. What has to happen at the end of the day is that we need the RCMP to get full access to these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717372">I mentioned the sponsorship scandal before, and a history and a record after nine years. The sponsorship scandal was the story and the issue that brought down the last Liberal government, and it is just going to be the continued stacking that will make the sponsorship scandal look like pocket change in comparison, when things are added up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717373">Let us think about it. There was the $60-million ArriveCAN program. Experts said it could have been done for about a quarter of a million dollars, or $80,000, in one weekend. However, $60 million later, it went to one company, a couple of people working in somebody's basement here in Ottawa. They had millions of dollars funnelled to them in sole-source contracts. They had nice little whiskey tastings and parties. It was all about who they knew. They did little to no work for any of it. How much of that has been returned? Nothing has been returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717374">We have the WE Charity scandal and what happened there during COVID. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family was benefiting. The Liberals tried to give the WE Charity, friends of the Prime Minister, hundreds of millions of dollars in the name of helping young people get employed and be connected with jobs. Once again, it was an absolute farce and a scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717375"> When it comes to the production of documents, there is the waste, the corruption and the inappropriate use of taxpayers' money. The list of many of those examples from over the last nine years goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717376">What we have when it comes to document production, which is at the heart of this matter, is that Parliament has voted and said that Parliament reigns supreme; it has the right to ask for and order the production of documents. That is what we did. Again, what do we do it for and why do we do it? It is because we want the RCMP to have unfettered access to all the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717377"> Here is the interesting thing: To know why it is so important, we have to look back at the behaviour of the Liberal government.</ParaText>

The RCMP said the case was closed, it was not proceeding and there were no charges. Why? The Prime Minister blocked access to cabinet documents, which were at the heart of the scandal. The RCMP said it closed the case and it did not proceed with the possibility, because it did not have all the information it needed or wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717379">It goes on. During the Winnipeg lab documents scandal in the midst of COVID, we had to call someone to the bar here. This was a very rare use of discipline in the House of Commons because the Liberals refused to provide the documents about how they allowed such a national security breach at the Winnipeg labs in a time of crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717380">I already mentioned the WE Charity scandal. Now we have another question of privilege with the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>. I have to be so careful here. He faked being indigenous, but I do not know if we can say that or not. He pretended to be indigenous. We are playing word salad in the House of Commons today about what we can and cannot say about some of the most preposterous, shameful behaviour from the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages, the member for Edmonton Centre, who is the first person to lecture anybody about their morals and integrity. Holy mackerel, that man has confidence to stand and lecture anybody. The look of the Liberal members behind him showed they are utterly ashamed at the number of examples of unethical behaviour. This is another example in nine years of unethical behaviour, of not following the will of committee and of this Parliament, and of obstructing the truth and access to information for Canadians to get to the bottom of all of these Liberal scandals. It goes on and on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717381">I see my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> here. He and I have a good time at the procedure and House affairs committee. Let us talk about blocking the production of documents. Here we are today at the PROC committee trying to get to another question of privilege. Liberals want to send it to committee so they can bury it under the rug. Now we have a question of privilege referred to PROC about members from all parties who had cyber attacks by the People's Republic of China and foreign interference by nefarious actors who were attacking members of Parliament and their personal email accounts. As we were talking about motions and how to move forward on the issue, we casually found out that the Communications Security Establishment, the CSE, said that it was not going to come back to committee because it has given us everything we need. Also, it has a substantial number of documents left, and is not sure it is going to give them to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717382">The document production order deadline of the House was in the middle of August. The CSE ignored that. It started dropping documents in September and quietly dropped about seven more sets of documents, then only said today, months after the deadline and months after it came back to answer questions at committee so that could try to wrap up and come to some conclusions, “By the way, there is a substantial trove of additional documents that we have not given yet. We will let the committee know by the end of the week when we might be able to give a timeline for that.” That is how seriously the Liberals take document production. They talk about accountability and open by default. They said two months and then they shut down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717383">The Liberals want to move this to committee and sweep it under the rug. I would say to any Canadian, just watch what happened today at PROC. It is exactly what they did on a very similar question of privilege. The House of Commons and the committee ordered the production of documents. It set a deadline of mid-August to provide all of them. They did not. We only learned today, months and months after the deadline, that there are a bunch more coming, but the Liberals are going to redact them and they said that they are not sure what they are going to give us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717384">Now the Liberals want to us trust them. They say, “just take this issue on this $400-million green slush fund.” They have provided all the documents they think the RCMP should have and they redacted what they think should be redacted. They have lost the trust of Canadians. They have lost the right to pretend to have any sort of maturity, trust or judgment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8717385">This is like somebody being in a courtroom accused of a crime and getting to decide what information the jury sees. People laugh; they shake their heads. However, this is exactly what is happening here, and let us be clear that the behaviour the RCMP has been asked to look at for criminal intent in its criminal investigation, which it said is open and ongoing, by the way, is the government's behaviour. That is absolutely right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717386">If we look at the history and conduct of the Liberals for the last nine years, Canadians do not trust them, so the House of Commons has stepped in, which it has the absolute right to do, and said to provide all the documents, unredacted, to the RCMP. It can take a look at them and make a determination. Only then will Canadians know justice. Once we know that all the documents have been given, with full access, not what the government wants to give and not what is unredacted, Canadians may start to feel like justice is being done in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717387"> A full investigation must be done into criminal intent. Why? It is because of the corruption, the insiders being put ahead of others, the 186 cases of conflict of interest and the $50 million in projects that were ineligible. For a country that had money growing on trees, that still would not be appropriate, but here we are now with massive, endless deficits in this country, and food bank use at a record high of two million visits every month. Housing costs have doubled and our immigration system is in shambles. People are finding it harder than ever before to make ends meet and to have a bit of money left over at the end of the day for Christmas presents. Homelessness and tent encampments, now in the thousands, have exploded in this country. Canadians are worse off undoubtedly after the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717388">All that ache, all that pain and all the strain that millions of Canadians are under already is simply from the government's inflationary policies. They have doubled the national debt, caused a 40-year high in inflation and caused record high rent, mortgages, housing costs and down payments. Canadians anywhere in this country are hurting, struggling under the weight of the record of the Liberal-NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717389">We saw the Liberals take $400 million of money sent by Canadians to Ottawa, but not to help get people food on their own tables without needing to go to a food bank, not to address the crisis of health care lineups or the mental health and addictions crisis this country is facing, and not to address housing. This $400 million went to Liberal insider friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717390">We saw this at some companies, including the very company the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> worked for. They got board appointments and gave themselves money in all these conflict of interest cases, and then saw the value of their companies increase by tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, putting themselves ahead. Canadians are frustrated by what has happened under the Liberals' record and by the cost of living they face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717391">When Canadians see the books, the finances and how little regard the Liberals have for taxpayers' money, instead putting Liberal insiders first, they are disgusted by it and ashamed of the conduct of their government. They are already hurting, and it is another jab, another kick. When Canadians were already down, the Liberals casually blew $400 million. The Auditor General's first report, the Auditor General's second report and many committees, over and over again, have demanded accountability and demanded that this money, which never should have gone out the door in the first place, come back. It is years later and multiple whistle-blowers later. We have been talking about this for nearly two months in the House of Commons and not a single dollar has even come back yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717392">I am proud to stand on behalf of the people of Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry to say to the Liberals to be open by default, as they promised to Canadians nine years ago, and give all the documents, unredacted, to the RCMP. It is time for accountability. It is time to put trust not in the Liberals, but in law enforcement in this country to look into their conduct.</ParaText>

It is no wonder that a growing majority of Canadians no longer trust the Liberals and are champing at the bit to throw them out of office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717428">I had to laugh the other week. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation</Affiliation> is the same minister who was in charge of overseeing Sustainable Development Technology Canada, also known as SDTC, this green slush fund that we are going to keep talking about. He is a nice guy, but he said the other week that the question being asked on every street corner in Canada is why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> will not get his security clearance. That just shows how out of touch with Canadians the government is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717429">It tells me that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has not even ventured very far beyond Wellington Street in recent months. I can tell him that this is not the question Canadians are asking. They are not asking that of me in my riding, and I am talking to my constituents. Do members want to know what I hear every single day, often multiple times a day? I am asked when we can get rid of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. People say we need to get rid of him; we need to get rid of the corrupt Liberals who are destroying our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717430">It does not matter if I am at a community event, a high school, a farm, a church event or even at Remembrance Day events. I have had the opportunity, as I am sure all of my colleagues have, to attend those Remembrance Day services during our constituency week. It is always a privilege to participate, particularly to meet our veterans and their family members. However, it is always the same. Even at Remembrance Day events, the question is the same: How and when are we getting rid of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? The Liberals are destroying the Canada people knew, loved and fought for. It is a sad indictment of the failed government and its radical, woke policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717431">On the other hand, Canadians like our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>. There is a reason for that. The difference is that the Leader of the Opposition is listening to Canadians. He is not lecturing. We can watch the Leader of the Opposition at a rally or an event with staff. He will stand there, sometimes for hours, and meet every single person. He will take the time to talk to them, to ask them about themselves and their concerns. He takes the time to listen to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717432">I have seen the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> go for three-plus hours at events. He is not telling people what to think, to feel or to believe. He is not talking down to them or going after them if they say something that he disagrees with. He is actually listening to Canadians. He is listening to their concerns and offering up common-sense solutions. Canadians are common-sense people, and they trust him and our great team over on this side of the House, Canada's common-sense Conservatives, to fix the problems that the government has created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717433">Trust is a big deal. Once that is broken, it is awfully hard to win it back. When someone breaks trust, when they get caught often enough, as the Liberals have, it is broken. When the people cannot trust the government, that spells disaster for a country. In a democracy where the government does not trust the people, that is equally disastrous. The current government does not trust the people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8717434"> It refuses to trust them with the truth. It refuses to listen to the growing majority of Canadians who are begging for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to step down, to give them the election they are asking for, a carbon tax election, a referendum on its disastrous record. Speaking of disaster, the government has often been compared to the <I>Titanic</I>, particularly when it comes to shuffling some of these failed ministers. The ship is plowing straight ahead toward an iceberg, another scandal. Rather than switch course, the Prime Minister is busy rearranging the deck chairs. This combination did not work for the <I>Titanic</I> and it is not going to work here either. However, he continues on with that. He shuffles the chairs. He sees a minister failing in one or two portfolios and he promotes them to a third.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717435">I think there is a secondary way we could look at this comparison, particularly in relation to an iceberg being a scandal, including the scandal of SDTC. When we see an iceberg, 90% of it is under water; it is hidden from view. That is often how scandals work. We only see 10%. We only see a sliver, and there is an indication there is something going on here. Something does not feel right. Something is amiss here, but it is only 10% of the real scandal. There is 90% hidden from view. They want to keep talking about this motion because they want to keep covering it up. They refuse to hand over the documents. It begs the question: what else are they hiding? What else is that 90% that we have not even discovered?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717436">It is dangerous to Canadians, but it is far more dangerous to the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to shed light onto that. The sad part is that these Liberals are desperately trying to cover up their latest scandal to protect the Prime Minister who is not worth the cost, the chaos or the corruption. Canadians are hurting and they are afraid. Like I said, I go home every weekend so I can connect with and hear from my constituents. A lot of folks cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves in Canada. Many of these folks have good jobs, and some of them have more than one job. They work hard, they work long hours, but they still cannot afford the skyrocketing cost of living under the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717437">The government has borrowed, printed and spent money so recklessly as to double the size of our national debt. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has spent more money than every other prime minister and government in our history combined. They are addicted to spending. There are solutions for people who are addicted and that is to get addictions counselling. I think that is what the government needs. As a result of this addiction, everyday Canadians are forced to make sacrifices and they are getting tired of doing it. They are sick of the corruption they see happening here in Ottawa. They are sick of the government having its hand in its pocket. They are sick of being told what to think, feel and believe. They are sick of the arrogant, “I-know-better-than-everyone” attitude that pervades the Liberal government. They are fed up with seeing their hard-earned money that should be going to feed their kids, fix the house, maybe go into a savings account for a rainy day, go into the pockets of wealthy and well-connected Liberals, like what has happened at SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717438">Here, on the opposition benches, at least Conservatives are saying that we understand, we hear them, we agree. We are standing up for Canadians and their interests in Ottawa. We are here trying to hold the government accountable for the money it has stolen. Yes, I mean stolen. It has stolen it from the taxpayer. SDTC, this green slush fund, where Liberals took taxpayer dollars and gave them to their own companies, that is theft. ArriveCAN was theft. The government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> need to be held accountable. To what extent they must be held accountable we will not know until we actually see the full damage, until we see the documents and until Canadians know what was happening with that 90% under the water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717439">As I mentioned earlier, the sad reality is we sit here debating what is really undebatable. The folks at SDTC took nearly $400 million of taxpayer dollars and gave it to themselves. That is indefensible. The sad reality is, while we are here debating this, there are other important issues we are not able to address. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8717440">The government's failure to be transparent has bogged us down in process for weeks now. All the Liberals need to do for the House to continue with the good work that it should be doing is come clean and present the documents unredacted, as they have been been requested to do by the Speaker of the House. Then we can all get back to important issues. However, they will not do that. They refuse. They are way more concerned with their own plight than that of the people they are supposed to be serving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717441">I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the issues that folks in my riding of Provencher are bringing to me, who tell me what could have been done with the $400 million. I have already mentioned some of the scandals, the Liberal corruption and the desire for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to finally take a hint and resign. I have also mentioned some of the major issues for my people. I think for the country it is about the cost of living, but here are a few more issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717442">The abuses heaped by governments at all levels on citizens during COVID still remain a major issue in my riding. Restrictions and vaccine mandates damaged the social fabric of our communities and a generation of young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717443">Two years ago, when we were debating Bill <Document DbId="11879403" Type="4">C-293</Document> in the House, I raised the troubling reality that some 51,714 documented Canadians had suffered vaccine injuries as a result of their COVID shots. At the time, I reported, based on the numbers available on the government's website, that 10,501 people had suffered severe reactions, including 874 anaphylactic reactions, 1,342 cases of myocarditis, 104 thrombosis cases and 382 reports that had an outcome of death. I also shared that despite all of that, the government's vaccine injury support program had paid out a mere eight claims. Many Canadians do not know this, but the government does have a vaccine injury support program. It is called VISP. It can be found on the Government of Canada's website.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717444">That was in November 2022. Two years later, in November 2024, where we are today, the number of injuries has risen to 58,712, with 488 reported deaths. After two years, do colleagues know how many claims have been approved? After thousands of injuries and thousands of claims, a mere 183 claims have been approved. There is still a question as to whether compensation has actually been issued. The truly bizarre thing is that back in April, the government added another $36 million to the existing $75 million it had allocated to the vaccine injury support program. Why are folks not getting their money? The folks over at SDTC seemed to have had no problem disbursing nearly $400 million in fairly quick order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717445">These injured folks did what the government told them to do. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and all of his ministers looked down the lens of a camera and told Canadians to get these shots, that they were safe and effective. Every day, we heard from the Prime Minister. Every day he came out and told Canadians to get the shot; it would prevent them from getting sick. That did not work. It was supposed to prevent them from transmitting COVID to somebody else. That did not work. It was supposed to prevent them from going to the hospital. That did not work. It was supposed to prevent them from being in the ICU. That did not work. It was supposed to prevent them from dying. It did not prevent that either. In fact, the greatest number of deaths from COVID occurred among those who had been triple vaccinated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8717449">Madam Speaker, the member asks a very interesting question. I wish he had listened to what I was saying, because he would understand the relevance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717450">The relevance was the misinformation and the disinformation provided by the Liberal government, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to Canadians about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. There have been vaccine injury support program claims made by Canadians who have had negative experiences, and I hear from many of them in my constituency office and in my Hill office. Those claims are not being approved in a judicious manner, and they are not being paid out as they should be. That is the whole point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717451">SDTC officials had no problem getting $400 million out the door, but the over $100 million that has been earmarked for vaccine injuries seems to be lagging significantly. That is my point: The money is not getting out the door. It seemed to get out the door somehow for Liberal insiders but not for people who did what the government asked them to do and suffered negative consequences for it. Those people are not getting reimbursed, and they should be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717452">In fact, what people are being offered instead of cash is MAID, and that is so incredibly sad. I heard stories from vaccine-injured people who, because of being so frustrated with their injuries and the failure to be recognized for the hardships they have gone through, have been offered MAID. Some have actually participated in that program. That is incredibly sad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717453">The message I bring to the government from my constituents is to just butt out, provide the basic services government is supposed to provide and then back off and let people live their lives. My constituents want the government to axe the tax, stop the reckless deficit spending, stop the alarmist anti-energy crusade and embrace responsible resource development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717454">Under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canada is going through the worst decline in our living standards in 40 years, the worst drop in income per person in the G7 and the worst economic growth in the OECD. However, the Prime Minister and his radical, woke <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> just keep making things worse by attacking Canadian energy and energy workers. Their latest scheme is what they claim is an emissions cap. It is not really an emissions cap. This is not a cap on emissions; it is a cap on responsible Canadian oil production. It is a cap on jobs, on paycheques and on prosperity for Canada. Let us label it for what it is rather than as a cap on emissions: The Liberal government wants to cap Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717455">The government's own analysis admits that the cap is going to cost Canada billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. We would think its members learned their lesson from previous failures in attacking the energy sector; they have missed every single climate target with their carbon tax, and all they have done is make people exponentially poorer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717456">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> refuse to accept that Canada's energy sector is the country's single-largest private sector investor in clean technology. Canadian oil and gas is the best in the world. The sector has a clear record of reducing emissions and adhering to the highest standards of environmental protection, not to mention that, in 2022, the oil and gas industry provided $45 billion in revenue to Canadian governments, funding schools, hospitals, roads and other crucial public infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717457">Instead of celebrating this and working with Canada's energy workers to tackle environmental issues, Liberals want to crush the energy sector, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk at the worst time possible. This ideological crusade against Canadian energy must end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717458">We could be working to fix the budget. We could be working on common-sense energy policies to get Canada's economy booming again. However, we are stuck here instead, talking about another Liberal scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717459">A big one is immigration, which is a significant concern in my riding. My office does a lot of work on immigration files. We help hundreds, if not thousands, of people a year, both Canadians and those seeking to become Canadians. However, our immigration system is broken. It is out of control. The government finally admitted that a couple of weeks ago; I believe it did so again just recently. Its radical, reckless and uncontrolled immigration policies are partly to blame for joblessness, the housing crisis and the health care crisis Canadians are facing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717460">The Liberals increased population growth by over 200% in the last several years. They did it without ensuring adequate housing, health care or available jobs for newcomers. The government also failed spectacularly to ensure that those flooding into the country were given proper background checks. To add insult to injury, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> called Canadians racists if they questioned his reckless policy. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8717461">I can say on behalf of the incredibly diverse group of people, including newcomers, that my office has helped and those who have lived here for years that it is not racist to ask why the government is bringing upwards of one million new people each year when there are not even enough homes for Canadians, including many new Canadians who are already here. It is not racist to question the wisdom of bringing in more people who will cause additional strain on an already untenable health care system and social safety net when Canadians are unable to access those programs and forced to wait unacceptably long periods to receive services that they have paid for with their tax dollars. The government's failures on immigration are almost too many to chronicle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717462">With that, there have been discussions among the parties and if you seek it, I am confident you will find unanimous consent to see the clock at 7:32 p.m.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8717466"> Madam Speaker, on November 8, I raised a question regarding newly unredacted briefing notes. To be fair, they are still only partially unredacted. There is plenty still hidden, but they are less redacted than previously. They are notes provided by Correctional Service Canada officials to the minister from 2015 to 2019. They were originally sought in 2019. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717467">The government managed to delay their release by fighting the efforts to have them made public by a very persistent journalist, but after five years, we have the notes. They indicate, which is the point I made on November 8, that Correctional Service Canada recommended against reopening the Joyceville and Collins Bay prison farms, which had been shut in 2010 because the labour done by inmates on the farms would not reduce recidivism but would waste resources, meaning they would cost a great deal of money, and would lead to worse public safety outcomes than a number of alternatives, which were available and recommended by Correctional Service Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717468">I asked that question, and the response of the <Affiliation DbId="311622" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> was to say the community supports prison farms. In all fairness, I cannot figure out who he was talking about when he says the community supports the continuation of the prison farms. There is a separate issue with regard to the potential opening of the abattoir that the Liberals shut down about a year or year and a half ago that I think does have community support. There are some practical issues making it difficult for that to go forward. The facility is probably not capable of being rehabilitated, but there is support for that because beef farmers have a serious problem finding an outlet for their beef. Slaughter facilities are in very limited supply in eastern Ontario. That is not the prison farm we are talking about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717469">The prison farm is a mixed goat and cow dairy operation involving a multi-million dollar, largely robotic cow milking system for which the government has not acquired milk quota yet, which will cost further millions of dollars. It will be manned and observed by people from McGill University. None of this has anything to do with community support, so I wanted to get that on the record. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717470">The assertion here is that everything the government does, so it claims, is evidence-based and science-based, that it looks to the experts and takes their word on things, but the fact is there is a very different story. The documents reveal that CSC indicated in its briefing notes, “Adapting an employment program that targets the care of farm animals such as cows, would be highly unlikely to produce significant recidivism reduction, even if the risk-need-responsivity principles of effective corrections can be applied to this type of intervention.” There is a lot of emphasis on people getting more humane skills. It specifically mentions that pet therapies are unlikely to produce results and have never been done with farm animals before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717471">Based on that, I ask why the government is not listening to the advice that has been given over and over again by Correctional Service Canada not to reopen the prison farms.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8717472">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to the many benefits provided by Correctional Service Canada's penitentiary agricultural program. The government remains committed to the implementation of evidence-based policy informed by experts that contributes to offender rehabilitation and safer communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717473">In response to the question from the member for Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston, I will say that the Government of Canada consulted widely about whether to reinstate the penitentiary agriculture program. In 2016, Correctional Service launched a feasibility study, which included community consultations, an online forum and a public town hall that featured the participation of more than 6,000 people. The majority of participants in both consultations said that they wished to bring back the penitentiary agriculture program, noting the positive impact on employment opportunities for offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717474"> Since 2017, Correctional Service has engaged a number of internal and external stakeholders, including community organizations, to identify opportunities in the penitentiary farm program to represent a variety of types of agriculture activities during the offender employment training, and this includes the expertise of the prison farm advisory panel. The panel works to bring together agricultural and farming leaders to provide informed recommendations and program ideas on how we can better protect our communities through offender rehabilitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717475">The government will continue to work to protect the safety and security of our employees while also promoting the safety and security of our communities through evidence-backed rehabilitative programming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717476">I am proud to highlight that through the programming provided at the farms, Correctional Service is recognized as an international leader in the development and delivery of correctional interventions. Since their reopening in 2018, the penitentiary agriculture programs at Joyceville and Collins Bay institutions have provided on-the-job vocational training that relates to the agricultural industry, allowing federal inmates to gain employment skills that are also transferable to other industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717477"> Inmates at the farms perform activities like building and renovating necessary infrastructure and working to repair and rebuild farmland, in addition to crop production. These activities mirror the activities that take place in agricultural lands across the country that employ tens of thousands of people at any given time. One of the ways that Correctional Service works to provide safer communities from coast to coast to coast is through the provision of these employment programs, which build essential skills that will assist offenders in finding employment in the community after their release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717478">There have been several research documents dating back almost a decade that have noted a connection between employment and positive reintegration results. For example, inmates who participate in the CORCAN employment program while incarcerated are more likely to get a job in the community. Offenders under community supervision who find employment in the community have reduced recidivism rates. Inmates who participate in the CORCAN employment program while incarcerated are more likely to be granted parole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717479">Furthermore, all revenues generated through the penitentiary agriculture programs are reinvested in the offender employment and employability program, allowing for further programming to aid in offender reintegration.</ParaText>

Research dating back to 2014 has noted a direct connection between employment and positive reintegration results upon release. In addition to building safer communities by working to provide offenders with skill sets to find employment, community programming, such as the penitentiary agriculture program, works to save Canadians money.

              <ParaText id="8717487"> Madam Speaker, I am back tonight to continue calling on the Liberal government to get serious about the climate crisis, specifically with respect to investing in public transit, which it could do by taxing the excess profits being made by the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717488"> This is particularly timely because this very specific call could be included in the government's fall economic statement, whenever that comes out over the coming weeks. It is one of the reasons why this is one of six calls I have been making to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> over the last number of weeks. The stakes, in my view, really could not be higher when it comes to the climate crisis that we are in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717489">First of all, we need to recognize that we are the only G7 country whose emissions have gone up since 1990. This is at a time when we have already reached about 1.3°C of warming compared to pre-industrial times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717490"> Back at the 2015 Paris climate conference, world leaders all agreed we would do everything possible to limit the increase to 1.5°C. They did this because climate scientists have told us, if we cross that threshold, it will lead to “leading to devastating and potentially irreversible consequences for several vital Earth systems that sustain a hospitable planet.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717491">What are we on track for? As of now, current pledges by countries around the world put us somewhere between 2.6°C and 3.1°C in global average temperature rise. We must do so much more as a country to do our fair share, to lead and to demonstrate what is possible when it comes to acting on the climate crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717492"> At the same time, when it comes to proven climate solutions, such as public transit, there will be no new funding until 2026. That is after the next election. There is funding available, but operations, like a mechanic who needs to fix a bus, is not eligible. The funding being provided is pretty much the status quo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717493"> However, at the same time, for proven climate distractions, such as carbon capture and storage, we are rolling out the red carpet. The government is giving another tax credit in Bill <Document DbId="12739107" Type="3">C-59</Document>, which is between $7 billion to $16 billion, and most of the Canada growth fund, so there is $15 billion there. If someone wants to expand the pipeline, there is $34 billion for them to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717494"> Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry is making out like bandits. In 2022 alone, the five biggest oil and gas companies operating in this country made $38 billion, and that is after the $29 billion in dividends and share repurchases. They are doing it by gouging Canadians at the pumps to the tune of 18¢ a litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717495"> The solution should be pretty obvious. Number one, stop the subsidies. Number two, tax these excess profits by taking the Canada recovery dividend that was applied to banks and life insurance companies in the pandemic and apply it to oil and gas. Even for just 15% of profits over a billion, that would generate $4.2 billion a year, all of which could be put into proven solutions, such as public transit. They could add more funds, start the fund sooner or direct it towards operating funds. My question to the hon. parliamentary secretary is this: Will they do it?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8717496"> Madam Speaker, it is nice to be at adjournment debate with my friend and colleague from the Green Party and Kitchener Centre to discuss how we fight climate change, not just if we fight climate change, which is the conversation we always have with the Conservative Party because it wants to ignore the impacts of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717497"> I will say I was a bit struck by the fact that my friend did not mention that Canada is the first oil- and gas-producing nation to introduce an emissions cap on the oil and gas sector. This is an essential next step, yet we have Premier Danielle Smith spending $7 million of public money that could have been invested to hire new nurses and teachers in Alberta. Instead, she is actually doing equalization. She has hired a Quebec company to drive trucks around Ottawa with big screens on them that say, “scrap the cap”. Well, we will not scrap the cap because we believe in climate action. We believe that oil and gas companies, while essential, because we need energy and the world needs Canadian energy, should not be entitled to unlimited pollution. That is why we have stepped up to say they need to invest some of their $66 billion in profits last year into some climate action, efficiencies and making sure we do not have emissions-intensive barrels of oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717498">I would like to congratulate the region of Waterloo and the residents of Kitchener Centre because they have been the recipients of an extraordinary amount of public transit funding over the last couple of years. That is due in part to amazing advocacy from my friends and colleagues here from that region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717499">I have a couple of quotes to read. The first is from Mayor Berry Vrbanovic, who I have met a couple of times and is a very nice guy. He says that there is now a stable source of funds to help pay for the extension of a light-rail system from Kitchener into Cambridge, and that it is absolutely transformative. He is referring to the $30-billion investment that we recently made in public transit. It is the largest investment the federal government has ever made in public transit in Canada. That is extraordinary. However, I also have to congratulate Kitchener on being early winners in the public transit game. My colleague said there was no funding available until 2026. That is not true. Kitchener was recently awarded over $187 million through a $180-billion fund for public transit, green infrastructure and more social activities and infrastructure in various communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717500">We are funding the public transit system the residents of Kitchener Centre need and use regularly. As my colleague said, that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and reduces people's reliance on cars. That is a good thing. People will say, “but buses run on diesel.” Sometimes they do, but not the 11 fully electric vehicles the federal government purchased for the Grand River transit, GRT, system with $6 million through our public transit infrastructure stream. The Waterloo region is extremely well served by our plethora of public transit funding. The website of the region of Waterloo says that GRT is in “collaboration with the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo... thanks to $5 million total in federal and municipal project funding through the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund.” It is deploying 11 fully electric buses, which is fun. It is great.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717501">I am an electric vehicle enthusiast; I love seeing vehicles on the road that do not need to rely on fossil fuels. “Investing in modern and integrated networks of multi-use trails and pathways that connect to public transit are essential to building healthy and sustainable communities for all Canadians to live, work, and raise their families”. That is from one of my favourite members of Parliament, the hon. member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278307" Type="2">Waterloo</Affiliation>. We have worked together a lot. I want to congratulate her on the funding for her region and thank her for her advocacy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8717502">Madam Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is quite right that this government has made investments. In fact, I was at the announcement with respect to the electric buses he mentioned. What he needs to also realize is that advocates have been trying to tell this government that if it does not ensure that the funding it proposed also funds operations, we are not going to see the advances we need to increase service and reduce fares because the permanent public transit fund does not start until 2026. From Environmental Defence, for example, “A lack of public transit operating funding means buses don't show up on time, riders spend more time waiting, and fares continue to climb faster than inflation.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717503">Will the parliamentary secretary recognize what transit advocates have been calling for to ensure that we roll out the red carpet the way his government has already for carbon capture, where they have given tens of billions for climate distractions, and put that towards the public transit we need?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8717504"> Madam Speaker, these are really important issues, but I honestly think that my friend and colleague is conflating two issues. We are taking strong climate action, and we are holding big oil and gas companies to account. All of those big profits that I mentioned, and which he referenced as well, are taxed; they are funding these programs. It is important to recognize that we do travel on modes of transportation that require fossil fuels and that the world needs Canada's energy. We have to make sure that it is green, clean, innovative and efficient. That is what we are doing with the first-ever cap on emissions. Again, I am surprised that my friend and colleague refuses to acknowledge that the government has taken really strong action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8717505">We talked earlier today. I mentioned to him that the city of Burlington has made transit free for seniors, kids under 12 and teens. Burlington is a small part of the riding of Milton, not geographically, but from the perspective of population. It has done that with help from our government, with support for these initiatives. I know that the region of Waterloo has that same support. I congratulate those in the region, and I thank the member for his advocacy again.</ParaText>
