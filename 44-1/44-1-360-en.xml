              <ParaText id="8646565"> Mr. Speaker, I am privileged, yet saddened, to rise to honour my former boss, my mentor and my friend, Robert Sopuck. I thank all my colleagues for allowing me this opportunity to honour this great Canadian, the former member of Parliament for Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646566">Robert, or Bob as he was known by his many friends, passed away suddenly, but peacefully, last week in his home near Lake Audy, Manitoba. He is survived by his beloved wife, Caroline; two children, Tony, and his wife Lainee, and his daughter, Marsha, and husband Graham; three grandchildren, who he simply loved to teach about the outdoors, Eden, Senon and Esmee; by his sister, Joyce, and brother, Tim; by many nieces and nephews; and by so many other loved ones across the country who simply cherished Bob. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646567">I want to offer, on behalf of the Conservative Party, our appreciation to Bob's family for sharing him with us, particularly his beloved wife, who he often referred to so proudly as “the inestimable Caroline.” His love for her serves as an inspiration for all of us who have been lucky enough to witness it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646568">Today I hope to do justice to a great parliamentarian, and a great man, and I apologize in advance as I may get emotional. I have some family with us today. My wife and I were married, but we had our big wedding celebration on Saturday, and we were expecting Bob and Caroline to be with us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646569">Back in 2016, I was hired by Bob after a very robust interview process. I went to his office and we talked about life and politics for about two hours over a scotch. He cared about the person, not the résumé. Little did I know at that time the profound impact he would have on my life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646570">Bob was described by a newspaper he surely never read, the Toronto Star, as the “right-wing environmentalist”, which is actually a very good way to describe him. However, he was not an environmentalist, he was a conservationist. He believed that those who lived, worked and played on the land were our best conservationists and the true environmentalists. He recognized the value of modern agriculture, of ranching, of natural resource development and all of the rural communities that those industries supported. He was an avid outdoorsman, a true conservationist himself, and perhaps the strongest advocate that hunters, anglers and trappers in Canada have ever had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646571"> Bob was born to parents of eastern European descent and immigration, and while he was raised in the city, he spent his summers in Whiteshell, where he learned his love of the outdoors. He caught his first fish at the age of four with his father, which kicked off a life of outdoor pursuits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646572">Bob went on to receive an honours degree in science from the University of Manitoba, and then a Master of Fishery Science from an ivy league school, Cornell University, with a particular focus on rainbow trout. From there, he held a wide variety of careers in land, water and wildlife conservation. He worked as a fisheries biologist at both the provincial and federal levels before he decided he wanted to purchase a beautiful, sprawling piece of farmland near Lake Audy, just south of his beloved national park, Riding Mountain National Park, on which he built with his own hands a beautiful, secluded log home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646573">He spent a lot of time in the Arctic and did a lot of work there, focusing on Arctic char research, and had so many amazing stories. He had such respect for the people he had the chance to live with, the Inuit. He did some of the earliest environmental impact research on the long-proposed Mackenzie Valley pipeline, and I think one of his greatest regrets is that pipeline never came to fruition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646574">Bob was a farmer. He was a guide. He was an outfitter. He was the environmental adviser for the former premier of Manitoba, Gary Filmon. He went on to be the environmental director at the Pine Falls paper plant, improving water quality, quantitatively. He worked for Delta Waterfowl, and after retiring from this place, returned as a board member there. He did environmental monitoring in the oil sands. He understood policy, because his boots were on the ground. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646575">He often joked, when somebody would introduce him to do a speech, that it was reasonable to think “Can this guy not keep a job?”, but those jobs and those experiences formed his views on conservation and on natural resource development and the rural way of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646576"> I list this depth of careers because it highlights that he earned his stripes, which allowed him to be an incredible advocate and an even better member of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646577">Bob was a brilliant communicator, and he knew how important effective communications were, that words mattered. He was brilliant not because he was suave, some fast-talking salesman-type guy, but because he was authentic, honest, thoughtful, direct, articulate and had a heck of a vocabulary on him. He was wicked smart, and he always preferred to stand up for the little guy. He was not willing to lay down to the mobs, to the loud minority that wanted to shout down views like his at times. It was an inspiration when he so proudly and so frequently stood up and bluntly said what needed to be said. He had been doing it for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646578">Starting back in 2001, Bob wrote a regular column with the Winnipeg Free Press, in which he refused to shy away from issues like hunting and angling. Those essays beautifully articulated the spirituality and connection to family and nature that so many millions of Canadians enjoy today. He explained why so many of us felt that it was vital to protect the rights of those people and their ability to take part in those traditional heritage activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646579"> He went on to compile these essays into a wonderful book, <I>A Life Outdoors</I>, which, looking back while I was reading it last night, I think is an unintentional biography, from catching that first fish with his dad at four years old to his life as that avid outdoorsman. It is a wonderful book. I would encourage people to pick it up, particularly if they enjoy outdoor activities. It also has some phenomenal recipes for wild game, which I have tasted and are very good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646580">Bob had the chance to elevate those communication skills and decided to run for office back in 2010. He ran because he knew he had something to offer. He wanted to make a difference and to fight for what he believed in. That is what he did in this place every single day of his nine years as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646581"> Bob had an incredible understanding, which I was so lucky to have witnessed, of what this job was. The first was, obviously, to represent our local communities, to fight and advocate for them, and try to get things done for them. This is something that each and every one of us in the House works to do. The second was to do what was right for Canada, the big-picture country that has diverse views and many challenges at times, to fight for what was right and to fight with that same level of passion that he did for the communities he so proudly represented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646582">He knew his constituents. He knew their way of life, their values, their struggles, their challenges, their hopes, their dreams and their aspirations. He had the benefit that he had worked in politics in his early days with the Manitoba government, as had his wife, Caroline, which allowed him to be all the more effective. He knew when to be loud, when it made sense to pick a fight, and do it publicly, to try to move the needle on something. He also knew when it made more sense to keep it behind the scenes to try to quietly get things done. He knew to keep it on the ice, and that is why he was so respected and liked by colleagues from across party lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646583">Locally, he was so proud to have helped deliver funding to pave Highway 10 through Riding Mountain National Park. Anybody who knows the area or lives in area and commutes through it knows how important it is. Anyone who has the chance to visit that beautiful national park will be a benefactor of the work he did lobbying to get that done, as has anyone who benefited from funding through the recreational fisheries conservation partnership program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646584">That program was launched back in 2013 and supported fisheries habitat restoration projects led by recreational angling groups, fisheries groups and conservation groups. There are lakes across Canada where spawning habitat has been restored, aerators have been installed and anglers will reap the benefits today, tomorrow and for the years ahead. Just as Bob wanted, it was done with the people who care so much about the natural world, who will get in hip waders, get into the water and want to make meaningful impacts on our fishery stocks. He knew the best people were those who wanted to get things done, who not only wanted to talk about doing things but they put their money where their mouth was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646585">Through perseverance, persuasion and perhaps just sheer stubbornness, he was able to convince former Finance Minister Flaherty and Prime Minister Harper to enable this plan, and it is an ever-lasting legacy for the projects that it undertook. It would never have happened without Bob Sopuck. I would go so far as to argue that, single-handedly, Bob has saved more fish in our country than anyone else ever has.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646586"> Throughout his career, he was an effective and long-time member of the fisheries committee and loved every minute of it. I think his colleagues appreciated him there, too. That committee was always, and I think still is, rather cordial with many unanimous reports. He was also on the environment committee, which at times is a little less polite. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646587">Bob was a pit bull. Given his Ivy League education and his series of careers prior to being elected, not many people were going to best him at any topic at those two committees. That included the bureaucrats who I remember once telling Bob, whenever he was there, that they knew they had to be on their toes. He was so very proud of that. He just revelled in the opportunity to rip apart some pompous executive who thought they could get away with saying things that were not actual answers. He would fight to get the answers and he would run circles around them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646588">Now, I am a proud member of the environment committee, and the lessons I have learned could not be more clear. Some of those officials now know where I learned it from. I have to mention the Fisheries Act specifically, because Bob wrote a paper back in 2001 entitled “The Federalization of Prairie Freshwater”, which was the policy framework used by the Harper government when making important changes to the Fisheries Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646589">It was 10 years after he wrote it that the catalyst for those changes finally happened: it was overland flooding in Saskatchewan. At the Craven country jamboree, threatened due to excess rain, a campground was unable to be pumped because DFO declared there was water there now, so clearly fish could be there. There was habitat so we had to prevent it from being pumped. Normal person logic said that was not really fish habitat, it was a campground, but it was the definition of fish habitat in the act that was the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646590">Bob knew it and identified it years earlier. He went on to lead the charge drafting that legislation to make those important changes to stop ridiculous overreach from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans that had a real impact on rural Canadians and our prosperity. He understood that unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats had to be kept in check, that they did not understand our way of life, that he had to be involved in educating them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646591">Bob was the founder of our Conservative hunting and angling caucus with the help of his close friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278568" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation>. That member has carried the torch ever since. I know for a fact he will not only keep Bob's legacy alive, but he will be the steadfast advocate that community needs and will continue to work on their behalf. He is joined by so many of my Conservative colleagues, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278216" Type="2">North Okanagan—Shuswap</Affiliation>, who are dedicated to protecting these communities. There are so many more; they know who they are, and it is appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646592">There are millions of law-abiding firearms owners in this country, of hunters, of anglers, of people who contribute directly to enhancing our wildlife populations, and as Bob would always say, are the environment's best friends. We would not think communities like this necessarily need protecting, but, unfortunately, they do. For the most part, rural Canadians do not really care what happens in big cities. They just kind of want to be left alone, but for some reason, many of those radical environmental and animal rights activists living in their concrete jungles have a real keen interest in what happens on our private landscapes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646593">We need great MPs like my colleagues to continue to stand up for that now in his honour. I am proud to join those efforts and will continue to take part in any of those future fights. When I think back to some of the fights, he revelled in a good fight. One I remember he led the charge on, which was important, was Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document>. It was an animal rights bill that would transfer human rights to animals. What it was going to do was destroy modern agriculture, animal livestock agriculture. It was going to destroy hunting and angling in this community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646594">He led with help from across party lines, using those relationships he had built by being the guy he was, to kill that legislation. I remember when the RCMP decided to try to appease those animal rights activists and get rid of the iconic muskrat hat for Mounties, Bob was having none of that. He wanted to protect the livelihood of those trappers across the country and the warmth of our frontline police officers serving in our northern communities. He walked the walk and he was a true friend of the trapping community. Many of us may remember him strutting around here with a fur jacket, with his own muskrat hat and these big old skunk mitts. He was the real deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646595">Bob was always on the lookout for government overreach, or efforts that would impact the people he was sent here to represent, which is why he was great. He was not just about defending, he was vocal in supporting and promoting, proactively working to set the stage to communicate with the average person who otherwise might not think about these issues or even realize they cared about them. In many cases, these were urban audiences, like when he was writing for the Winnipeg Free Press.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646596">What might be less known is the impact he had on so many people, directly, personally, individually and, particularly, on young people. I think it is important to highlight the legacy that this leaves behind. Bob freely shared his wisdom and his wealth of knowledge with young people around him, understanding that it was not just about today, that it was about tomorrow. Anything he could do to nurture the next generation, he was willing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646597">He was a mentor to so many of us, to those who worked directly for him and to our friends he got to know, he would spend time with and to whom he would give, generously, of his time. We, each and every one of us, loved him. He gave so much time. He would answer questions candidly, provide advice when asked and sometimes when not asked. He would share his life experiences and those incredible stories that he had amassed over that wonderful life of his. He treated us like part of the team or the family, which is why I think he was referred to as Uncle Bob by so many people. He made us believe that we actually had something to contribute, that we mattered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646598">I know I am going to miss some names on the list, but I want to give a bit of a scale of some who have been impacted. I think of Duncan, Brett, Michael, Blake, Olivier, Jay, Megan and the Simms boys, just to name a few. Just like him, he wanted us to be authentic and humble. He wanted us to be proud of where we were, what we were doing, where we were going and what it meant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646599">Simply put, he wanted each one of us to believe in ourselves and he made that a little bit easier. He loved telling stories and he had so many profound statements. I do not know what to call them other than Bob-isms. I can think of a couple, one of which was, “I take the view that if you give up fat, sugar, and alcohol too, you may not live longer, it will just feel that way.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646600">On a more serious note, there are two quotes. “Life is about chapters. You have to turn the page on one before you can start the next.” “Nothing lasts forever, and nothing stays the same.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646601">He lived in the now. He was not one for birthdays or arbitrary reasons to celebrate. He preferred milestones and achievements. He espoused sharing stories of the past, not living them, of looking to the future but not dwelling on it, enjoying the moment, and being proud and happy with where you were, being rational and thoughtful, asking questions and acting with purpose, and recognizing that the best way to achieve success was to do it with passion and to embrace the challenge in front of us and to find the opportunity within it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646602">When Bob retired, our relationship did not just stop like we would expect with many bosses and their employees. He called in regularly to catch up. I would go visit Bob and Caroline at the farm. He was the first to pledge a donation when I called him with the crazy idea that I was going to run for politics. He was the one I had introduce me at the nomination campaign launch. He has been by my side since the day we met and I will forever appreciate his friendship, as I know so many others do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646603">The best part is that I am not unique. There are so many others. I am part of a massive group of people to whom he has meant more than he can ever know. I am going to miss Bob. I thought we had more calls. I thought we had more business on the farm ahead of us. I will be forever grateful for all he has done for me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646604">In closing, I want to share a quote from one of Bob's favourite writers, Henry David Thoreau. “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646605">Bob lived and lived well. He was a great Canadian and he will live on in all of us who had the privilege to know him. I cannot think of any higher achievement, any higher recognition of a life well lived, than having those who knew us proudly say, after we are gone, that we lost one of the good ones but that I am happy I knew him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646606">He achieved that. We will miss him and we will never forget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646609">Mr. Speaker, to be very brief, I did not know Bob Sopuck before the by-election in which he was successfully elected. He and I were elected at the same time. He had a very strong personality, a personality that sticks with someone, as did the manner in which he conveyed his thoughts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646610">I always thought of Bob as a great outdoorsman, someone who truly understood the benefits of a healthy environment, whether it is nature, land or water. I had a deep respect for him. I would classify him as a true Conservative, but a Conservative who could really express himself. One would respect the gentleman and his attitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646611">I want to give my condolences to Caroline and the family. I know Bob will be dearly missed and in the prayers of many of his former constituents and Manitoban families. I was really touched by the member's comments in regard to Bob, and I wanted to take the opportunity to wish his family and friends well, and give them our prayers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646613">The member touched on something I find quite interesting. Bob always talked about the fact that “conservation” and “conservative” come from the same root word. He was the biggest believer and defender of the fact that Conservatives had nothing to be ashamed of when it came to the environment. The greenest prime minister in Canadian history was Brian Mulroney.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646614"> His focus was always on outcomes, not process. It drove him up a wall when there was more of a concern on how do we get to where we are going, rather than actually getting there. That focus on outcomes would serve us all well in our lives, but more broadly in government. Government is a behemoth that often, as Bob always said, does not understand many of the facets of our way of life. That is why it is so vital that we step up to defend them and fight as true environmentalists for a better, healthier planet based on metrics. We need to improve the biodiversity of wetland habitats and fishery stocks. That is what I am going to continue to fight for.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646615">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by commending the member for Portage—Lisgar for his touching tribute. We were touched by his testimony. On behalf of the Bloc Québécois and all of the people we represent, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to my colleague and to the family and friends of Robert Sopuck. I encourage them to take care of themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646616">I was elected in 2019, so I did not have the privilege of knowing Mr. Sopuck. However, based on what I have heard this morning, I think I would have really liked to meet him. It seems as though he was a true model of commitment. He was described as a right-wing environmentalist, which is something that we do not see very often. I think that we need more people like him, compassionate people with a sense of duty. According to what the member for Portage—Lisgar said, Mr. Sopuck stood up for the little guy. I like that and I support it. The role of an MP is to stand up for their constituents, to proudly and faithfully represent them and to go to bat for them. I support that too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646617">That is a challenge that the 338 members of the House of Commons have to deal with on a daily basis: Knowing when to go to bat for their constituents publicly and when to do so privately. A lot of informal discussions take place here, and I think we get a lot of results that way. I am absolutely convinced that I would have loved this man.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646618">Take what I just said as an example. I am a Bloc member from Quebec talking about a Conservative member from Manitoba, and I have just pointed out a number of things we have in common. We must always remember that, most of the time, we have a lot more in common than we might think. I urge us to work together to make progress on the issues and improve society, for the common good. I am sure my colleague from Portage—Lisgar will agree with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646619">On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, all our elected officials and all those we represent, I once again offer my most sincere condolences.</ParaText>

He always felt a strong connection with many people in Quebec. That is why he was focused on Canada broadly and on the many individuals who shared his views. I could not be more proud of that and can only aim and hope to achieve half of what that man ever did.</ParaText>

As part of his enthusiasm, he was also a dedicated conservationist. As someone who comes to this place on the heels of Linda Duncan, another important conservationist in the House, I know that was very important to the New Democrats.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646626">Bob probably did not get along with every NDP MP and certainly would happily disagree on many policy issues, but to give an example where that was not the case, I note former MP Fin Donnelly. I had the privilege of joining them on occasion for a scotch and an across-the-lines political and candid among-the-rurals conversation, because that was the kind of guy Bob was. He could not necessarily understand why people felt the way they did, but he would say that we should probably sit down and ask them. That is what made him a brilliant communicator for different audiences, particularly the urban audiences that he worked with during his time at the Winnipeg Free Press.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646627">I think Bob still owed Fin a couple of bottles of scotch from a couple of bets that did not go his way, but he will hopefully be forgiven for that. I know he enjoyed many opportunities with some of his former colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646628">Mr. Speaker, what is funny is that, even though I am an Alberta MP who has been here for quite some time, two of my best friends have been Bob Sopuck and Candice Bergen, the MP my colleague just replaced. People back home might be questioning my Alberta credentials right now, but they do not need to worry about that; they are still intact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646629">Of course, I express my condolences to Caroline and the entire family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646630"> One thing I look back on is that Bob and I spent a lot of time here together. He put the meat on the bones of the Conservative hunting and angling caucus. He galvanized it. I was here a bit before him and we became instant friends because of our like-minded views of the world. I grew up on a beef ranch in Alberta and loved hunting and fishing. I have spent time as an outdoorsman, a conservation officer, a national park warden and a fisheries technician for Alberta Fish and Wildlife working on walleye. We became fast friends. I was able to spend a bit of time in his riding and he was able to spend a bit time in mine. We did a bit of hunting and fishing together too. The Sims boys were there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646631">One of the best duck hunts I have ever been on in my life was with Bob Sopuck. These canvasbacks were going 100 miles an hour, jinking all over the place. We could not hit anything. I openly admit that. I think we probably fired 100 rounds of shotgun shells and came back with three ducks, but we had a lot of fun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646632"> He was a great guy, and I am beside myself. I am going to miss Bob. We stayed in touch on a regular basis. He did not just come and go or do his thing and leave; he still cared. I was so angry when he left because I felt like I lost half of the duo, but I am glad he did now because we never know how much time we are going to have. I am glad that he was able to spend those years back in his beautiful log house on the farm with Caroline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646633">One thing I loved about Bob is that he would always find a way to defend rural folk. As a guy who grew up on a cow-calf operation, he would defend beef farmers as some of the best environmentalists we have. They are often under attack. I wonder if my colleague would elaborate on how well Mr. Sopuck defended the cattle ranchers in this great country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646635">Bob cherished those hunts and those days on the lake with the member and so many other people. That is where he was happy. On the beautiful, sprawling farm he had, he managed the landscape. He was a gardener of his little piece of earth. That was the way he thought. He wanted more ducks, more available, and he took action to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646636">When I was working for him, we made a video called “Eating Canadian Beef is Good for the Environment”. It did not seem that controversial, but it did get a bit of push-back. It was the first time that I learned many animal rights activists are kind of sociopaths, and he warned me about that. A lot of the online comments, death threats and suggestions of ways he should die, which I hid with current advanced tools, were telling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646637"> He did it with such pride. He knew that ranchers are our best boots on the ground and are important for maintaining our national grasslands and rural communities. I could not say how many groups thought he was the best friend they could have ever had: hunters, anglers, trappers, ranchers, every other type of agricultural producer and many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646638"> He was always grounded by his belief in the rural way of life: protecting it, maintaining it and fighting for it. He was one of the best at it there could ever be.</ParaText>

As I was preparing for this speech, I took the time to read some of the comments you made. I have sat here and listened to government members, or future opposition members, hopefully in the near future, raise some of their concerns. I was not here for the debate when we were raising the question of privilege in the first place, but I did not realize that those concerns had been raised. You, Mr. Speaker, dealt with them and made the ruling that you made regardless. It is interesting to note that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646659">Here we are today as a House continuing to fight this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646660">We can take a look at some of the background, for folks who might be tuning in for the first time. Many people have heard of what we have referred to as the green slush fund, but we could refer to it with many different terms, all of which would probably properly focus on the scandalous nature of this situation. It goes back to the Auditor General of Canada finding that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> turned SDTC into a slush fund for Liberal insiders, and this is the point we have made over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646661">There is a recording of a senior civil servant talking about the “outright incompetence” of the Liberal government giving 390 million dollars' worth of contracts out inappropriately, at a time when the government is racking up unprecedented, and “unprecedented” is not a strong enough word for it, levels of spending, deficits and debt. We are spending more today on interest on the debt racked up by this government than we are spending on transfers to the provinces for health care. That is unheard of. I think that is uncomprehensible for most Canadians, and it is understandable that people would be infuriated by what they are hearing and that they would want answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646662">What we are doing here, holding this place, temporarily, as His Majesty's official opposition, is getting prepared to clean up the mess the Liberal government has created. We are standing here on behalf of voters. I have the privilege to stand here on behalf of the voters of Edmonton—Wetaskiwin, who at every turn are asking me to level some form of accountability from the government, using the power I have, with the seat I have in the House, for the unbelievably and devastatingly wasteful spending we have seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646663">In this case, we are talking about $390 million. The Auditor General found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that, on occasions, could not demonstrate any environmental benefit or development of green technology at all. We are talking about $334 million, from 186 cases, to projects where board members held a conflict of interest and $58 million to projects without ensuring contribution agreements were met. I believe the Auditor General also made it very clear that the responsibility falls on the Liberal government and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646664">We are here to get answers. We moved a motion so information could be made available to the appropriate authorities. I have to make it really clear that nowhere in the motion does the House order the RCMP to conduct an investigation. This is something the Liberals have said over and over again. The House is simply asking that documents be provided and have the opportunity to be scrutinized.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646665">The whistle-blower who was at the public accounts committee had this to say: “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.” We trust the whistle-blower, and if the documents are provided, we have faith in the RCMP to decide what to do with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646666">I will note, for history's sake, that the Auditor General gave a clean bill of health to SDTC back in 2017, so it is important to understand the timeline, with a government that chose Liberal insiders as board members since then. Liberal members have had lots of time to speak on this topic and make arguments. It was only after 2017 that we saw the board voting to give itself tax dollars from the fund the Auditor General is referring to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646667">It is interesting because the hon. member, the lead member in the House for the Liberal side who stands up so often in this place and who just heckled me, can go into caucus every Wednesday and, if he wants to, make the argument to have these documents produced so Canadians can make their assessment. Surely, if his argument is correct, the documents will bear that out and then he can stand up in the House and point to those documents. I am not sure whether he can get on the list to actually speak in the caucus meetings; I am not sure what the process is. It might be easier to get up on this topic. I am sure the Liberals are looking for anybody to get up and talk about anything other than whether their leader should step down right now, so maybe this is the time. I will give him some advice, if he is willing to take it, that maybe this is his opportunity to make the argument for the release of these documents so his arguments can be borne out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646668">I will tell members why Canadians are concerned. I host constituent round tables. We do something a little unique where we bring in 16 constituents on a rotating basis and do 40 or 50 two-hour round tables; people come in, we go around the table and everybody gets a chance to speak, which may be a bit foreign to Liberal members. Everybody gets a chance to speak and raise their issues, and then we have a really good discussion on the issues. I will tell members that at these round tables, people are talking about how they are trying to live their lives in the context of the unbelievable crises, on multiple fronts, that have been caused by the Liberal government. They bring up issues around housing. More and more people are showing up at my round tables. This is in Alberta, where the cost of housing is less expensive than in other parts of the world, but still constituents are talking about housing challenges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646669">The thing I have noticed more than at any other time, and I have been hosting these round tables for 19 years as a member of Parliament, is that I am seeing 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds coming to round tables talking about the fact that they are having trouble finding work. Then, when they find work and start working full time, they do not believe they are ever going to be able to afford a down payment for a house. In some cases, they are worried they cannot even afford rent for a house. Again, this is not something that I have seen before. However, I have actually seen the same kinds of concerns brought up as I have travelled the country speaking on other things to university students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646670">Another thing we are hearing a lot about is crime and safety. I am hearing more from young people who are going to university and do not feel safe on public transit anymore. It is an absolutely common concern brought up by constituents at my round tables. Also, I am certainly hearing a lot about budget balance and fiscal responsibility, and questions on who is going to pay for this massive bill incurred by the Liberal government; I do not even want to say it is with a lack of results.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646671">Certainly, there has been a lack of results corresponding to the spending, but the worst thing about this situation is that the more the government spends, the worse the results are. Our outcomes are going down on almost every front that can be measured. The Liberals' response in the House of Commons day in and day out is to ask why we will not support their ever-increasing spending. They have introduced new programs. It is probably good that we are having this prolonged debate right now, in the sense that we want to get an outcome with some accountability; at the same time, while we are having this conversation, the Liberals cannot introduce a new $10-billion, $20-billion or $30-billion program they have cooked up with the NDP, in partnership, to drive us even further into debt. Day in and day out, that has been the Liberals' answer: “Why will you not spend more? Why will you not support us to spend even more money?” Taking a look at the numbers, over $300 million in this case, it is no wonder Canadians do not trust the government to spend their money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646672">I was elected in January 2006. When I got elected, I replaced someone who had sat on the Liberal side for four straight elections. The context at that time, the main issue, was the sponsorship scandal. The sponsorship scandal did not even come close to touching the numbers we are talking about now. We talked at that point about the long-gun registry that had been brought in by the Liberal government. That seems like ancient history, but we are seeing history repeating itself over and over again. Now we have a gun buyback, which is a complete misnomer because the government never owned the firearms in the first place. The government is talking about spending billions of dollars buying firearms from law-abiding Canadians while record levels of firearms are being smuggled into our country, illegal firearms being used by criminals on the street right now, and the government is doing nothing about it. Of course, back in those days, we also had the HRDC boondoggle and irresponsible spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646673">At that time, those were huge issues that brought down a minority Liberal government, but the context is much different today. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars more in deficit spending over the years and our fiscal situation is on the brink of disaster. We have not seen it this tough since the Trudeau years of the 1970s and 1980s. The Trudeau legacy was very difficult for subsequent governments to dig out of. In fact, as I often remind my Liberal colleague across the way, it was the Martin-Chrétien Liberal government that had to cut record levels in spending for health care, social services and education. Because of the policies of the Trudeau government of the seventies and eighties, there had to be 32% cut, absolutely cut, from spending on health care, social services and education, through government transfers, in 1995. That legacy has obviously continued and worsened today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646674">We are in a worse situation today because of subsequent governments within that same legacy. I believe that out of 25 budgets, there were 24 deficits. That is intolerable when we look at the context of what we are discussing today. We need to get to the bottom of this. As we work to get to the bottom of this, I think the one thing that would help right now would be, quite honestly, if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> finally had a realization, if he listened to some of his caucus colleagues who are speaking out. If there is a lot of confidence over there, maybe we will hear that in their questions: declarations of confidence in the Liberal government's approach to things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646675">If the Liberals are so confident in their approach, maybe we could have an election. Maybe this would be the time. It is the longest-serving minority Parliament in history because of the support the NDP has given the Liberals, to prop it up. Maybe it is time we have an election and take it to the people. If the hon. member over there and his colleagues are so confident, surely their fortunes would turn around and they would be confident in having an election based on the policies of the government, a carbon tax election, which so many Canadians are calling for.</ParaText>

It does not want the documents released, not because it is concerned about the legal process but because it is embarrassed. The Auditor General has found that Liberal appointees gave $400 million of taxpayers' money to their own companies. This involved 186 conflicts of interest. The government is concerned that providing the documents would reveal even more corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646716">The issue is about $400 million of wasted or stolen taxpayers' money, while Canadians cannot afford to eat, heat their home and house themselves. The government's embarrassment is understandable. The implication of what has so far been revealed is that Liberals were illegally benefiting Liberals, advancing their own interests and aspirations instead of the country's best interests. What was supposed to be a way of fighting climate change was instead a way to line the pockets of people who had Liberal connections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646717">After nine years of the current government, Canadians are not surprised by the climate hypocrisy; however, there is no reason for them to accept it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has apparently forgotten his own words about admitting mistakes and learning from them, or maybe he thinks he and his government are so perfect that mistakes are impossible so there is nothing to acknowledge and nothing to learn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646718">The government seems to think there is a problem with the opposition parties in this matter. The Liberals say that the work of the House is being tied up and that if the opposition would just allow a committee to deal with the matter, then we could get on with more important business. The government wants to know why the opposition cannot see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646719">When Liberal cabinet ministers make statements like that, they seem to have checked their collective brain at the door. What is more important for the House than to establish that the government does not dictate to the elected members? When the House makes an order and the Speaker affirms the order, the government does not get to say no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646720">I realize it would be more convenient for the Liberals if the opposition did not exist. That may be why its first idea at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was to suggest that it be given free rein to act without parliamentary oversight. The government wanted the opposition parties to go home and allow it to work without oversight. That is not the way parliamentary democracy is supposed to work. I would hope that the government MPs who were here at the time look back on that period with a certain amount of embarrassment that they were persuaded to agree to such a thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646721"> This was, after all, supposed to be the most open and transparent government in Canadian history. In 2013, the newly elected Liberal leader, today's <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, said, “Political leadership is about raising the bar on openness and transparency.” Eleven years later, the government has a reputation for secrecy. The Prime Minister will not release the documents. What is he trying to hide?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646722">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to have forgotten his own words, or maybe he was just saying something he did not believe in order to get elected. Canadians believed him when he said, “For me, transparency isn’t a slogan or a tactic; it’s a way of doing business.” In 2024, Canadians doubt the truth of that statement. Obviously it was a slogan and a tactic designed to fool the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646723">Canadians are no longer fooled. If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government believed in transparency, there would be no need for me to be speaking today. They would have released the documents already. Instead they look like a criminal with something to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646724">The supposedly open and transparent government is defying the will of the House. The Liberals' actions show just how hollow their idealistic words are. If the Liberals want to move the work of the House forward, something we all would like to see, then the path forward is simple: Obey the will of the House, accept the ruling of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> and provide the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646725">What happens to the documents is not the Liberals' concern. They are not the Law Clerk. They are not the RCMP. The government should not be telling others what to do with the material. The Liberals have already shown that a cover-up is their preference. They must end the cover-up and hand over the evidence to the police so Parliament can get back to working for Canadians. Why do they continue to defy the will of the House and the ruling of their own <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646726">It is probably worth mentioning again why this is an issue. The Auditor General of Canada found that the government, led by a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who boasted about transparency, turned Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. A recording of senior civil servants slammed the outright incompetence of the Liberal government, which gave 390 million dollars' worth of contracts inappropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646727">The Auditor General also found that, first, SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on some occasions could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology. Second, $334 million was given to over 186 projects in which board members had a conflict of interest. Third, $58 million was given to projects without ensuring that contribution agreement terms were met. The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for the scandal falls on the industry minister, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646728"> By not complying with the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling, the Liberals have paralyzed Parliament, making it impossible for anyone here to address issues like the doubling of housing costs, Liberal food inflation, and crime and chaos. Given the Liberal record, I wonder whether that is their plan. With the level of incompetence they have displayed over the past nine years, I would not want to talk about housing, crime or the economy either, but maybe we should.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646729">After all, after nine years of the Liberal government, Canadians have never been less safe. Insane catch-and-release policies are putting dangerous repeat violent offenders back onto our streets. The reckless experiment of taxpayer-funded hard drugs has created crime, chaos and disorder across Canada. Statistics Canada has revealed that since 2015, violent crime is up by nearly 50%. Homicides are up 28%, while sexual assaults, auto theft and extortion are up 74%, 45% and 357% respectively.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646730"> Meanwhile, the Liberals' failed experiment funding hard drugs with taxpayer dollars has increased drug deaths by 184% since 2015. In London, Ontario, the chief of police has been clear about the unfolding disaster, saying, “Diverted safe supply is being resold into our community. It's being trafficked into other communities and it is being used as currency in exchange for fentanyl, fuelling the drug trade.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646731">In British Columbia, the Vancouver Police Department noted that around 50% of all hydromorphone seizures were diverted from the<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s taxpayer-funded hard drugs program. Since 2015, nearly 45,000 Canadians have died from drug overdose. It seems that everyone except the current government can see the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646732">When it comes to housing, the Liberals know they created a problem, but they do not know how to fix it. Housing has become unaffordable in Canada because we are failing to build enough homes for Canadians. This was confirmed by a recent report from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, which showed that Canada is still building fewer homes than in the 1970s, when Canada had half the population it has today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646733">National housing starts declined by 13% between August 2023 and August 2024. There has been a 25% drop in housing starts in Ontario. In Toronto, housing starts in August 2024 had a massive 48% decline over 2023, while Vancouver saw a drop of 34% year over year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646734">The Liberals' housing hell is not limited to Toronto or Vancouver. Across British Columbia, housing starts dropped by 31%, and in Victoria housing starts decline by 33%. Manitoba and Saskatchewan housing starts have dropped by 14% and 12% respectively during the first eight months of this year compared to the same period in 2023. Winnipeg's housing starts are down by 16% over the same period, while Ottawa had 17% fewer new housing projects. Housing remains unaffordable in Canada, in spite of the Liberals' giving billions of dollars to the same gatekeepers who caused the housing crisis in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646735">Since last year, food prices in Canada have risen overall by 3.9%, with meat up by 9.5% and margarine up by 9.9%. The price of baby food has increased by 5%. These price increases hit seniors and low-income Canadian families the hardest. According to a recent poll by Angus Reid Institute, more than one-third of Canadians have struggled to afford enough food to feed their family. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646736"> Our food prices are an afterthought for the Liberal government. While inflation may have slowed, food prices are not going down, and the Liberal's carbon tax further restricts producers' competitiveness through added transportation costs. It is fair to say that Canada's food security is at a tipping point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646737">These are definitely not topics that the Liberals want to address. Since they have no plans to fix anything, they instead tie up the work of the House, hoping that Canadians will not notice. The Liberals try to pretend that they are standing on principle, instead of being open and transparent. They are trying to convince Canadians that covering up wrongdoing is a virtue. Canadians do not believe them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646738">The Liberals say it is all the opposition's fault, while they continue to do the wrong thing as they ignore the will of the House of Commons and the authority of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>. Instead they are trying to deflect the issue and are pretending the order is somehow improper. What could be more proper than the House of Commons' demanding accountability from the government? There is 800 years of constitutional tradition backing that up. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> may not like it, but we are not here to do what he likes; we are here to do what is right.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646739">The government's House leader has said this debate is, “something every single Canadian should be extremely alarmed about.” I agree. Canadians should be alarmed and concerned about a government that thinks it is above the law. Canadians should be alarmed by a government whose ministers do not seem to understand what constitutes a conflict of interest. Canadians should be alarmed by a government that illegally rewards its friends. Canadians should be alarmed by a government that tries to cover things up while claiming to be open and transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646740">Parliament needs to be respected by the government. The documents must be released. It is not the government's responsibility to consider what happens when the documents are released. It can let the law clerk and the RCMP worry about that. That is not the Liberals' job. The Liberals' duty is to release the documents and to stop their contempt of Parliament, which is the democratic system that they claim to uphold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646741">When a party that claims to be the most transparent government in Canadian history refuses to respect the will of the House of Commons, Canadians are right in wondering what the party is trying to hide. We know there is something questionable about the $400 million. How much more is there? Canadians deserve to know the truth, no matter how much the Liberals want to cover it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646742">We all know why we are here. The Liberals' selective amnesia is not fooling Canadians. The Auditor General found evidence of serious mismanagement at SDTC, and maybe even criminal activity. The Liberals response to this, as with so many other things, is to cover it up and pretend there is no problem. Maybe, from their perspective, there is no problem. After all, apparently the funds in question went to those with Liberal connections. How can anyone see a conflict of interest in awarding contracts to a few friends?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646743">The Liberals need to remember that this is not their money. The $400 million did not come from the Liberal Party. It came from ordinary Canadians who are struggling to put food on the table as they are being carbon taxed to death. They deserve better. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is fond of telling the media and the House that Canadians will forgive him for not taking direction from the Conservatives. His ministers frequently use the same line. It makes for a nice media clip.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646744">However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers really should take direction from Conservatives respecting Parliament, ethics and transparency, not to mention crime, housing, taxation and balancing the budget. No, I do not think Canadians are going to forgive him.</ParaText>

It is very unfortunate, but knowing the nature of the government, and of the member who asks the same question over and over again, the answer is simple. They should be transparent and tell Canadians what they are hiding about that $400 million. They need to tell the truth about what they have done. Then we will have a chance to discuss other things. Otherwise, they have had scandals, worth many billions of dollars, that Canadians are fed up with. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646776">Mr. Speaker, is an honour to rise in the House once again. Before I speak to the motion of privilege, if the House will indulge me, I will say that tomorrow will be one year since the of passing of mom and missing of her cookies. However, we smile and we celebrate her life today. I know that she watched me speak many times in the House. As we have all lost loved ones, it kind of hits home today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646777">First and foremost, I am honoured to represent the wonderful people of Essex and to address the House today. As my colleague and friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278561" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation>, pointed out last week during his speech on this very topic, we are once again proud to stand today on behalf of the constituents of our ridings to hold the government accountable for its Liberal corruption. However, we do not take any pleasure in this. Returning to our ridings, trying to explain how the government has undermined our institutions and corrupted the way government operates is truly a disheartening example of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646778"> I want to highlight the government's mishandling of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, often called the green slush fund. This program was created in 2001 to support innovation and sustainable technologies, and ran smoothly under both Liberal and Conservative governments until the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. I know a thing or two about clean technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646779"> It is unacceptable that the Liberals are refusing to hand over all the documents related to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> green slush fund to the RCMP within the required days. My colleagues on the public accounts committee received a report from the Auditor General last June in which she found that the Liberal government had turned the once legitimate Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. The Auditor General found that the Liberal-appointed SDTC board members who voted to give out that money had a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646780">I am tired of this lack of transparency, which only deepens distrust and frustrations among Canadians. After nearly a decade in power, we have yet more evidence that the NDP-Liberals are not worth the cost in terms of both financial resources and the increasing crime and corruption that has plagued the government. Their inability to be transparent about their actions is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646781"> The Speaker has ruled that the NDP-Liberals have violated a House order to turn over evidence to the police regarding a criminal investigation into their latest $400-million scandal. This blatant disregard for accountability shows their ongoing refusal to be open and honest with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646782"> The Speaker's ruling, coupled with the NDP-Liberals' stubbornness, has effectively paralyzed Parliament. This inaction makes it impossible for us to address pressing issues like skyrocketing housing costs, rampant food inflation and the rise of crime and chaos in our communities. We cannot move forward while they hide behind their secrecy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646783">While it used to be normal for working-class young people to buy homes, now 80% of Canadians tell pollsters that home ownership is only for the very rich and definitely out of their reach. After nine years of NDP-Liberals the situation is so bad that there are now 1,400 homeless encampments in Ontario alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646784">In Ontario and British Columbia, government charges account for more than 30% for the cost of a new home. The federal government takes the biggest share. In Ontario, about 39% of total taxes on a new home go to politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa. The GST alone adds $50,000 in cost to a $1 million home. In my great riding of Essex, people are struggling. According to the Windsor-Essex County Association of Realtors' September market update, the average sales price was up 8.2% to $579,290.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646785">At a time when many Canadians are struggling to make ends meet, with rising housing and food costs, it is incredibly disappointing that we find ourselves still discussing the Liberal government's role in the $400-million green slush fund scandal. The Auditor General has clearly stated that the responsibility for this scandal lies directly with the former Liberal industry minister, as well as the current one, who failed to adequately oversee the contracts awarded to Liberal insiders. This lack of oversight has contributed to a serious breach of public trust at a moment when transparency and accountability are more important than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646786"> At the heart of this issue is the Auditor General's finding that Liberal appointees were allocating $400 million of taxpayer money to their own companies, resulting in 186 documented conflicts of interest. This is not just a scandal; it is a betrayal of the trust that Canadians place in their government, and it underscores the urgent need for transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646787">This money could have gone back into the pockets of hard-working Canadians or toward beneficial programs that would help our communities. This money may have been used to support neighbourhood projects, support the growth of small enterprises or lessen the financial strain on families dealing with growing expenses. It is a lost chance that may have had a significant impact on the lives of regular people. We are talking about $400 million in taxpayer money that may have been wasted or stolen, while everyday Canadians struggle to afford food, heating and housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646788">This situation is intolerable, especially when so many are suffering due to the government's lack of accountability. The NDP-Liberals must put an end to their cover-up and hand over the evidence to the police. Only then can Parliament get back to its critical work of serving the interests of Canadians. Their continued obstruction is unacceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646789"> The division between those in government and regular Canadians who must deal with the fallout from such carelessness is widened by this incident. Why will the NDP-Liberals not stop hiding behind the green slush fund and release the required documentation so that Canadians can have the openness and accountability they deserve? Only our sensible Conservative colleagues will put an end to the turmoil and corruption and figure out what happened to the $400 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646790"> To know where we are going, we must know where we came from, and it is really important to speak about the scandal timeline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646791">Dating back all the way to late 2018, the then Liberal industry minister, Navdeep Bains, expressed concerns regarding the Harper-era chair of SDTC, Jim Balsillie, given his public criticism of the government's privacy legislation. Minister Bains then proposed two alternative chairs to the CEO of SDTC as replacements in a phone call. One of the candidates proposed was Annette Verschuren, an entrepreneur who was receiving SDTC funds through one of her companies. Then the minister, PMO and PCO were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflict chair, and were told that, up until this point, the fund never had a chair who had interests in companies. It then went into June 2019, another full year later, and Minister Bains decided to proceed with the appointment of Annette Verschuren despite repeated warnings expressed to his office. The new chair then went on to create an environment where conflict of interests were tolerated and “managed”. Minister Bains then went on to appoint two other controversial board members who engage in unethical behaviour in a breach of conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646792">Now we are all the way to June of 2024. By the way, I skipped over five or six other points I could have made. However, in June of 2024, the Auditor General's report was released, finding severe governance failures of SDTC. Our colleagues asked a whole bunch of very direct, pointed questions at the committee. One of the testimonies on SDTC in committee was that:</ParaText>

They are very busy trying to get their lives back in order after the failed Liberal-NDP coalition. Because of that, I want to give a quick overview of the privilege motion and why it is so important that we have this debate today. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646797"> To really bring us all back to kindergarten, the key mandate of SDTC, a federally funded non-profit, is to approve and disburse over $100 million in funds annually to clean technology companies. In a former life, back when I was in the world of business, we did exactly that: clean technology. Is it a good thing to have clean technology? Absolutely, it is. It protects our environment and creates great jobs. Exporting that technology is a lot of what our business did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646798">However, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada through the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act to fund the development and demonstration of new technologies. It is an arm's-length, not-for-profit organization that was created to support projects that develop and demonstrate new technologies that address issues related to climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil. It is responsible for the administration of the tech fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646799">Here are the problems. The key problem is that SDTC executives awarded to projects, in which they held conflicts, over $330-million worth of taxpayer funds.</ParaText>

What he really said was that we were going to have an election on transparency. Canadians not only deserve the documentation, Canadians want the documentation. They want it handed over so that the RCMP can do what it needs to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646802">Why are we into, I believe, week four of this debate, if the government has absolutely nothing to hide and no conflict of interest and if there is nothing to see here, just like the many other conflicts of interest that we have seen the government, since 2015, be a part of?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646803">Canadians do not forget. They do not forget about the Aga Khan. They do not forget about the WE scandal. It is getting awfully tiring to have to continue to hold the government to account, to hold its feet to the fire, when what we really should be debating in the House is how we are going to get Canadians' lives back on track. We cannot do it because we need to know the truth. We need to know where the slush fund dollars are going. We know who is ultimately responsible for this. We need to know for sure that these dollars were invested properly, that big corporations, big buddies of the Liberals, are not padding their pockets with this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646805"> I was elected in 2019 and they just said to bring common sense to the House of Commons. I said that I would do my best.

Therefore, we in the House of Commons, the official opposition, deserve answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646807">That is why I am very proud to speak about this today. We will continue to hold the government to account. It is the service and the job of the official opposition to hold the government to account. That is why it is so important, to those folks at home who perhaps wonder why we are spending so many days on this. Quite frankly, it is because we are responsible to them, ultimately, and we will not stop. We will be very steadfast in continuing the hard work that we do here in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646808">In closing, I just really want to reiterate one more time why this is so important. It is a question of privilege for all of us. We know that we cannot effectively do the important work that we are asked to do without the answers. We are not asking for anything other than the documents. It is as though I had a buddy and my buddy said to just show them, if we have nothing to hide. All we are really asking is for them to just show us. If they have nothing to hide, show us, and we will move on with government business. </ParaText>

It is an important disclosure, yet many different proposals have been provided to a number of Conservatives on how to get past the stalemate.

              <ParaText id="8646840"> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the democracy-defending constituents of the autumn-coloured riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. Today, we are debating a subamendment to the amendment of the motion. That is about as parliamentary a sentence one could say in this chamber. This motion calls for the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to complete a report on the government's green slush fund scandal. The amendment adds some witnesses, along with the subamendment. However, Parliament is what this debate is truly about: Parliament and the government's contempt for parliamentary democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646841">Exposing government corruption is a core function of Parliament. As one of the longest-serving members in Parliament, I have seen off a few governments. There is a natural tension between a government and any Parliament, but the current government is different because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is different. Never before have we had a Prime Minister who openly stated his admiration for the Communists who control China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646842">It is not unlike the praise that former Liberal prime minister Mackenzie King gave Adolf Hitler. Writing in his diary, the former Prime Minister described meeting Hitler. He wrote that he had personally praised Hitler for the “constructive work of his regime”. The current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made these comments: “There's a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, ‘We need to go green...we need to start investing in solar.’”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646843"> Liberals like Mackenzie King were enamoured with how the national socialists turned the German economy around on a dime following the Great Depression. Both past and present Liberal prime ministers seem to forget what prevents them from simply waving their hands and issuing orders like some king is democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646844">These are not just a couple of prime ministers who admired dictators for their good looks and nice socks. These Liberal men were praising dictatorships for their dictatorial policies. If that were the end, if this had just been one comment one time, most people would have forgotten it. However, remarkably, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems almost maniacal in his commitment to proving his critics correct. He heard the expression “do not judge a person by what they say; judge them by what they do” and took it to heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646845">The Liberal government's refusal to obey an order of Parliament is the current thing it is doing. When sports leagues began shutting down in March 2020 and the government decided to follow the lead of the NHL, the first instinct of the government was to grab as much power as it could. The Liberals sought to rule without restoring Parliament for two years. When that was quickly rejected—</ParaText>

Those well-connected Liberals from WE Charity, with their billion-dollar made-up program, were to give money out to applicants, just like the green slush fund.

              <ParaText id="8646852"> I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that this motion is not really about Liberal corruption as much as it is about the Liberal government's contempt for democracy, and in particular the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s disdain for it.

              <ParaText id="8646860"> Mr. Speaker, on that day, the NDP were acting a little silly. They were lightheartedly trying to delay the vote by blocking Gord from coming down the aisle. The NDP were not being out of line or in any way aggressive. Anyone who knew Gord knew he could stickhandle his way past any opponent if he wanted to. However, that is not what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> saw. He saw the NDP blocking his agenda, grew impatient, left his chair and crossed the floor, a floor that is two sword lengths for a reason. This is meant to symbolize that we value debate over physical conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646861">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> crossed that symbolic floor, grabbed Gord and pulled him through the crowd of MPs. In the process, he elbowed an NDP MP in the breast. The Prime Minister of Canada had physically assaulted two opposition members because he was impatient with parliamentary democracy, just as he is now. That should have been the end of him as Prime Minister, but apparently that is not disqualifying for the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646862">Had the Liberal backbench had the courage, they could have removed him then. That would have spared them the optics of kicking out Canada's first aboriginal attorney general from her job for not following the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s order to obstruct justice. Had they acted then, Canada might have had a Prime Minister who read his briefing notes about the Communists he admires interfering in democracy, and that is what these documents relate to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646863">Instead, they sat on their hands and watched passively as scandal after scandal revealed their emperor had no clothes, except for his pretty socks. This should not surprise anyone. Too often, I have heard Liberal MPs refer to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> as their boss. That comment alone tells us how upside down the Liberals see democracy. This is well understood in other Westminster-style parliaments, but these Liberals clearly need it explained to them in simple terms. The leader of a party is not the boss. Our constituents are the boss. We work for them. The leader works for us. That is how parliamentary democracy is supposed to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646864">Instead, the Liberals have handed all their power to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his powerful PMO. Now the Prime Minister is rubbing their faces in it. He keeps finding himself in contempt of Parliament because he has nothing but contempt for Parliament. However, it is not just Parliament. Something about the serving Prime Minister makes former cabinet ministers want to bare their soul in the form of a tell-all book. It is almost a form of seeking absolution for the sin of enabling him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646865">What is alarming is how much these books reveal about the aloof, incurious and arrogant <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. More alarming is that nothing has changed and every member of the Liberal Party knows it. They see first-hand how he manages caucus. Not once have I ever heard them speak about his democratic approach to party management. Canadians heard how the Prime Minister talked about being a party leader last week. He talked as if he had all the power and the caucus was merely there to be disposed of when convenient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646866">We are here debating a subamendment, but this is not really a debate. This is an order from the House of Commons. Just like with the cover-up of the infiltration of Communist agents in the Winnipeg lab, the government is refusing to follow an order given to it by the elected representatives of 41 million Canadians. The government has tried everything to prevent the release of the documents. It even tossed in the kitchen sink, doing so with a charter. Only a Liberal would claim that well-connected Liberals have a charter right to steal our money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646867">They can claim whatever they want. It does not change the fact that they are ignoring an order from the House. In doing so, the government showcases its contempt for Parliament, but it is not only its contempt for Parliament that is showing. By withholding documents demanded by Parliament, the government is showing contempt for its own members. Each of them ran on a platform. We will disagree with that platform strongly and would be happy to keep that platform off the House of Commons agenda until the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646868">What is in those documents that is so damaging to the Liberal Party that it would abandon any future Liberal legislation if it means it can keep the cover-up going a bit longer? Its position only becomes more untenable the minute we think of it for even a second. Eventually, the government shall fall. Eventually, the people truly behind this scandal will be exposed. When that day comes, all of this obstruction by the Liberals will be for nothing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646869">What will they have to show for it? The only conclusion a reasonable person could reach is that there is more to this and that what happened at SDTC was just the tip of the Liberals' corrupt iceberg. As I have pointed out previously, this scandal is nearly identical to that in the local journalism initiative. There, the government gave 60 million hard-earned taxpayer dollars to a group of media lobbyists. Those media lobbyists, in turn, formed a committee with the job of handing out money to the local media in order to hire a local journalist. Of the seven committee members, five handed cash out to their own companies. In order for a media outlet to receive funding for a local journalist, it must promise to hand over the content the local journalist produces, free of charge, to the Canadian Press news wire. Can we guess which committee the head of the Canadian Press sits on? Everybody in the legacy media knows about this corruption, but not a single one will report on it, even after being called out in the House twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646870">Before the current government, the biggest knock against the legacy media was its Liberal bias. Thanks to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canadians can add corruption to their list of media complaints, and that is not surprising. Everything the Prime Minister touches becomes tainted by him. Sustainable Development Technology Canada started over 20 years ago, and it had been a rare government success story; however, this bunch then did what they have done to so many Canadian institutions. They ruined it, and what is so egregious is that this never should have happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646871"> The government was warned. The former president at SDTC warned the minister not to appoint a person who had received funds from SDTC. That minister did it anyway. Now the organization is in shambles, and money is not going to qualified companies. Employees are demoralized because everything they touch becomes worse. How could it not under a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who admires a basic dictatorship? At the core of his authoritarian streak is a mentality in which the ends justify the means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646872">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sees jobs in his riding as an end, so he justifies obstructing justice and sacking an honest minister who got in his way. He saw a routine vote in the House of Commons as an end, so he justified physically assaulting another member of Parliament. He sees handing out cash to well-connected friends as an end, so he justifies ignoring Parliament to keep doing it. Before the Liberal Party's next caucus, all its members need to ask themselves when they will become the means to bring an end to the Prime Minister's misrule.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646873">As I mentioned earlier, the twin scandals of the green slush fund and the Liberal journalism initiative are just the ones we can see from our side of the floor. We know the government hands out so much money so quickly and with so few controls that it can fund a virulent anti-Semite to provide diversity training remotely from his home in Lebanon. Did anyone check to see if Laith Marouf was on any of those evacuation flights?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646874"> We are only standing at the base camp of a mountain of Liberal corruption. The government's entire agenda since 2021 has been to create unaccountable pots of money for its friends.</ParaText>

Some money will trickle down to a makeup artist on the set of CBC's next American-cloned reality show, but most of it will end up in the pockets of Liberal-connected lobbyists.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646907">Mr. Speaker, we are now in the third week of debating this privilege motion. It is the third week since the House came to a standstill, and it does not have to be this way. The blame lies four-square on the shoulders of the Liberal government. It is essentially snubbing its nose at Parliament; at you, Mr. Speaker; and ultimately at the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646908"> Parliament has a right to request documents, to hold the government to account and to get accurate information so we may or may not see, we do not know for sure, if there has been corruption at the expense of Canadians. The House requested that the documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada be provided, based on damning reports from the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646909">The Liberals did produce some documents, but far from the number they were supposed to and they blacked out page after page. We are getting, “Oh, that's very interesting information,” not. It is blacked out. “This is very interesting information,” not. It is blacked out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646910">It is a mockery of Parliament. Our party and the other opposition parties appealed to the Speaker's office to rule on this violation. I have to commend the Speaker, who made a careful examination, along with the table officers, and came back saying the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government were in violation of members of Parliament's privilege. That is why we are having this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646911">I know there are questions and accusations from the Liberals, saying we are just trying to delay Parliament, but the fact is that the Speaker ruled that they need to produce these documents and they have not. We are reminded of another situation not that long ago where a Liberal Speaker, a Liberal member of Parliament in the Speaker's role, just as the current Speaker is, ruled that documents regarding the lab in Winnipeg be produced. What did the Liberals do? They would not produce the documents. The Speaker ruled that they should produce them, and the government said it would take court action against the Liberal Speaker at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646912"> It did not go that far. He did not have his day in court. The Liberals thought maybe it was not the best idea, taking a Speaker to court, someone who was voted in as a Liberal, and that maybe it would be an opportune time to call an election, in the middle of the pandemic. It was something they said they would not do but then took advantage of, while hiding the information that never came out. It was probably damning information that would have impacted their electoral fortunes. That is what they did. They blocked, to prevent information from coming out. That is what what we are seeing happen again and again. I hope the Speaker does not find himself in court because of the decision he made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646913">As I mentioned, this debate would stop if the government would produce the unredacted documents. The question is, why has the government not produced them? I did not ask why it will not, because there is still the slimmest of hope that the government will do the right thing, the democratic thing, and produce the documents. I am not going to hold my breath, but I am hopeful that there is a slight possibility. We are still here and they can still act on it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646914">The public and all of us are wondering what the big deal is. Why will the Liberals not just do the the right thing, the appropriate thing, and produce the documents? Is it because the current government has grown long in the tooth, has run out of steam and is happy to let the parliamentary calendar waste away? It seems that way. We are on our third week and it does not seem very anxious to produce these documents. We want to get back to business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646916">
                <B>Mr. Marc Dalton:</B> Mr. Speaker, actually, we do not. That is a good point from the Liberals. We want to be working on business, but we do not like their business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646917">This goes to my second point. Maybe the Liberals have had visions in the night and subconsciously recognize that Canada is going in the wrong direction under their mismanagement. Maybe they are feeling a bit of collective shame in their hearts and saying, “We should really let this parliamentary calendar continue to ebb away, because our actions are destroying this nation.” If that is the case, then I have to commend them, kind of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646918">For example, maybe in that vision at night they saw how the per capita income of Canadians is going down under them. When I was an MLA in British Columbia, I would talk to people who would come to visit, even Americans. This was during the Harper years. At that time, it was a Conservative Parliament. They were just amazed at how well things were going in Canada compared with the United States, where the economy, the housing situation and everything was going downward and was in real distress, as opposed to what was happening here. There was a contrast between Canada and the United States with respect to how things were going under Stephen Harper, a Conservative prime minister, and what was happening in the United States. The Liberals have decided they do not want Americans to feel bad when they come up here and see that Canadians are doing so well, they want them to feel good, so they are going to destroy our nation economically. Our per capita income has gone down significantly. People are struggling financially to buy a home, so it is tough. Young people do not feel they are ever going to be able to buy a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646919">However, good news is on the way, and I hope we are going to see a Conservative government soon. Even today the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> announced an initiative that would remove the GST from all new housing built up to $1 million. That is about 5%. It is up to $50,000, not including the interest over the years, which could easily double or more than double the value. This is a common-sense approach to help young people and kick-start housing, which has been going down under the Liberals. We anticipate 30,000 new homes would be built every year under this initiative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646920">Our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has also announced our intention to encourage the provinces to remove the sales tax on all new housing production. When the Liberals came into power in October 2015, it took 39% of the median pre-tax household income to cover home ownership. What is it now? It is 60% of pre-tax income. Basically, it is people's full income and more. People are drowning. This is a measure that would generate new construction jobs, which is good news and stands in stark contrast to the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646921">In the vision of the night among the Liberals collectively, all the same night, miraculously, maybe they recognize that what they are doing is just making this country much less safe, which would be true. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, violent crime is up 50%, while violent gun crime has increased 116%. I am giving some numbers: 50% and 116%, but we are talking about tens of thousands of Canadians suffering under violent crimes and gun crimes, and people getting killed. It falls on the Liberals. A lot of it has to do with their policies, their legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646922">Therefore I am very happy to be debating the topic and not trying to either pass or oppose legislation that the Liberals bring forth in the House, because the majority of it, and I will not say “everything” because I am sure there must be one or two things that are decent but could be better, by far is not helpful to Canada. It is taking us down, dragging us down, so we are quite happy to take our time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646923">We would not have to be debating the privilege motion if the Liberals would just comply with the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s request and do the right thing, but their heels are dug in. Again, is it because of the collective pang of conscience that they recognize how bad their legislation is? The Liberals brag about banning firearms for law-abiding Canadians, while completely ignoring gun smuggling and the crime wave unleashed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646924">Police associations from across this country, last week or the week before, were forced to correct the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The Toronto Police Association, for instance, wrote to the Prime Minister, telling him, “Criminals did not get your message.” It went on to say, “Our communities are experiencing a 45% increase in shootings and a 62% increase in gun-related homicides compared to this time last year.” Things are getting chaotic, deadly and crazy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646925">The Toronto Police Association also said to the Liberals, “What difference does your handgun ban make when 85% of guns seized by our members can be sourced to the United States?” It does not make sense, but then we have come to expect that from from the Liberals, unfortunately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646926">The Toronto Police Association statement was followed by similar condemnations from the Vancouver Police Union and the Surrey Police Union. Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge, the riding I represent, is in British Columbia. The Vancouver Police Union wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, saying that the Liberals, who are really upheld by the NDP, are “not aware of the ongoing gang war here in B.C. which is putting both our members and public at risk on a daily basis." Addressing the Prime Minister, it said, “ Where do you think their guns are still coming from?” It is suggesting he should really think about it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646928">Maybe the Liberals recognize their incompetence, as is demonstrated by overdose deaths. Under the Liberals, there were 47,000 deaths, and many more are dying every day. I am wearing a poppy as we are approaching Remembrance Day. Tens of thousands of Canadians lost their lives on the battlefield, but there are actually many more who have died from the opioid crisis alone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646929">There are a staggering number of deaths due to the opioid crisis, and the Liberals are just making things worse and worse. They do not know what is going on. Maybe they want the current debate to continue because they realize they are making things worse. The opioid crisis is evidence of that. I have met many people who have lost loved ones. I have personally known people who have died from the crisis. It is a terrible situation here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646930">On Friday I was in my constituency office. The majority of the time when I go out the back door of my office, I see shattered people taking drugs and on fentanyl highs. On Friday, three times, just behind my office, ambulances had to come. There were people lying right in the middle of the parking lot. This is what has happened under nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, and it is a shame. It is terrible. There needs to be a change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646931">Maybe the reason the Liberals are letting this drag on is that it is for their pensions. I sure hope not; maybe it is just a comment, but we have to wonder why they are doing this. When millions of Canadians are struggling, I sure hope the reason the Liberals are not calling a carbon tax election is not their own paycheque as a cabinet minister, or for their pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646932">Maybe the reason the Liberals are not producing the documents and are just allowing the debate to go on and on is that they want to prorogue Parliament to try to reset things and deal with their internal chaos. This would be an opportune time to prorogue Parliament, to say they are not working well together and to have a leadership race.</ParaText>

Mark “carbon tax” Carney is waiting in the wings. Christy Clark has announced. The vultures are circling. No disrespect is meant to individuals; I am just saying that things are bleeding. I was reading today about Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Liberal minister of justice and attorney general of Canada. She said that the Prime Minister simply is not capable of self-reflection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646934">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> remains, not in the interest of Canadians and not even in the interest of my colleagues in the Liberal benches. He is not there for them. He is certainly not here for Canadians. It would appear that his interest is himself and the ability to jet-set around the world, hobnobbing with elites. That is what it would appear from here. From watching the news, I have a good idea that some of the members on the Liberal benches feel the same way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646935">I will introduce a teaser. Maybe I will get some questions on it. Maybe the Liberals really do have something to hide. I think that may be the reason. They do not want any more biopsies. They do not want the public to know how far the cancer has spread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646936">My wife had breast cancer. It has been nine years now. She had five operations. Doctors tested different lymph nodes to see whether it had metastasized. Thank God it had not. I am thankful she is here with me. She is a tremendous support. However, maybe the Liberals know that a cancer, which is what we are dealing with right now, has metastasized all throughout the government. It does not want the public to know.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647204"> Madam Speaker, my second petition notes that we are in both a climate and an affordability crisis, and that this crisis is exacerbated by oil and gas companies that are gouging Canadians at the pumps and making record-breaking profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647205">The petitioners note that the five largest oil and gas companies in Canada alone made $38 billion in 2022. They did it by gouging Canadians. They increased their profits by 18¢ a litre, from 26¢ a litre to around 42¢ a litre. They note that some folks talk a lot about the carbon tax. That went up around two cents a litre, while these profits went up 18¢ a litre. They also note that other countries around the world have put in place a windfall profit tax on the profits of oil and gas industries, where this has happened in other places around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647206">The petitioners have two very reasonable calls to action. They call on the Government of Canada to immediately put in place a 15% windfall profit tax on these excess profits and to reallocate the revenues generated toward programs that would make life more affordable for folks across the country, for example, by investing in improved service and more reliable public transit, and by investing in helping Canadians retrofit their homes.</ParaText>

I want to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>, for pulling together this petition, which is so important.

              <ParaText id="8647208">PFAS are man-made chemicals known to be resistant to heat, water and oil, but their durability comes at a significant cost. Scientific evidence links these substances to severe health risks, including cancer, putting firefighters who already face hazardous conditions at greater risk. Research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647209">Alarmingly, firefighters face a higher cancer risk than the general population. We must mitigate these risks by regulating what we can control in their working conditions. I just heard from Tofino Fire Department Chief McKeogh about the loss of a great legend in Tofino, George Hubert, because of cancer. He was a volunteer firefighter in our community for decades. I also heard about this from Port Alberni fire chief Mike Owens and his members.</ParaText>

The fifth reason is that I think they really have something to hide. The Auditor General put forward an audit that showed, I believe, that 186 out of 230 contracts she looked into had conflicts of interest. If we extrapolate that to all the contracts, it would equal about $800 million to Liberal insiders getting involved. It looks like even a cabinet minister had been involved in one capacity or another, actually several. We can compare that with the sponsorship scandal that happened 20 years ago. This is 10 times the amount, and that is just one scandal we are dealing with. It is right across the government. </ParaText>

It rests upon the NDP because it is an NDP-Liberal government. The NDP has actually supported the government; it has kept the Liberals in power through all the scandals and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. It rests on the NDP members, and so they have kept it. We have had non-confidence motions. They voted in favour of the government. Right now, they are allowing debate to go forward because they say they have to put a little separation between them and the Liberals, but the truth is, they vote for the Liberals constantly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647248">Madam Speaker, Liberal insiders are getting rich. That is what is happening here. This is what this all boils down to. I am often asked what is going on in Ottawa. Back in the riding, people want to discuss what it is truly like out here. In essence, the privilege motion we are debating today does just that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647249">An unfortunate series of events led us to this position. When asked by our constituents what is happening in Ottawa, we say that Liberal insiders are getting rich. In this case, $400 million in questionable spending has resulted in 186 conflicts of interest being identified so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647250">How are Liberal insiders getting rich? We have to go back to what this program was for, how it was set up and how the board was picked to see how Liberal insiders got rich. We have a program, the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, which should be helping Canadians to leave our environment better than it is today. It is for technology. It is for initiatives that could help green our economy and our country, which is a noble goal for one fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647251">However, as soon as the Liberals were elected in 2015, things changed. First, the Liberals changed the board. They also changed the chair of the board to an individual who, as the Auditor General has found, is in a conflict of interest. The actual chair of the board, who decides where all this money goes, was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Can we guess which companies she picked? They were her very own. That is Liberal insiders getting rich. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647252">It is not just the case of the chair of the board; we found conflicts of interest over 180 times, with the board of directors investing in companies for the environment. However, they were really doing it so the Liberals could get rich. We have seen this with the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, who is the owner of a company that got money. It is interesting to go through some of the details regarding who got rich, who owns shares and who owns some of these companies that got money. It is frustrating because the Auditor General found this; they found the corruption and the conflict of interest in these cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647253"> What happens when there is a crime? Do we call a meeting of local people to discuss that crime, or do we call the RCMP? This should be going to the RCMP. I am not the one saying this; many people have testified that it is questionable, regarding the different groups that got rich from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647254"> We are very grateful to the whistle-blowers out there. I thank the men and women who work in the public service for the work that they do and for doing what, I believe, is what is right for our society. The work that the bureaucrats do is administrating the wishes of the government. Therefore, when selecting a new board, the names would have been forwarded by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>; maybe there would have been some quick background checks and some procedural things to get the people on board. I am very grateful for these bureaucrats, who work tirelessly to make sure that Canada provides for its citizens as much as they need, and it is with the disdain of these people's views of what actually happened—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647261"> Madam Speaker, the SDTC program was set up to help Canadian companies and individuals with technology and programs related to the environment. It was set up to help meet the needs of the challenges we have with the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647262">One of the signature pieces of the Liberal platform was the environment. However, what happened when the Liberals got control, when they got keys to the bank and to SDTC? It did not take long. There were $400 million and 186 conflicts of interest. This is why we owe a debt of gratitude to whistle-blowers. This is the evidence that needs to be turned over to the RCMP. That is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647263">When people back in our constituencies, or anyone who is watching from Saskatoon—University right now, ask us what is going on, it is Liberal insiders getting rich. This is the prime example. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked board of the green slush fund has doled out over $400 million improperly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647264">I think of Jill who runs a cafeteria. She is an entrepreneur. I know how hard she works. I remember the conversation about some of the struggles she has had in the last few years and how hard she has to work to pay her employees, pay her rent and pay her taxes. I think about how much the average person earns in a year and how that person is forced to provide money to the government to go into programs like the green slush fund, that $400 million account. The government turned around and gave it to Liberal insiders, people on the board who had conflicts of interest. It is a crime that should be investigated by the RCMP. That is why we are seized with this debate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647265">There is an order of the House of Commons. The majority of members agreed that the evidence should go to the RCMP. The Liberals said that they would send the documents, but then blocked it all out. They redacted the details that were sent to the RCMP. It is a sad day in Canada when the federal government does not trust the RCMP. That is why we are here today. We want that evidence turned over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647266">Canadians should have a great deal of gratitude for some of the people who worked on this file, people who could not take the corruption, and they became whistle-blowers.

              <ParaText id="8647275">This is key. It is the old adage that sunlight is the best disinfectant. We should open up the books and jail the crooks if there are insiders getting rich on just this fund. This is $400 million, which is an eye-watering amount, but we should not forget all the pandemic spending. That is tens of billions of dollars and more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647276">This is where Canada finds itself right now. The current government has added more federal debt than all other prime ministers combined. This thing stinks. We are talking $400 million here and tens of billions of dollars of questionable contracts during COVID. This is like the 1990s again, but in the 1990s, it was cheap. The Liberals only stole $30-some million in the sponsorship scandal. This scandal alone is $400 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647277">Think of the good that we could do in our society with that money. Think of the two million people every month relying on the food bank to feed themselves. Think of the 1,400 encampments in the city of Toronto that could be helped. We could give people the dignity of a space until they get off the ground and onto their feet. That is what a government should be doing instead of making sure that Liberal insiders are getting paid. That is what has happening here. There is so much need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647278">I would like to talk briefly about why the SDTC was set up, which was for environmental initiatives in Canada. It is quite clear that the government pretends to care about the environment and that it wants fewer emissions. Meanwhile, we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who jet-sets anywhere in the world at a drop of a dime anytime he wants, and he does jet-set around the world. The carbon footprint and hypocrisy in that is outstanding. It is not like there is a need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647279">In a fund like this, I think of nuclear workers, especially in Ontario. If they are watching this, I know the Liberal government has insulted them, included them in sin stocks and ignored the importance of nuclear power. We are in Ontario and these lights are probably kept on right now by nuclear power. It's how our country, specifically Ontario, got off coal. Nuclear power is why we do not have smog days anymore in Toronto. I thank the men and women who work in the nuclear industry, which relates to this $400 million that went to Liberal insiders, the men and women who work on the refurbishment of the CANDU reactors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647280">Anyone who works in the supply chain for our reactors in Canada and around the world knows that AtkinsRéalis has a need for some federal support, especially with the MONARK reactor that it is trying to get off the ground. We would think this would be a perfect fit for the SDTC fund. It is a sustainable development technology. It is nuclear. It is what got Ontario off coal. It is what is delivering clean, affordable electricity to the people of Canada. It is technology, not taxes, that is going to solve the problem. It may have been mentioned before that it is technology, not taxes, but it is the men and women who work in the nuclear industry today and their technology. It has always been technology that has solved the challenges that we face as a country and as a society. </ParaText>

As a young boy, I was very concerned about acid rain. It was not a tax that fixed that problem, it was technology. A similar problem was the ozone layer and the hole that was being created in our atmosphere. It was technology, not taxes that fixed that problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647282">Once again, if we had a government, maybe a newly elected government with some common sense, it would take a program that is meant for environmental technology and take that fund and invest it in nuclear, which actually reduces emissions and helps our environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647283">The most frustrating thing about this is that the waste taking place could have actually solved some problems, especially in the environment. If AtkinsRéalis had had some support from the federal government, maybe the MONARK would be able to fly by now. However, it did not happen. Liberal insiders got rich. </ParaText>

This is wrong, and we know that. It is wrong that the companies of insiders, either board members or the chair of the fund itself, were funded.

The New Democrats pretend their coalition is over, but meanwhile they continue to support the government. They ripped up the agreement but then voted with the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647307">How much can we believe about anything the NDP says, when the evidence is in front of us about the fact that it is not really an opposition party? It is really just a satellite branch of the Liberal Party. Unfortunately, I think the NDP is going to find out shortly that voters have no time for the NDP-Liberals and what they have been up to, because the NDP is also implicated in the scandal. Let us remember that the current government, supported by the NDP, is the government that put $400 million into Liberal insiders' pockets instead of into important initiatives that could help our environment.</ParaText>

The fact that it changed its name to AtkinsRéalis does not change anything; it is the same corrupt corporation it was before. I certainly favour, and I wonder whether the hon. member for Saskatoon—University also favours, continuing an RCMP investigation into the ways in which SNC-Lavalin, now AtkinsRéalis, got away with the corruption in Libya and now continues to get hundreds of millions of dollars.</ParaText>

For the nuclear workers who are watching the debate today, people in the Liberal Party, maybe 75% of them, view nuclear in the same way the last speaker did. It is embarrassing that nuclear workers have been shunned by the Liberal government and by the Greens, who meanwhile are saying that we need to lower emissions, everyone has to do their part and everyone has to pay more tax.</ParaText>

For Liberals to stand up in the House and say the Conservatives are the ones delaying the business of the House could not be further from the truth. The Conservatives are here to keep the government accountable. An order was issued by the House, the Liberal government refused to heed that order and then the Speaker ruled in favour of the question of privilege. I do not know how much more clear it can be.

I served in the Alberta legislature, and I cannot imagine that any member of that legislature, given the almost eight years I served, would put up with the nonsense happening here with the government.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8647416"> Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the subamendment arising from the Speaker's ruling in finding a prima facie question of privilege following the failure of the Liberal government to abide by a clear and unambiguous order of the House that was passed on June 10 by a majority of members. In fact, all members representing all of the opposition parties collectively voted in support of the motion that led to the order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647417">The order is very straightforward. It simply calls upon the Liberals to turn over all documents under their control with respect to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, better known as the Prime Minister's billion-dollar green slush fund, to the Parliamentary law clerk so that the Parliamentary law clerk can then hand over those documents to the RCMP. The order provided that the documents were to be handed over unredacted, and it should be noted that the RCMP has confirmed that it is investigating conflicts, corruption and potential criminality at this billion-dollar green slush fund during the time that the former minister of industry Navdeep Bains and the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister of industry</Affiliation> oversaw that slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647418">I want to emphasize that the order of the House is not merely a request. It is not optional. It is not for the government to pick and choose which parts of the order it abides by and which parts it does not abide by. It is an order of the House that goes to the heart of parliamentary supremacy and the privileges of all members in the House. It is an order that has constitutional weight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647419">In that regard, I would draw attention to section 18 of the Constitution Act 1867, which states, “The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons, and by the members thereof respectively, shall be such as are from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada”. Among those privileges is the power of the House to call for persons, papers and records. Those powers are not in any way limited pursuant to the Standing Orders or any act or resolution passed by the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647420">According to Bosc and Gagnon, at page 984, “The result is a broad, absolute power that on the surface appears to be without restriction. There is no limit on the types of papers likely to be requested; the only prerequisite is that the papers exist in hard copy or electronic format, and that they are located in Canada.” That was reaffirmed by the parliamentary law clerk when he testified at the public accounts committee last Tuesday. He said, as quoted in the blues, with respect to the production order, “the power of the House to compel the production of documents is a constitutional power that is a parliamentary privilege. It supersedes ordinary law”. The parliamentary law clerk further observed that the privileges of the House, including the power to order the production of papers, records and persons, fall within the ability of this House of Parliament to exercise its core functions. Among those core functions is the ability to investigate and to hold the government to account. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647421"> That is precisely the basis of the production order, to see that Parliament can get to the bottom of the conflict, mismanagement and corruption with respect to the green slush fund and that those documents are turned over to the RCMP so it can pursue a criminal investigation and lay charges where appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647422"> As I noted, the order was passed on June 10. The government had 30 days to turn over the documents. It has not come close to complying with the order. It has turned over some documents, but they are redacted. When the representative from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the PCO, came before the public accounts committee, the bases upon which she asserted the redactions had been made were the Privacy Act, the Access to Information Act, solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. Of course, that is completely unacceptable because, as the law clerk noted, the production order supersedes all of those things. The parliamentary law clerk was clear. The order supersedes ordinary law, so it will prevail over the Access to Information Act, the Privacy Act and, for example, solicitor-client privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647423">Notwithstanding that, representing, again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the witness made it very clear that the government has no intention of abiding by the order of the House. The position of the government is to thumb its nose at Parliament. While thousands of documents have been redacted, tens of thousands of other pages of documents have been completely withheld. For example, the Department of Justice at present is withholding 11,000 pages of documents relating to SDTC. The justice department is hiding documents from the House that were ordered to be produced to the House and turned over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647424"> The government is in complete contempt. It begs this question: Why have the Liberals gone to such lengths to obstruct and literally paralyze this place to hide documents relating to the billion-dollar green slush fund? Having taken a fairly close look at what happened under the green slush fund, I think the answer is that it is really bad. That was confirmed by the explosive report of the Auditor General that led to this House adopting the motion that led to the production order the government has obstructed, three and a half months after the date it was due to turn over the documents. In that regard, the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, as well as former Liberal minister of industry Navdeep Bains, have a lot to answer for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647425">The Auditor General wrote that as much as 400 million taxpayer dollars may have gone out the door improperly at the green slush fund. The current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would have Canadians believe that SDTC, or the green slush fund, was an arm's-length foundation; that he and his officials really had nothing to do with it; and that when the whistle-blower came forward, he took action. However, that is not close to accurate with respect to what happened. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647426">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and his department had a responsibility to provide appropriate oversight of what was happening at SDTC, and the Auditor General concluded that such oversight was completely lacking. Indeed, the Auditor General found that $59 million went out the door of the green slush fund to ineligible projects. Putting aside the conflicts and the corruption that took place at SDTC, $59 million went out the door to ineligible projects. That is gross mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647427"> With respect to the responsibility of the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and his department for oversight, the Auditor General was scathing in her conclusions. There are entire sections on the failure of this minister and the previous Liberal minister. For instance, one heading on page 21 of the Auditor General's report says, “The department did not sufficiently assess whether the foundation complied with the contribution agreements”. The department did not sufficiently assess that. We are talking about a billion taxpayer dollars. The minister and his predecessor were not providing sufficient oversight. Another heading in the Auditor General's report says, “The department did not sufficiently assess and monitor the foundation and its use of public funds”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647428">That happened under this <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, and the previous minister, and he has a lot to answer for, about why there was that total and complete lack of oversight. He cannot run away from it. He cannot say it was just some arm's-length foundation. Yes, board members at SDTC bear responsibility, but ultimate responsibility rests with the current minister and his predecessor, Navdeep Bains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647429"> In addition to mismanagement, there were many conflicts of interest. There were instances of board members sitting in and deliberating on board meetings, and then voting to approve funding for projects that was then funnelled into companies they had interests in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647430"> One such board member was the Liberal hand-picked chair Annette Verschuren, who moved two motions to funnel money out the door under the guise of providing so-called COVID relief payments: $38.5 million went out the door that the Auditor General said should not have. Again, it was staggering mismanagement. However, $220,000 of that went into her company NRStor, a company in which she was the majority shareholder, founder and CEO. This was a total and blatant conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647431"> Then there was the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>'s pal Andrée-Lise Méthot. The Minister of the Environment was a lobbyist for Méthot's venture capital firm, Cycle Capital, lobbying the government almost 50 times prior to his election to this place. Méthot sat and voted to funnel $650,000 to companies she had interests in, as part of those COVID relief payments. Not only that, but she has admitted at committee that several of her companies received millions and millions of dollars from the green slush fund while she sat on the board.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647432">She was defiant in her testimony that she had recused herself and therefore, somehow, that was okay. However, when I asked her to explain if she had read the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act, and more specifically section 12, which states that “no director shall profit or gain any income or acquire any property from the Foundation or its activities”, she threatened to walk out of committee today, thumbing her nose at a parliamentary committee because that is precisely what she did. She violated the act when millions of dollars went into companies she had interests in. Whether she recused herself or not, the letter of the law in the SDTC act is clear. That was another matter flagged by the Auditor General in her report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647433">We have mismanagement to the tune of $59 million, we have millions of dollars that members funnelled into their companies that they had interests in and there are incidents worth millions more where members technically recused themselves but money went into companies they had interests in, in contravention of the SDTC act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647434"> It begs the question: Through it all, where was the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and where was his predecessor Navdeep Bains? At each and every one of the meetings during which those votes took place and money went out the door improperly or in conflicts of interest or in contravention of the SDTC act, the minister had a representative, the assistant deputy minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647435">One of two things is possible in the case of Navdeep Bains and the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>: they were completely asleep at the switch, or they turned a blind eye and were complicit in the mismanagement, conflict and corruption at SDTC. I have to say that I think the second scenario is the more likely scenario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647436">I and other members of the public accounts committee have questioned how it is that Navdeep Bains tapped Annette Verschuren on the shoulder to serve as chair of the green slush fund. Navdeep Bains claimed he appointed her pursuant to an independent merit-based process, but as it turns out, Navdeep Bains rigged the process by bypassing a short list provided by a selection committee and hand-picking Verschuren. Notwithstanding that he knew she had a conflict of interest, insofar as her company NRStor was receiving $12 million from the green slush fund at the time, Navdeep Bains appointed her anyway. When he came to committee, instead of answering basic questions, he obstructed the committee so much that the committee came very close to holding him in contempt. If he does not show up by this Wednesday, it is almost certain he will be held in contempt. It speaks to a government, a current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and a former minister who seem to be doing everything they can to not answer questions, to obstruct and to not be transparent. They have a lot to answer for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647437"> In the meantime, we are going to continue to insist, in the face of what is a massive scandal, that the government for once show some respect for this institution, show some respect for the taxpayers and show some commitment to seeing that there is accountability, including if there was criminal wrongdoing. The way the government can start in that regard, for the first time in nine years, is to turn over the documents now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647461"> Madam Speaker, it is an honour to speak today to this important motion. Sometimes it gets lost in this place when we are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars or a billion-dollar green slush fund. What does it all mean? I was thinking about that as I was driving to the airport this morning. I passed a Tim Hortons that had trucks lined up there. Construction workers were on their way to work hard all day, as well as a nurse who was commuting to the hospital to take on a shift in very hard circumstances. I drove by the many farms that line my riding of Fundy Royal. The farmers were up and at it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647462">This is a government that is all too happy to tax the hard-working Canadians who make this country what it is and make everything work. It taxes them when they earn income, it taxes them when they save and it taxes them when they spend. We can imagine how irate it makes overtaxed Canadians when they hear about this kind of waste, this kind of mismanagement and this kind of absolute corruption from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647463">Canadians are fed up after nine years of the Liberal government's corruption and, indeed, obstruction. This debate today is evidence of that. At the core of the issue being debated today is the hundreds of millions of dollars that was funnelled to connected Liberals on the board of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC. It has now become known as the Liberals' billion-dollar green slush fund. That is because the government turned the SDTC into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. There is no surprise there. During an investigation, the Auditor General was not given full access to documents in order to assess the full scope of corruption that had been taking place. In June, the House voted to call on the government to provide all relevant documents directly to the RCMP. That made abundant sense, but now the government is defying the will of this House. It is refusing to hand over documents after the public learned of hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars that ended up lining the pockets of Liberal-appointed board members. However, it gets even worse. Canadians did not know about the corruption that was taking place, but the Liberal government had been aware of the board's unethical practices for years. The government let it continue, regardless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647464">Canadians deserve accountability from their government. That is why this debate today is so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647465">SDTC was established in 2001 as a federally funded non-profit and for many years it carried out its mandate of helping Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies, so how did we get here? How are we in the mess that we are in today? When did the corruption and conflicts start to take root? It will be no surprise to anyone in this chamber that they started to take root under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647466">In 2018, the minister responsible for SDTC was former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains. He was not happy with the chair of the board at the time because the chair was publicly expressing concerns with government legislation. As we know, with a Liberal government, if there is one thing it cannot tolerate, it is any criticism of its actions. We all know that the Liberal government does not take criticism well at all. We know, first and foremost, that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not take criticism very well. That was fully evidenced this week as well. Thus, in 2019, the former industry minister began appointing new executives to the board of SDTC, despite the fact that many of these new executives had conflicts of interest. Therein is the root of the challenges that we are facing here now and exposing for Canadians. The minister went so far as to appoint a new chair of the board of directors who was already receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647467"> To be clear, I will say that SDTC had never had a chair with interest in companies that had been receiving funding until this point. However, the minister proceeded with this appointment despite being fully aware of this serious conflict of interest. We now have a chair of the board tasked with overseeing the very same funds her company was receiving. We do not need a degree in ethics to see that this is not right. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Privy Council Office were even warned of the risk associated with appointing a conflicted chair; however, no action was taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647468">The whole scandal is a sad reflection of what Canadians have come to expect from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We all know that he will do whatever suits him and his friends, regardless of right or wrong. We have seen this time and time again. I do not want to rehash all these things, but they are pretty instructive. Whether it is taking vacations on a billionaire's island, violating ethics; pressuring the Attorney General to look the other way when SNC-Lavalin was facing prosecution and, indeed, firing ministers just for doing their job; or trying to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to the WE Charity, despite conflicts of interest involving his own family, the entitled <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a track record of these kinds of actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647469">Greed, corruption and obstruction have become not just a pattern for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>; rather, they have become his playbook. As with any government, it is up to the Prime Minister to lead by example and to set the tone for his ministers as to how they should be expected to conduct themselves. The Liberals' green slush fund is just one example of how ministers have followed the Prime Minister's lead when it comes to disregarding rules around ethics and conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647470">In addition to appointing a chair of the board with an existing conflict of interest, former minister Bains appointed two board members who would go on to engage in behaviour in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act. They approved funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647471"> Canadians, the hard-working taxpayers that I mentioned at the start of my speech, know that we cannot have a situation where individuals are awarding contracts and funding to their own companies. This is so basic. It should go without saying, but we cannot take these kinds of things for granted with the current government. It is not rocket science. The board members' behaviour was obviously unethical and even contravened long-standing rules against conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647472">The Liberals did not intervene to stop the corruption. Instead, they allowed SDTC to enter into a five-year, $1-billion agreement with the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. It was around this time that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a new <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who still holds this role today. As his predecessor did, he would allow the SDTC to continue its unethical practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647473">Two years ago, whistle-blowers started to raise their concerns internally. The Privy Council Office, the top bureaucrats in the country who were tasked with assisting the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet, were briefed on the funnelling of taxpayer dollars to board members' own companies. It is so unfortunate, as is often the case with the government, that we have whistle-blowers putting their own careers on the line in order to expose the government's wrongdoings instead of having ministerial accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647474">Despite being well-informed of the misappropriation of funds and breaches of conflicts of interest, the Liberals still allowed the corruption to continue. In fact, it was not until September 2023 that SDTC's funding was finally suspended, nearly a full year after whistle-blowers first raised the alarm of possible corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647475">After years of the Liberals knowing exactly how board members were lining their own pockets, why did they decide to suspend SDTC's funding now? What had changed? Why, after all that time, was some action taken? It was not the unethical practices of the board, the hundreds of millions of dollars that went into their own companies or the disregard of conflicts of interest rules that ended up forcing the Liberals to suspend SDTC's funding. Rather, it was the fact that the whistle-blowers made their allegations public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647476">After inaction from the government over months made it clear that nothing was going to change, the whistle-blowers had to go public. That is the only reason any action was taken. Shortly after SDTC's funding was suspended, the Auditor General announced that she would be conducting an audit of SDTC to support parliamentarians in the oversight of government activities and the stewardship of public funds.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647477">While the Auditor General conducted this audit, Conservatives in the House of Commons worked to better understand the full scope of corruption that had been allowed to take place under the Liberal government and the amount of taxpayer dollars that were being misappropriated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647478">In February, after months of allegations of corruption, Canadians learned that multiple board members were under ethics investigations. In one case, we learned that a board member was placed under an ethics investigation for funnelling $400,000 through SDTC to a company that he owns. Another case was uncovered in which a former board member admitted to funnelling funds to a firm that they had a stake in. Another member of the board funnelled money to not one, not two, not three, but four companies that they had ownership stakes in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647479">Conservatives exposed the fact that the CEO and at least two directors used the fund to direct money to their own firms. The Liberal-appointed chair, a friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, confirmed that she used SDTC to give her own company more than $200,000 in grant money. After nine years under the Prime Minister, his government's policies have left Canadians with less money, while Liberal-appointed board members of his billion-dollar green slush fund took taxpayer' dollars to line their own pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647480">While Liberals are making off like bandits, everyday Canadians are struggling. We need only to look around us in all the communities we represent. Food bank usage has increased every year that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been in office. Members should think about what I just said. I know we throw this information out, but what a terrible track record for the Prime Minister. For the nine consecutive years that he has been Prime Minister, food bank usage has increased every single year. That is absolutely appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647481">Two million Canadians are now visiting food banks every month. According to Food Banks Canada, food bank visits have gone up 90% since 2019. The cost of housing has doubled under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and tent cities are popping up everywhere. In communities where tent cities were never a thing, they are everywhere. This was unthinkable just a few years ago, and it is now the norm across the country. In New Brunswick, in the riding I represent, and right across the country, we have tent cities in every city and in many communities throughout our great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647482">Why is this? Why is this happening under the government? Is it some great coincidence? No, Canadians know that this is a direct result of the oppressive actions that the government has been taking against taxpayers. As one example, the Liberal carbon tax has jacked up the cost of everything from home heating to gas and groceries; this makes a real difference in people's ability to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647483"> Every Canadian who goes grocery shopping would tell us that they have seen a remarkable increase in the cost of food. I know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would probably like to explain it as some kind of international phenomenon. The fact of the matter is that food prices have risen 36% faster here in Canada than in the U.S. over the last four years. What is the difference? It is the government's greedy carbon tax, which takes from those who are the least able to afford it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647484">Reckless spending under the government saw inflation reach a 40-year high. According to Statistics Canada, this country is currently faced with the biggest gap between rich and poor in our recorded history. While Canadians worried about how they would pay their bills, feed their kids and keep a roof over their head, Liberals worried about protecting their friends on the board of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647485">For months, Conservatives have been peeling back the shocking layers of corruption concerning the Liberals' billion-dollar green slush fund. In an effort to stop more damaging information from coming out, the Liberals and NDP members on the ethics committee tried to prevent a whistle-blower from sharing their testimony at committee. Hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars had been misappropriated, yet the NDP-Liberal coalition wanted to silence the whistle-blower, who had originally unveiled evidence of corruption and who courageously came forward with serious allegations while testifying at committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647486"> In June 2024, the Auditor General of Canada released her scathing report. After the Auditor General's analysis of how SDTC had been conducting its business became public, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> abolished the organization and transferred its funds to National Research Council Canada. This action by the industry minister is in stark contrast to how Liberals had previously approached the corruption going on, which was to do nothing and say nothing. After years of complacency, what was in the Auditor General's report that was so bad that the government was finally forced to act?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647487">First, the Auditor General found that SDTC had demonstrated significant lapses in governance and in stewardship of public funds. This was not just a serious allegation; it was backed up by volumes of evidence. Of the SDTC projects examined by the Auditor General, she found that nearly 20% of the funding went to companies that were ineligible to receive it. The projects did not meet the government's own criteria for funds but were approved anyway. The ineligible projects received over $58 million of hard-working taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647488">The Auditor General was given a sample of 226 transactions to examine for the purpose of the audit, and 82% of the transactions were conflicted. This was not a one-off. It was not just a slight deviation from the norm; 82% had conflicts. The price tag of the conflicted transactions totalled $330 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647489">The Auditor General's investigation uncovered $390 million in funding that was awarded to projects that were either ineligible to receive funding or were awarded to projects in which board members were conflicted. This is not just a scandal of epic proportions; this is pure, unbridled corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647490">Following the release of the Auditor General's report, the House passed a motion calling on the government, SDTC and the Auditor General to send all documents related to the Liberals' billion-dollar green slush fund directly to the RCMP. Instead of abiding by the will of the House, federal departments either outright refused the order or turned over documents that were heavily redacted, citing provisions of the Privacy Act or the Access to Information Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647491">The problem is that neither the Privacy Act nor the Access to Information Act permits federal departments to redact documents that have been specifically requested by the House. The House has the absolute and unfettered ability to order the production of documents, which is not limited by statute. These are powers enshrined in the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647492">The government's reaction to the motion as passed by the House has been absolutely unacceptable. In fact, the government's response went so far as to breach the privileges of the House. The <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> raised these concerns as a question of privilege last month, and the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> agreed to look into the facts of the case that Conservatives had laid out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647493">After examining the events that had transpired, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> ruled that the privileges of the House had in fact been breached. The Speaker's ruling on the question of privilege has led us to the debate we are having today. The debate is about more than just respect for Parliament; it is also about respect for democracy and about accountability to taxpayers and our constituents, who send us here to Ottawa to work on their behalf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647494">The government is doing everything it can to withhold the documents, so it begs the question of what the Liberals are trying to hide. They are willing to sacrifice their entire legislative agenda rather than simply comply with the will of Parliament and hand the documents over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647495">The Liberals must have weighed the pros and cons of the situation and decided it was more important to withhold the documents than it was to do the work their constituents elected them to do. The Liberals have no one to blame but themselves. They can choose to respect the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling and the will of the House, or they can continue to obstruct the work of Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647508"> Madam Speaker, that is why, at the outset of my remarks, I mentioned the farmers and nurses in my riding, as well as the construction workers I saw going off to work this morning when I was on my way here. It is easy for us in the House to talk about hundreds of thousands of dollars misappropriated to an individual's company or $390 million over a number of cases where the money should not have been awarded because of a conflict of interest or ineligibility. However, where did that money come from? There is only one source for all this money, and that is the taxpayers whom we all represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647509">Taxpayers work hard for their money. When they earn that money, they are taxed on it; when they spend that money, they are taxed on it. They deserve, from each and every one of us in this chamber, absolute accountability for the money that has been spent. However, accountability is what the government, at every turn, has sought to avoid under the green slush fund. It hurts the Liberals very badly that we are not going to stand for that. Conservatives are going to expose that every day. </ParaText>

The former law clerk of the House of Commons has said that he does not support the tactic.

              <ParaText id="8647513">This is not from me. It is the Auditor General of Canada who said that 20% of the projects were ineligible and $58 million was sent for ineligible projects. Out of 226 transactions examined for the audit, 82% were conflicted. The price tag of these conflicted transactions was $330 million. Members do not have to take the Conservatives' word for it; this is directly from the Auditor General, and that is an inconvenient truth for the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647518"> Madam Speaker, I should not say it is a pleasure to still be debating this privilege motion, because it is very unfortunate. We are now on a subamendment, which I would like to share my views on with the House today, but I should remind members of the government caucus that their refusal to comply with a lawful order of Parliament, with a lawful production order, is the reason the House is still debating this motion. The Liberals control 100% of what business will be debated in the House. All they have to do is comply with the production order, and then they can call whatever piece of legislation they want. However, we are still talking about this because they would rather grind Parliament to a halt for three or four weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647519">I think we started debating this motion on September 27. Was it September 27?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647520">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> It was the 26th.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647521">
                <B>Hon. Andrew Scheer:</B> Madam Speaker, I am off by a day, September 26. It is now October 28. They have paralyzed Parliament for a month rather than simply complying with the production order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647522">What is a production order? For those watching on CPAC who want to know the intricacies of this parliamentary word, I note that Parliament has the power to compel every government agency, institution or department to produce information. To do our jobs and make good laws and sound decisions, we have the ability collectively, when the House decides that it needs documents or wants to hear testimony from witnesses, to send for persons or papers. We are talking about papers right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647523">We have uncovered, thanks to brave testimony from whistle-blowers who unveiled the depths of this corruption at great risk to their own careers, that Liberal-friendly insiders sitting on a board, who had control of a billion dollars' worth of taxpayers' money, got to determine who got millions of dollars' worth of government grants. What the Auditor General found out, thanks to the tipoff by this whistle-blower and thanks to my hard-working colleagues sitting on the committee that litigated this scandal, is that insiders were funnelling taxpayers' money into their own companies, which is outrageous. It was 400 million dollars' worth of corruption. The Auditor General found that $58 million went to 10 projects that were completely ineligible and had nothing to do with the mandate of the fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647524">The fund was originally set up to help Canadian companies innovate and find solutions to environmental problems. The government would help underwrite some of the costs of innovation. The thinking was that, as a benefit, Canadians would perhaps get the commercialization of whatever innovative products came out of that. Then of course there was the environmental benefit of having cleaner ways to do things and make things, fewer emissions going into our atmosphere and fewer pollutants going into our lakes and rivers. The key point was that it had to have something to do with the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647525"> The Auditor General found that 10 projects for $58 million were completely ineligible. That is a lot of money. Just to put that into context, the sponsorship scandal started off at about $40 million and people went to jail for it. There were criminal prosecutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647526">I should point something out to my hon. colleague from Winnipeg, because I anticipate that he might get up. Every once in a while he likes to get up for questions and comments to make his views known and to ask Conservatives for their take on some of the things he is interested in. He will somehow paint the spectre that as long as Parliament is doing anything with this, there should be a complete, pristine cone of silence around any kind of investigation. I will point out to him that there was a lot of investigation into the sponsorship scandal. In fact, there was a full public inquiry, a judicial inquiry, called the Gomery commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647527">I was in the House at the time. I remember the daily drip of details that came out, the sordid facts of Liberal insiders and even Liberal cabinet ministers at the time who were sitting around the table when a scheme was concocted. It was to take money that was supposed to protect our national unity and spread the message of a cohesive and strong country and to instead put it into the pockets of Liberal insiders. It was very similar.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647528">The inquiry, the debate in Parliament and the litigation at committee did not prevent the RCMP from successfully prosecuting and convicting wrongdoers in that case. I just want the member to know that; it might save him some time when my speech is concluded. Hope springs eternal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647529">We found out more. I do not have it printed out, but I have it. One of my colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, found out something today about the owner of Cycle Capital, which by the way is the same firm that the current <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> is involved in. A lot of people say there were Liberal insiders on the board and ask what the link is to Liberal ministers and the government of the day. Here it is: The Minister of Environment is a partial owner in the company called Cycle Capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647530">Annette Verschuren's company was valued at $140 million when she was appointed to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s slush fund. After years of funnelling millions in taxpayers' money to companies she owns, Cycle Capital is now worth $600 million. This is exactly like GC Strategies. It is never better than when Liberals are in power, for government lobbyists and well-connected Liberal insiders. That is why Canadians should care about the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647531">Let us think back to when Canadians were locked down, the economy was suffering and many people were going through severe hardship. Think about all the devastating impacts that had on the lives of Canadians. All members know of people in their communities who lost everything. They lost their businesses, sometimes businesses that had been in the family for two, three, four generations. People had to sell their home, families were broken up and people had to move to other parts of the country to find work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647532">Some of the redirection of money, the misuse of taxpayers' money, was happening during that time, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was saying that he was plunging the country into debt so Canadians did not have to go into debt. We should never forget that during that incredible time of hardship, Liberals got a Liberal. They found a way to enrich their friends and help their partisan supporters. That is the crux of the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647533">This could all end today. Every once in a while, I chat with a Liberal member in the hallways of this place, and they ask me how long the debate is going to go on for. The ball is in the Liberals' court. It will end on the day they respect the order of Parliament, the day they direct all their departments to comply with the lawful order of Parliament so the information can be handed to the RCMP and the RCMP can have all the information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647534">The Auditor General has the “follow the money trail” kind of thing. She has the documents about where money was paid and how decisions were made, and she understands the conflicts of interest. However, there is a lot of information behind the scenes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647535">A whistle-blower said that with respect to intent, when one has the information that is contained in the production order, they will see the intent. We believe that, at the very least, the RCMP should be able to access the documents so it can make the proper determination. It is a very important principle that we, as the guardians of taxpayers' money, are able to let it do that. That is why the motion is so important, and that is why it is so important for the government to comply with the order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647536">I should point out another argument that I anticipate. I hope I addressed an issue that the member might have gotten up on, but just to give him some rest and maybe to avoid having to answer another question about it, I will add this: He might also say that there is somehow some terrible precedent being set and that complying with the production order would somehow taint the investigation and create a terrible precedent for future cases. I should point out that some departments have complied with the order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647537"> In fact, I believe the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has complied with the production order. Some departments did provide documents, so the Liberals cannot on the one hand claim they cannot comply with the order because doing so would taint the criminal investigation, which is some bizarre argument about violation of charter rights. I should point out that the charter is not there to protect the government; it is there to protect the people from the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647538">The government cannot have it both ways. It cannot go ahead and say that it is somehow going to damage the integrity of the RCMP investigation while simultaneously some departments are complying with it. Those two arguments are mutually exclusive. Only one of those scenarios can be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647539"> We believe that some departments did the right thing and complied with it. Some departments decided to ignore a lawfully passed production order by the elected body of the people of Canada, whose money, by the way, was taken out of their pockets or off their paycheques to go into this fund that was then redirected to these Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647540">For that reason, I hope that today, after a month of Parliament not being able to proceed to other business because the government has chosen to paralyze Parliament rather than comply with this order, might be the day the Liberals all go home, reflect on what was said today and wake up tomorrow with a renewed sense of democracy and of proper stewardship of taxpayer money. That is my hope. It is not just a hope for myself and my Liberal colleagues, but for the Canadian people, so they can once again have faith and confidence in their institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647541">The member talks a lot about institutions and preserving the integrity of those institutions. How about preserving the integrity of the institution of Parliament? How about restoring the integrity of the concept that taxpayer money is used properly and that the government does not reach into the pockets of Canadians through the use of its monopoly on force? Nobody has the choice as to whether or not they pay their taxes. The government has that awesome power to force people to fork over when it decides to make them fork over. At the very least, what should accompany that is the money that is raised in that way only goes to what the government says it is supposed to go to and not to enriching the well-connected partisan friends of the Liberal Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647542">We are almost at the end of today's session. Let us all take that hope home with us, reflect on that tonight and send positive energy or say prayers that we will all wake up tomorrow, or at least the Liberals will all wake up tomorrow, with a bit more wisdom, a little more respect for the Canadian taxpayers and comply with this production order so the RCMP can get to the bottom of this sordid affair. </ParaText>

Hopefully, the member opposite will understand why I would rather not take advice from the Conservatives. After all, what they are suggesting is that there is nothing wrong with the production of papers and that all we have to do is get the information and hand it directly over to the RCMP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647545">Here is a quote I would like to provide the member opposite from Mike Duheme, “There is significant risk that the Motion could be interpreted as a circumvention of normal investigative processes and Charter protections.” That is not me, the Liberal Party or the government saying it, but the RCMP commissioner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647546">That was reinforced in different ways by the Auditor General of Canada and by the former law clerk of the House of Commons. This is something the Conservative Party completely ignores, so when the member talks about a lack of respect for the institution, the Conservative members need to look in a mirror.

              <ParaText id="8647549">I want to go back to something my colleague from New Brunswick said in response to my question. Why are we here today debating this motion? The government party has a whole bunch of people who sit around the cabinet table. I am not sure how big cabinet has expanded to these days, but a lot of people sitting around the cabinet table were aware of what was going on. They did nothing. Not only did they do nothing; they tried to sweep it under the rug. The whistle-blower had to come to committee to testify because all of his efforts to get the due diligence and the proper oversight and scrutiny fell on deaf ears. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647550">What can be so problematic with complying with a production order if several departments have already complied? Again, and I had hoped that I had pre-emptively addressed this, that is the hypocrisy of the member's position. When many departments have fully complied but many have not, then the argument cannot be made that any compliance with it will somehow taint the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647551"> At the end of the day, if we go back to that beginning point, had the Liberal government members done their due diligence, they would have said, “Wait a second. These people we appointed to the board were doing something wrong; they were funnelling money into their own companies and they placed themselves in conflict of interest.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647552"> The members of the board had this scheme where one person would leave the room, the rest of them would vote in favour of the funding going to that person, and then that person would come back in the room and do it for their friends. If the Liberals had said, “Whoa, that does not fly. We are calling in the cops; we are handing them all the information”, we would not be here today. However, they did not, because those people on the board making those decisions and funnelling that money were their partisan friends and supporters.

              <ParaText id="8647565">It all comes back to the “who made who” type of thing, so let us go all the way back. Corruption happened at SDTC. Liberal insiders lined the pockets of their own companies, knowingly putting themselves in conflict of interest positions. One of the board members actually ran away from a Zoom call.

              <ParaText id="8647567"> As the details came out at committee, the Liberals continued to filibuster and stonewall to try to prevent Canadians and parliamentarians from knowing what happened.

              <ParaText id="8647583"> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for being attentive, but when I speak, there are usually lots of people in the House. It is not usually a problem for me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647584">Let us get back to the matter at hand. There are lots of technical terms, legal linguistic terms and acronyms, such as SDTC, that we can utilize. Of course, there are different names. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647585">What we need to understand is that there was a pool of nearly a billion dollars that was established by the Liberal government. The government then entrusted this money to a group of individuals who came under the auspices of SDTC, the then minister Navdeep Bains and eventually the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation</Affiliation>. SDTC was given this billion dollars and told what the government wanted SDTC to do with it. What the government was selling to the Canadian public was that this money would be used to get a cleaner, greener, more efficient and more productive economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647586">Let us not forget where that billion dollars came from. It came from single moms, seniors, high school kids and folks working two or three jobs trying to get by in this ever-diminishing Liberal economy. One might say we would get this money from the wealthy, but that is not the reality. A large portion of Canadian tax dollars comes from the most vulnerable and, in fact, the poorest of our society. For example, people would probably be shocked to know that, with clawbacks and taxation, there can be folks earning less than $40,000 a year but paying more than 70% of their dollars to clawbacks and income tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647587">The government is taking this money from people who are struggling to get by every day, to get that last meal of the month. The government is taking millions of dollars. In fact, as I said, it was $1 billion. The taxpayers do not get a choice as to whether they pay. Either people pay or they go to jail. The government took a billion dollars in hard-earned tax dollars, taken under a threat of force. What did the government do with it? It told the Canadian public that it would make the environment clean and more efficient. It said that it would make the economy more productive and get patents and intellectual property that would grow our economy. Nothing could be further from the truth of what actually happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647588">In this cabal of individuals, we saw $58 million given to 10 ineligible proposals. This means that these proposals did not fit the criteria. Once again, there is that billion dollars, which had rules attached to it. There was an agreement on how that money was going to be spent because it came from all those hard-working Canadian taxpayers. SDTC decided which people it was going to give the money to. What has been found so far is that it flagrantly disregarded those criteria with 10 proposals. There were $58 million that went out the door for things that did not fit the criteria of making the economy cleaner, greener, more efficient or more productive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647589">The question of whom SDTC gave this $58 million to needs to be asked, as well as why it did that. This is what I will talk about in the latter part of the story. There were also 186 cases in which board members held a conflict of interest. We will get back to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647590">There was a group of individuals in charge of this billion dollars. As I said, it was to get a more efficient economy. It would make sense that it was not there to benefit this group of individuals. We do not need complex conflict of interest regulations or policies; if a billion dollars is given to grow the economy, one would just assume that the money is not going back to the people who are deciding where that money is going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647591">I will say that again. One would presume that billion dollars would not be going back to the individuals who are deciding where the money is going. Obviously, they are not going to be objective, and this creates the opportunity for corruption. Clearly, we have seen some things Canadians would not be proud of. There was millions more given to parties that did not perform the contracts. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647592">The way it works is that there are tranches of money that are given out. Usually, certainly in the private sector, if someone does not meet certain criteria, and “specific performance” is the legal term, then the rest of the money is not given to them. In the case in question, however, the money kept flowing and flowing. We have seen so far that millions of dollars of the billion-dollar pot was given out either where there were conflicts of interest or where contracts were clearly ineligible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647593"> What is it that Conservatives asked for in the privilege motion? What did we possibly ask that is trampling the rights of the charter, interfering with a police investigation, or other red herrings the parliamentary clerk has said are not the case? In fact, the people through their representatives have the ultimate and unfettered right to ask for any documents they require. What is the awful step we have taken? We have just asked for documents. At the end of the day, we want more information to find out what went on so the RCMP can proceed with its investigation, unimpeded by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647594">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> might say that we should just let the RCMP decide, and that would be well and good if what I am going to describe had not happened, which is a series of different scandals that have occurred over the last nine years. This forms the context as to why Conservatives feel it is important that we help get the documents across the way to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647595">We have to go back to December 2017, when, just two years after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected, Canada's Ethics Commissioner ruled that the Prime Minister had broken the conflict of interest rules by accepting vacations, gifts and flights in 2016. He had been elected less than a year before and had already started a pattern of corruption. It was the first time a prime minister had ever been found guilty of such a transgression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647596">There have been a number of things between then and now. Clam scam was in there as well, and a number of other scandals, but we will just jump forward and hit some of the highlights of the corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647597">In February 2019, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould accused the government of inappropriately pressuring her to help construction giant SNC-Lavalin avoid a corruption trial. Public works minister Jane Philpott also quit, citing loss of confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The Ethics Commissioner ruled that the Prime Minister and officials had breached ethics rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647598">In 2020, there was one of the larger scandals, and there are quite a few. It was another nearly billion-dollar scandal, with the WE Charity. Of course, with the WE Charity, the government took the opportunity, just like with SDTC, of the cloak of COVID in order to promote its corrupt agenda, which included a $912-million program that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised as part of a $9-billion COVID-19 financial aid program for post-secondary students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647599">Shortly after, the Liberal government announced it was awarding the sole-source contract to WE Charity, and it came to light that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family had a connection there. Once again, underneath the cloak of COVID, the government took the opportunity to stuff the pockets of Liberal insiders full of hard-earned Canadian taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647600">We go on with the scandals. We jump forward to a more recent one, the arrive scam scandal. It came out on February 12, 2024, with the Auditor General's report in which she said that there were so many dollars spent and the bookkeeping was so bad that it is impossible for anyone, including the Auditor General, to know exactly how much money was wasted on arrive scam.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647601"> Just so everyone remembers, ArriveCAN was an app that IT professionals said could have been designed and completed in a weekend for a quarter of a million dollars. In fact, because the bookkeeping was so bad, they could not even determine exactly how many resources were dedicated to the creation of the ArriveCAN app. Estimates put it at least $60 million. It resulted in a single update sending 10,000 Canadians to quarantine despite doing everything right. It resulted in a massive scandal involving dozens of senior officials in the public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647602">As I said, it should have cost a quarter of a million dollars. Instead, it ended up costing $60 million. The app had numerous other issues. An interesting one, in terms of corruption, is that after so many self-inflicted issues with the Ethics Commissioner, the Liberals attempted to appoint the sister-in-law of the <Affiliation DbId="278102" Type="2">minister of public safety</Affiliation> as the interim Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647603">I wonder what the Thanksgiving or Christmas dinners would look like. They would be sitting there having turkey, discussing how the grandkids are, saying they are great, and what about that little ethics violation we had there? We will be able to take care of that over a couple wings of turkey and pass the cranberries and eliminate the corruption, please.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647604">Of course, in May 2022, the Ethics Commissioner opened up an investigation into the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">minister of international trade</Affiliation>'s conduct from spring 2020, involving approximately $17,000 in a contract for media training given to a company co-founded by a Liberal strategist. The commissioner determined the minister broke the rules for refusing to recuse herself from the process that led to the decision to award the contract to a public relations firm due to her nearly 20-year friendship with the firm's co-founder. In that one, we had a Liberal consultant who was getting onto the payroll for media training for $17,000. The Ethics Commissioner found that broke the rules, but that should be no surprise to anyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647605">Here is an interesting one, given that the themes of today seem to involve foreign interference. I would remind the member from <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> about this. It became well known that the Communist regime in Beijing used donations to the Trudeau Foundation to attempt to influence the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647606">Information published by La Presse and The Globe and Mail raised even more concerns about the $200,000 donation directed by Beijing. The foundation misled Canadians when it said the controversial donation made by two Chinese businessmen qualified as a Canadian donation. Testifying before the House of Commons ethics committee, Pascale Fournier said her predecessor, Morris Rosenberg, told the National Post in December 2016 that the foundation did not consider the donation to be foreign money because it was made by a company incorporated in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647607">We see over and over again, from the sponsorship scandal on out, this culture of entitlement and of corruption, where when times are tough for Canadians, when that single mom is desperately working that extra overtime shift just to make sure she has enough money to pay for her son's hockey, or her daughter's soccer, the government members take the opportunity to stuff their jeans full of as much cash as they can. In this case, it was underneath the cloak of COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647608">One has to remember that, actually, if not for the Conservatives, during COVID, if we can believe this, the then finance minister, Bill Morneau, came to this place and tried to sneak in a piece of legislation. Because of COVID, we were moving quickly, and we were working largely in good faith and consensus. He tried to sneak in that the government could spend as much money as it wanted for whatever it wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647609">If not for our current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, the then finance critic, that would have gone through. We are hearing so far, in these recent days, we have SDTC that is good for a billion dollars of corruption. We have the WE scandal that is a billion dollars worth of corruption. That is just what we have found so far, and there are more Auditor General reports to come.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8647610"> There has been, over the last week or two, a lot of use of the word “reflection”. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the cabinet may be immune to this reflection. It appears that when he has important decisions, the Prime Minister's max reflection time is about 18 hours or so. However, I would hope the Liberal members back there would have some reflection on what their government has become, including a leader who is clearly unpopular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647611">There is a reason they are cruising toward single digits in the polls. There is a reason that, when I walk and talk with my constituents, the number one question is: “When is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> leaving, and can we help him pack his bags?” That is what I hear, and not just from Conservative voters but also from some folks who I know have never voted for me and are lifelong Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647612">At a certain point in the life of a caucus, members have to stand up for their principles and beliefs. They have to decide if power is really worth it. Is power worth $1 billion in corruption through SDTC? Is it worth having $1 billion taken from hard-working Canadians and an attempt to have it given to WE Charity? Is it worth supporting a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is habitually convicted by the Ethics Commissioner for ethics violation? Is power really worth it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647613">We are asking for something entirely reasonable. We are asking for documents to be handed over to the RCMP. Some government offices have already complied, so we know it is possible. We are hoping that reflection comes to folks as they think about their hard-working constituents who, just like my constituents in the great riding of Northumberland—Peterborough South, are working day and night to get by and are giving, sometimes, 60%, 70%, 80% of their paycheques to the government.

              <ParaText id="8647635">Madam Speaker, I am back tonight to continue to raise the alarm on the impacts of the poisoned drug crisis on my community and, specifically tonight, on the federal funds that are needed to act. The reality is that, in my community, this crisis continues to have devastating impacts. This year alone, there were 72 more deaths from poisoned drugs. In fact, just in the period from October 11 to October 21, earlier this month, there were five more suspected poisoned drug deaths, each one a loved member of my community, such as Alby, who I spoke about in the House recently, or my friend Hudeyfa, who passed away earlier this year. Every single one was a preventable death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647636">In the midst of this crisis, the federal government has a program specifically for prevention, harm reduction and treatment initiatives. It is called the substance use and addictions program, or SUAP for short. It is a $359-million program. There is good news for the government: We have two experienced, credible organizations who applied for this very fund from Waterloo region, Sanguen and Community Healthcaring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647637">Sanguen has even been funded by SUAP before. I was thrilled to join the then minister of mental health and addictions, our former colleague Carolyn Bennett, alongside my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278775" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> last year, to announce a previous extension of SUAP funding for Sanguen's community health van, yet this year, for both applications from Waterloo region, neither one was successful, meaning that zero SUAP dollars are going to Waterloo region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647638">Even if we received just the average across the country, in recent years program funding varied between $104 million to $145 million a year. If we were to average that out across the five ridings across Waterloo region, it would mean between $1.5 million to $2 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647639">This is at a time when we need more of everything in the face of this poisoned drug crisis: more treatment, more mental health supports, more safe consumption sites, more safer supply and more harm reduction. Instead, both provincially and now federally as well, our community is actually getting less. This is why I met with the <Affiliation DbId="300007" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and her team when we began to hear news of these funding decisions back in July.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647640">The best they can do is talk about a new fund being set up that non-profits and charities in my community, and others across the country, will not even be eligible for, with a hope that more money might get announced in the future. That means that organizations such as Sanguen and Community Healthcaring are going to have to begin to wind down programs by March 31 of next year if nothing more is done, at a time when we need them doing more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647641">The other reality, though, is that, beyond those two organizations, what we need is SUAP money, not words of aspiration, to be delivered to communities like mine.</ParaText>

This pain ripples through society, leaving grieving families and communities struggling to heal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647645">Since 2017, we have committed over $1.2 billion to support access to evidence-based prevention, treatment and harm reduction services. We have also supported research and consolidated enforcement activities to combat the production and trafficking of illicit drugs. We have invested more than $650 million in over 420 projects through Health Canada's substance use and addictions program, or SUAP. For example, more than $15.5 million has been allocated to projects in my colleague's community of Kitchener—Waterloo. Across the country, community organizations are working tirelessly to reduce stigma and provide much-needed support to people who use substances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647646">In line with our ongoing commitment under budget 2023 to fight the overdose crisis, we have allocated $144 million to fund more evidence-based community supports and health interventions following a national call for proposals through SUAP. The initiative generated a lot of interest. In all, close to 700 proposals were submitted and over $2 billion in funding was requested. These proposals were carefully reviewed. The successful proponents were selected based on their ability to implement innovative, community-led projects that are viable and that could eventually be scaled up. The unprecedented number of applications received highlights the severity of the overdose crisis in communities across the country, and confirms that our work is far from done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647647">Together, we will continue to make the health and well-being of all Canadians a priority and to fight this crisis. Now, we are announcing $150 million over three years as of 2024-25 to implement an emergency treatment fund for municipalities and indigenous communities. This fund will make it possible to quickly respond to urgent needs related to the overdose crisis, increase links to treatments and expand harm reduction services across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647648">These investments reflect our commitment to making the health and well-being of all Canadians a priority. We will continue to work with our partners to effectively address this crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647664"> I am thankful for the opportunity to rise in the House this evening to speak to the positive benefits offered by Correctional Service Canada's employment and employability program. Employment programs and services help build essential skills related to employment while connecting offenders with resources that assist them with finding community employment after release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647665">The benefits associated with correctional programming have long been demonstrated. In fact, going back a decade, research has noted a direct impact between employment and positive reintegration results upon release. We know that inmates who participate in CORCAN employment programs while incarcerated are more likely to be granted parole. Similarly, inmates who participate in CORCAN employment programs while incarcerated are more likely to get a job in the community. Also, offenders under community supervision who find employment in the community have reduced recidivism rates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647666"> Without the holistic approach of the CORCAN offender employment and employability program, offering a diverse range of correctional interventions and services over the course of their sentence, offenders would not be as well positioned to find employment. As research has demonstrated, programming works to build safer communities for all Canadians to enjoy by providing them with the skills necessary to safely adapt to life upon release. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647667">That is not the only benefit to Canadians. Additionally, community programming works to save Canadians money. The daily cost of maintaining an inmate in prison amounts to six figures annually. When an inmate can be safely returned to the community and find employment, they are working to financially support themselves, are required to pay taxes and are no longer incurring six figures to the Canadian public. That is why I am happy to note that there has been a year-over-year increase in opportunities for inmates to undertake CSC programming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647668"> In fiscal year 2023-24, employment coordinators, including staff and contractors, directly assisted offenders under community supervision to obtain 2,441 community job placements. In 2023-24, on-the-job training opportunities were provided to 2,624 offenders, within one of CORCAN's five business lines. I am proud to note that a total of 22,300 vocational training certificates were earned by inmates of all backgrounds in 2023-24, representing an increase of 5,855 from the previous year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647669">Throughout the apprenticeship program, offenders have the opportunity to register, accumulate hours and take block training to become Red Seal journeymen in a specific trade. Since September 2020, a total of 201 offenders participated in apprenticeship programs, of whom 68 have completed certification, with many more continuing to work toward it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647670">It has been alleged that vocational certificates offered to inmates are meaningless participation awards. This is an unfair characterization considering the nature of Correctional Service Canada's agreements and partnerships for vocational training and employment services. For example, CSC forms partnerships directly with indigenous communities to further increase project availability, and they provide indigenous offenders with additional on-the-job training opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647671">CSC works with provincial trade associations to track apprenticeship hours in a number of different trades. It also works directly with colleges and universities, as well as private industries that provide established curricula to provide vocational training to offenders. These curricula are also offered to Canadians coast to coast and in the ridings that we represent in a number of different trades and jobs. I am— </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647673"> Madam Speaker, I hope the parliamentary secretary will understand my point when I note that one of the numbers he cited makes the whole point here: 68 inmates have completed Red Seal certificates since 2021. That is in three years. That is 22 or 23 per year, which is not much in a country with thousands of inmates. It points to the problem that the reports I was citing get at. Our programs are vastly inadequate, whether in scope, which would be the problem going on here, or perhaps in direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647674"> I would make the suggestion that we could benefit from, perhaps more than anything else, looking at the successes that have occurred in other systems. There are many other penal systems, most of which attempt some form of retraining inmates for re-entry into the community. Some of them, no doubt, are worse than ours. Many, I suspect, are better.

              <ParaText id="8647676">Madam Speaker, as stated, correctional interventions work to provide meaningful employment and employability program opportunities for offenders, increasing the likelihood of safe and successful reintegration. As part of this, CSC works with partners in the academic, private and not-for-profit sectors to access learning materials that mirror those available to the general public and to develop courses in line with community employment standards. The resulting vocational certificates are issued, in most cases, by the third party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647677"> The collaboration between CSC and existing partners provides offenders with the support, referrals and services to address their employment needs and contributes to offenders' ability to find and maintain employment in the community. Research clearly demonstrates that offenders who are employed in the community are less likely to reoffend or return to federal custody. This benefits offenders by providing them with the means to support themselves and their families and by creating community support networks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647678"> For Canadians, there are benefits in safer communities through less recidivism as well as by adding to the workforce availability and through the socio-economic benefits such as offenders' custody—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647680">Madam Speaker, we are back this evening to try to get to the truth behind why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who once held NSICOP, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, in such high esteem, has suddenly changed his tune. The Prime Minister had once said he thought NSICOP was well-suited to examine foreign interference in Canada's democracy and our democratic institutions, but that does not seem to be the case anymore. What was the reason for the change in the Prime Minister's glowing support for NSICOP? What brought about this change? Could it have been a release of an NSICOP report that shed some light on the willingness of some members of the Liberal Party to accept political and financial benefits from foreign sources, most notably from agents of the Chinese government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647681">I had asked the<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> if he still felt that “Canadians need to have faith in their institutions and deserve answers and transparency”, his words; or, had his party's Beijing masters intervened and indicated a need for a reversal in that faith? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647682">In the reply to my question the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> had the audacity to suggest I was making things up. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is not me saying these things. The minister notes that NSICOP, the Hogue commission and even national media have done some deep digging to get to the bottom of foreign interference. The truth is that the Liberal government does not want what has been uncovered to come to light and, perhaps most important, it does not want Canadians to know about it. After all, if everything is going so well in the government's eyes, why is it that the Canadian people are still in the dark about the so-called “11”? Why are these people not arrested and why are they not before a court?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647683">There are laws in the Criminal Code that address treasonous acts. Subsection 46(2), paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) to be precise, sets out what constitutes the act of treason and it is quite clear. Subsection 46(2) states:</ParaText>

We wanted to address a question that many Canadians have been asking: Who are the parliamentarians who have been identified in that confidential NSICOP report? How can Canada have an election if Canadians do not know whether the people they are voting for have their best interests at heart? Some observers may also wonder if the current government is serving another master.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8647693"> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to the vital, ongoing work that the Government of Canada is doing to protect Canada's democratic institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647694">As all members of the House are aware, threats to Canada's democracy do not affect only some Canadians; they affect all Canadians. This is why the enhancements to safeguard Canada's democratic systems and processes against foreign interference set out in Bill <Document DbId="13064389" Type="3">C-70</Document> are supported across party lines. Indeed, the Government of Canada's ongoing work to protect Canada's electoral systems and democratic institutions includes efforts to maximize public transparency while protecting what and how government documents are shared. This is because the nature of some records, as well as how they are intended to be used, is fundamental to the functioning of our democratic system of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647695">I would like to take this opportunity to make clear what cabinet confidences are and why they are treated so carefully by the government. In this way, any misunderstanding along these lines can be put to an end. Cabinet confidences are documents prepared for members of cabinet. They include memoranda to cabinet, discussion papers, records of cabinet deliberations or decisions, records of communications between ministers, records to brief ministers and draft legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647696"> The Canadian government is a Westminster system of government and has been since Confederation. This means that the principle of keeping cabinet confidences secret is older than Canada itself. It originates from the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament, which dates back many centuries. Cabinet confidences are central to how the Westminster system functions because of another foundational principle called “cabinet collective responsibility”. The two principles complement each other. Members of cabinet consider all material at their disposal; they deliberate freely, and even disagree, around the cabinet table. Once the deliberations are finished, cabinet makes a collective decision, and all members are responsible for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647697">Therefore, the secrecy of these deliberations and of the materials that are used to make cabinet decisions is paramount to the system functioning as designed. This has long been understood by successive Canadian governments, which have upheld the principle of cabinet confidences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647698">In addition to the government, the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that cabinet confidentiality is essential to good government. Protecting Canada's democracy also means protecting our democratic institutions and ensuring that they can function as intended. Protecting cabinet confidences is not a nefarious act; rather, it is a fulfillment of the government's duty to uphold the long-established principles of Canada's system of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647699">While fulfilling this duty, the Government of Canada continues to support the ongoing work of the public inquiry into foreign interference, which it has done since the inquiry was established last year. The set of cabinet confidences specified in the terms of reference for the commission were already provided during the commission's first phase of work, and those terms were developed and agreed to by all recognized parties in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8647700">As it has done all along, the government will continue to provide thousands of classified documents to the commission and to make government witnesses available to answer the commission's questions. The Government of Canada looks forward to the commission's final report in December, and it will consider how its recommendations can further help to enhance Canada's measures against foreign interference in its electoral systems and its democratic institutions. </ParaText>
