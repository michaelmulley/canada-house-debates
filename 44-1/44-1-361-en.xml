              <ParaText id="8650832">Mr. Speaker, I move that the eighth report of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, presented on Tuesday, December 12, 2023, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650833">It will be interesting to talk today about the concurrence motion coming out of the heritage committee. I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650834">I have been on the heritage committee for years now, but last month I asked my constituents of Saskatoon—Grasswood for their views on the public broadcaster, the CBC. It was in response to the CBC paying out bonuses that added up to over $18 million, which were approved by the <Affiliation DbId="300004" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> and the Privy Council. Of that sum, $3.3 million went directly to CBC executives. Forty-five executives had their hands in the pocket of that $3.3 million, and it averaged out to $73,000 each for one year in bonuses. I could not believe the number. I see that even some Liberals are shaking their heads. They cannot believe that number either just for the executives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650835">I asked in a mail-out what we should do going forward with the CBC. Should we do nothing or keep it as is? Should we keep the CBC but make some changes, or simply defund it? Defunding the CBC has been the narrative of this party for months, if not a year and a half now, and for very good reason. I had literally hundreds of responses. It was probably the best response I have had in the nine years I have been a member of Parliament. Some 86.5% were in support of overhauling or even defunding the entire operation of the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650836">CBC CEO Catherine Tait admitted recently, about two weeks ago, that Canadians want to defund the CBC entirely. She was caught off guard that Canadians were talking about defunding her operation. She said that maybe she should have responded sooner to the public's outcry on how the corporation is compensated by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650837">In its corporate plan summary, tabled in the House of Commons, the CBC said viewers are leaving television, especially young people. They are going to streaming devices and have been doing so for many years. That is certainly not a surprise. However, a big surprise to me was the ad revenue. It has dropped another 9.6% in the last 12 months, which is a concern. I think trust in the CBC News organization, as we have seen across this country, has also dropped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650838">Here we have trust, viewership and revenue dropping, but what did not drop? The bonuses did not drop, surprise, surprise. In the last year, $18 million was handed out, and when Ms. Tait came before the heritage committee for the third time, she talked about the key performance indicators, better known as KPIs. She said that those determine the bonus structure. Amazingly, despite viewership, revenue and trust dropping, the bonuses remained. Why? Well, the CBC honchos, in their wisdom, decided to lower the key standards from a year ago so they could justify the rich bonuses. Only CBC executives would huddle up and determine that despite everything going down, they needed to protect their bonuses. They agreed to this and the Liberals bought in, agreeing to $18 million for the top-up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8650839">Since 2018, CBC viewership has collapsed nearly 50% and the CBC has failed to meet 79% of its key performance targets. Did I mention that the executives who got these bonuses were the same ones responsible a little over a year ago for cutting 800 jobs? These cuts amounted to about 10% of the entire workforce of CBC/Radio-Canada. The federal government, as we know, compensates the CBC. It gives the CBC about $1.3 billion a year, so the public broadcaster, to me, already has a head start over the private broadcasters in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650840">It does not stop there. It is even worse, believe it or not. The CBC was given millions in last year's fall economic statement. It was 21 million gift dollars last year, and another $21 million this year. On top of that, it generates about $400 million in ads, even though, as I just talked about, ad revenue is going down. Canadians need to understand that their government is choosing to give more than $1.3 billion to a company that already makes $400 million in advertising. Canadians are tired of their money being spent on bonuses for absolutely dismal performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650841">I questioned CBC/Radio-Canada's CEO at the Canadian heritage committee. Hundreds wrote in to us and others and took to social media to express their dismay about the arrogance and entitlement at a time when so many are hurting in this country. It is astonishing. One person said, “These elites live in their own bubble, protected from us by their entitlements and their social status. They simply do not care what we think, and are shocked that we would speak up against them. It is time to clean out the corrupt federal bureaucracy the Liberals have built.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650842">Broadcasters need to have accountability and fairness for people to have trust in them. How can Canadians possibly have any faith in an institution that rewards its executives after cutting hundreds of jobs in the last year? Canadians are tired of seeing their taxpayer funds mismanaged by the <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet. It is no wonder nobody trusts the government anymore with their money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650843">The Liberals fail to see that Canadians are struggling in every aspect of their lives. Their response is that they will give $18 million to the CBC, to their corporate buddies, at a time when a record number of Canadians are heading to food banks. In my city of Saskatoon, there was an outcry yesterday by the Saskatoon Food Bank, which is asking the public for help, as it is running out of the most essential items it gives out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650844">The Saskatoon Food Bank has seen a 40% increase since 2019, in five short years, yet the CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada believes it is appropriate to ask for millions of dollars in bonuses for executives after letting hundreds go. It is arrogance and is absolute tone-deafness. The CBC was failing to deliver all along on its key performance indicators, so it just changed the indicators. It lowered them from the year before and thought nobody would notice. Well, we noticed, and obviously Canadians have noticed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650845">The government has no remorse about giving out massive amounts of money, simply handing it out no questions asked. It is handing money over to the public broadcaster rather than supporting small and medium-sized newspapers. That was the issue with Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>, some may recall. It was a bill designed to help the newspaper industry, but telcos and the CBC, the public broadcaster, took it over. They thought they were going to get millions of dollars. It ended up that Google said it would give them under $100 million and they could disburse it, but there we go again. It was the CBC with its hands out; it was right there. The Liberal government is absolutely out of touch and the CBC is out of touch</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650846">That leads me to its CEO, Catherine Tait, who was appointed by the government in 2018. Since taking over, viewership, as I mentioned, has been cut in half. What worries me now is that Catherine Tait has not had a bonus in 2022-23—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8650852">Madam Speaker, I think that the Conservatives are running out of speakers on the question of privilege. About 100-plus Conservatives have stood up on the privilege issue. Because they are possibly running a little shy in terms of something new to say, which we have not heard for weeks, they now stand up and introduce a concurrence motion as opposed to having to debate the privilege motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650853">Is the Conservative Party so desperate to find speakers to deal with the privilege issue that it now has to bring in concurrence motions in order to filibuster its filibuster, which has an amendment to an amendment to a motion, a motion they actually support but refuse to allow to come to a vote? How silly is this?</ParaText>

It has done very good work in this country, especially in the province of Quebec, yet when it started cutting the 800 employees with CBC, the first place it looked was the province of Quebec and CBC/Radio-Canada. The most successful of the operations of CBC is CBC/Radio-Canada.</ParaText>

I agree with reining in the management, the fees and the bonuses; that should have been done a long time ago under several governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650862">However, when we look at Marketplace and Go Public, we see that there are issues with Rogers; Air Canada; Porter, most recently with persons with disabilities; McDonald's and E. coli; landlord tactics using artificial intelligence against consumers; sex trafficking by CEOs from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Nygard. There are issues with Honda with regard to the fuel pumps; Elon Musk over Tesla and its issues; Boeing, for example, on public safety; allowing the X platform, formerly Twitter, to use artificial intelligence against people; tobacco giants; emission scandals and car companies.

How arrogant that was.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8650865">Madam Speaker, as always, it is an honour to be able to stand in my place to represent the good people of Battle River—Crowfoot and, in particular, to talk about something that is gaining momentum: the conversation surrounding the mismanagement, the abuse of tax dollars and the unbelievable revelations that $18 million in bonuses were paid out to managers and executives at CBC even when that organization decided it would cut frontline workers right before Christmas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650866">The eighth report of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage addressed this very thing and reported back to the House. I will read the motion that we are debating here today. I believe the <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> on the other side somewhat acknowledged that Conservatives are far better at getting stuff accomplished than the government is. I think that was what he was admitting in his previous question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650867">The motion is, “That, given the job cuts announced at CBC/Radio-Canada for the year 2024, it would be inappropriate for the CBC to grant bonuses to executive members.” It is a very simple and straightforward motion, and it cuts to the heart of where there is mismanagement at CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650868">When it comes to the issue at hand, there are well-placed Liberal appointees getting rich from tax dollars. An egregious example is that job cuts were announced just before Christmas. The current president of CBC begged for more money, saying there would be more job cuts if CBC could not get more cash from the government. Unbelievably, CBC, at that same time, was going through the process of approving $18 million in bonuses. We do not have the specifics because the president and CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada refuses to disclose what her bonus package was proposed to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650869">At committee the other week, the president and CEO also refused to tell Canadians what her severance package would be. Further, she refused to rule out accepting a severance package as her term comes to an end. CBC begged for more money and handed out big bonuses, yet had the audacity to lay off frontline workers. It is because of that sort of arrogance and that sort of attitude by the CEO of CBC, Catherine Tait, that the defund argument has gained momentum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650870">Maybe Ms. Tait did not understand the ATIP process. For the many Canadians who I am sure are watching this very important debate, I will explain that any Canadian can ask for information from government through what is called an access to information request. There is a simple form online, and I believe it costs five bucks, a simple administrative fee. Someone can ask for information, which is virtually unlimited as long as it does not have to do with issues of privacy or national security, and there are a few other areas that are exempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650871">In this case, a reporter asked for information about the communications that the CEO of CBC would have had around defunding. The emails revealed that the CEO admitted there was momentum growing to defund CBC television.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650872">Certainly, when Ms. Tait was confronted with her own words at committee this past week, it was quite interesting to hear her response. Instead of acknowledging what she had said in a private email, she continued to defend her failed record and that of the Liberal government to the tune of $1.3 billion in subsidies each and every year and millions of dollars in bonuses. CBC has falling ad revenue, thus requiring more taxpayer subsidy. At the same time, there are fewer Canadians watching CBC television.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650873">There was a number thrown around at the heritage committee; the CBC talks about 20 million people interacting with its services. Many members of this place have a Facebook page, different social media presences or a website. Of course we all have the content that ends up online through ParlVU and other channels. It does not take that big a social media following to have millions of views over the course of a month. CBC, which includes some of the most expensive broadcasting infrastructure in the history of the country, brags that it has 20 million touch points for Canadians. There are those in this place, by comparison, who probably have a similar reach for some of their content, and it is done in a far less expensive way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8650874">Earlier, my colleague made mention about the key performance indicators, the KPIs. When most folks hear an acronym like KPI, it does not necessarily resonate with them. However, what we found very interesting is that in the last full fiscal year, 2022-23, prior to the one we just completed, CBC fulfilled three out of 14 key performance indicators that were the metrics that CBC itself said would determine whether it was successful in fulfilling its mandate. It is a bit like a student's grading their own paper. Even CBC admitted that it was failing at fulfilling its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650875">I would suggest that what is common sense when someone is failing is that they would make changes. CBC did make a change; I will admit that, but the change was not to improve what it was doing but to change the way it evaluates how it is doing. Therefore the circumstance is that the student was grading their own paper and acknowledged they failed the first go-around, but instead of making changes to ensure that they stopped failing in the future, they simply changed the metric by which they evaluated their poor performance in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650876">The result comes back to this: cash in the pockets of CBC executives, of which there are 43. When I learned that there were 43 executives at the public broadcaster, I thought that must be a typo. Give me a break. The average of the bonuses was $71,000 for each executive, to the tune of more than $3 million. This is at a time when Canadians are hurting, food bank usage has reached historic levels, home prices have doubled and the cost of everything is becoming unaffordable for regular Canadians. The average Canadian makes less than what a CBC executive would have received in a bonus. How out of touch is that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650877">To add insult to injury, the president and CEO, the executives and the managers who received bonuses at the CBC went to the frontline staff, before Christmas no less, and told them that their efforts there were not appreciated, that the executives would be keeping their job and their bonus but that the staff would lose theirs. They told them to go home and tell their family that. The arrogance is astounding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650878">The mismanagement is such a reflection of what we see on the benches of the Liberal cabinet, where members take for themselves but literally put out on the street hard-working men and women, the people who actually do the work while those who claim to make the decisions get rich.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650879">After nine years, there has been failing performance virtually across the spectrum at CBC, as well as lower ad revenue and a lower number of viewers. In fact, with the number of viewers the CBC gets, it is going to have to start changing the key performance indicator for that if it is even able to report it. We see increasingly that Canadians are simply not wanting to watch the content that CBC is producing. That is the simple fact of the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650880">Therefore when it comes down to it, it is time for common sense. It is time to defund the CBC and ensure that bonuses are not paid out to rich executives at the same time as they are cutting frontline workers. We get very political in this place as we are politicians in Parliament, but let me conclude by saying that I hope we can find unity in this place with respect to cancelling bonuses for executives when frontline workers are having their jobs cut.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8650901"> Madam Speaker, I put it in the form of a question earlier, but this is something that people really need to take a note of: the silliness of the Conservative Party today under the leadership of, I would suggest, a Conservative Reformer who is heavily influenced by the far right. The degree to which the Conservatives want to filibuster is incredible. Let us think about what they are proposing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650902"> First and foremost, the Conservatives moved a motion weeks ago on a question of privilege, saying that they want an issue to go to the procedure and House affairs committee. Now, after they moved that motion, we quickly found out that all members of the House were actually in favour of it. However, the Conservatives then flip-flopped a little and said no, they wanted to have some members speak to the motion. They then brought in an amendment and put up dozens of speakers. Next, they brought in a subamendment and put up dozens more speakers. This was not done to deal with the issue, but it was all in an attempt to frustrate the House of Commons. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is more concerned about the Conservative Party than about Canadians and the issues that we are facing, denying a litany of important pieces of legislation and other types of debate dealing with everything from online harms affecting children to courts converting from military to civilian courts, citizenship and so much more. The Conservatives are more interested in themselves and in forgoing what is in the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650903">Today, the Conservatives brought in a motion for concurrence in order to be able to filibuster their original filibuster of having an issue go to the procedure and House affairs committee. I find the degree to which the Conservatives are focused on themselves really interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650904"> There are lots of reports out there, 100-plus reports, that the Conservatives could call on. Which issue do they decide to pull out to contribute to their filibuster? It is the issue of the CBC. There is nothing new there, in the sense that the Conservative Party, especially under the current leadership, has no time at all for the CBC or CTV. The party's <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has no respect for either of those two media outlets. I suspect it is because the Conservatives do not like it when their behaviour and their actions are reflected in the national news. They would rather rely on misinformation, fake news, social media and the data bank they have of a million-plus emails. They want to take a page out of U.S. politics and spread massive amounts of misinformation. That is how they believe they are going to be successful. The more uninformed Canadians are, the greater the likelihood of the Conservatives' being successful becomes. The more they can promote hatred towards politicians, the more they will be successful. That is the reason the Conservatives want to talk about the CBC today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650905">It is interesting. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> actually raised an issue that I want to spend a bit of time talking about. I believe there is a personal vendetta that we are seeing with the Conservative Party. The Conservatives have a hatred for CBC, which is well known and well established. If we look at some of the things that it has been reporting on, that is where we will find why the Conservatives want to talk about the CBC today. The Conservatives have their sights on getting rid of CBC because CBC is informing Canadians about what is happening in a very real sense.</ParaText>

I have consistently asked these questions because the answers the Conservatives are giving are completely unrelated to the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650907">Interestingly enough, the CBC had a report on it, and I want to share some things the CBC is actually saying. I would ask members to make the connection as to whether there is any surprise the Conservative Party of Canada, headed by its extreme-right <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, has no time for the CBC and wants to get rid of it. This is the reason we are seeing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650908"> Here is a report that came out on CBC that members can check. The headline was “Why won't [the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">PM</Affiliation>] release classified names — and why won't [the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>] get a security clearance?” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8650909"> I am going to read some of the details in it, but the issue is very serious. In fact, interestingly, I actually have two reports from the CBC.

              <ParaText id="8651005">Madam Speaker, there has been a suggestion that I might want to amend the motion, but maybe this would be a good discussion point once it gets to committee. I like to think that progressive parties, whether it is the Greens, the NDP or the Bloc, understand and appreciate the true value of the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651006"> It is somewhat ironic that we have the Conservative Party saying, on one hand, that it is going to get rid of the CBC if it is elected in government while, on the other hand, it is advertising on the CBC. The reason why it is advertising on the CBC is that the Conservative Party knows that a lot of people follow and have a lot of respect for the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651007"> There seems to be a bit of a contradiction there, but the reality is that the Conservative Party has been highly critical of not only the CBC but also CTV.

              <ParaText id="8651008">Madam Speaker, I have to admit, I would have liked to keep listening to the answers of the member for Winnipeg North, because he is one of the public broadcaster's defenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651009">I also support a healthy, neutral, and reliable public broadcaster, but one that can take criticism, because I think that the broadcaster we have right now has shown us that it deserves a healthy dose of criticism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651010">Before getting to the heart of the matter, I would like to digress for a moment and remind everyone that we have reached that time of year when we honour those who served in the armed forces down through the years and decades and who fought in global conflicts in which Canada took part. Many of the people whose memory we honour lost their lives. Most parliamentarians and employees on Parliament Hill wear the poppy, and I think that is wonderful. I also think it is important to take a moment every year to remember those who, in some cases, laid down their lives for the freedom that we enjoy today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651011">I would like to raise a small matter that is nonetheless important from a protocol standpoint. I would like to remind my colleagues that the poppy should be worn above all other distinctions, decorations or pins. This message may prompt my colleagues to rearrange their clothing a bit in the lobby before they enter the House later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651012">I mentioned earlier that our public broadcaster, CBC/Radio-Canada, is not exempt from criticism, and certainly not under Catherine Tait, whose term is drawing to a close. I cannot say that I was a great fan of many of her decisions. I also cannot say that I applauded all of her decisions or actions during her term, which, in my opinion, was unduly extended by the then minister of Canadian heritage. I think she missed a few good opportunities. She had the opportunity to make certain decisions, but she missed the boat, as we say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651013">For example, her decision to have an English podcast translated in Paris rather than hiring Quebec dubbers, who are among the best in the world, was extremely questionable. In fact, you could say flat out that the dubbing industry in Quebec is the best in the world. Tait's decision showed a lack of familiarity with the francophone market, which she should have represented with the same effectiveness and knowledge as she did the anglophone market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651014">In my opinion, some of her decisions were based more on irrational ideology than on what we could call common sense, although the term “common sense” is debatable these days. Thus, the scandal surrounding the use of the N-word by columnist Simon Jodoin to refer to a book title reached extremely uncomfortable proportions. We could also consider the resignation of Michel Bissonnette, a prominent figure in Quebec television with unimpeachable credibility. The fact that he decided to leave Radio-Canada because it no longer aligned with his convictions was a sign that something was wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651015">Then we have the decision to announce major cuts just a few weeks from Christmas. Last year, on December 4, 2023, Tait announced that 250 jobs were to be cut at Radio-Canada and another 250 at CBC, and that 200 already vacant positions would be abolished. In all, 700 to 800 jobs would officially disappear. The decision to make equal cuts in French-language Radio-Canada services and English-language CBC services was never implemented, for a number of reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651016">First, we absolutely have to protect the public broadcaster's French-language services. We absolutely have to protect Radio-Canada, which is doing well, is surpassing its targets, is profitable, if we can use that term, and makes quality productions that appeal to television audiences. It also offers content that appeals to users on different platforms, whether on television, radio or online.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651017">Also, Radio-Canada must make do with fewer resources than its anglophone counterpart, CBC, so when it was announced that the 500 job cuts would be distributed equally between Radio-Canada and CBC, my goodness, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. This is just unbelievable, not to mention that this hamfisted announcement came right before Christmas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651018">It had the following effect. In the months that followed, staff unsure about whether their job would be cut had to work with this sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. This strikes me as extremely poor judgment on the part of someone holding such an important position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651019">Having said that, despite being critical of Ms. Tait, I will distance myself from the Conservatives in that we cannot make the facts say what we want them to say strictly in service of an ideology, a conviction, an idea or a populist plan like the one to slash CBC funding. As we know, the<Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and Conservative Party leader wants to cut the CBC's funding. I always figured that it was because the Conservative Party leader was allergic to quality journalism. In fact, a good journalist will call him out when he talks rubbish. A serious journalist takes in the information communicated to them, analyzes it and makes sure that the public is not fed falsehoods, misinformation or even disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651020">I do not think that all is perfect with CBC/Radio‑Canada's news coverage. However, I do believe that the organization adheres to the news sector's most exigent and stringent standards in Canada, North America and elsewhere in the world. I know that CBC/Radio‑Canada models itself after other public broadcasters. In fact, they all draw inspiration from and are associated with one another, to some extent. I know that we here draw inspiration from what is done elsewhere, and those elsewhere draw inspiration from what is being done here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651021">We can be critical. We do not always have to agree. Indeed, there are complaint mechanisms in place. If the leader of the Conservatives wants to complain about how a news item was covered, he has the right to do so. He can do that. Anyone can do that; every citizen has that right. There is a mechanism in place. Sometimes corrections are made if a piece of information was poorly communicated or if false or biased information was communicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651022">However, the Conservatives have a tendency to want to manipulate the facts, to play with the truth and to be a little creative so that the information the general public receives is easier to digest and, in some cases, more objectionable. For example, they might try to get people to believe that the government is incompetent or that the House cannot do its job while the Liberals are in power. A rigorous public broadcaster does not fit into that scenario. I think that is probably the main reason why the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut CBC funding. CBC journalists spend their time explaining to the public that what the Leader of the Opposition says makes no sense. That is not bad journalism, it is rigorous journalism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651023">Now, should CBC/Radio-Canada continue on as is? I do not think so. On the contrary, I think that a lot of things need to be looked at. I will not get into details, because I am not familiar with the details. The minister is about to move a motion for a new mandate for the public broadcaster, and we are waiting with impatience, since it will establish what kind of public broadcaster we will have in the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651024">A lot of things need to be looked at, and first to allow CBC/Radio-Canada to face the challenges the entire industry is currently facing. I am thinking about the arrival of the digital giants and the opening up of digital media in general, the access we have to information in general through the digital media.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651025">Yes, regulation is important, but the fact remains that news is abundantly available and that people these days generally seek out a variety of news sources. These are the challenges that must be faced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651026">We are also faced with a fragmented advertising market. So many players are being added and advertisers have so many options that some consideration must be given to how a public broadcaster will be funded. Is it a good idea to have advertising on CBC/Radio‑Canada? I think we must give this some very serious consideration. I think that if we also want to grant total independence to a public broadcaster and we want it to be rigorous and neutral in delivering the news, we can certainly revisit the idea of having it air advertising in all circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651027">That said, doing away with advertising as a means of funding CBC/Radio‑Canada opens the door to another form of funding, namely public funding. Are Quebeckers and Canadians open to the idea of increasing public funding for CBC/Radio‑Canada so that advertising can be eliminated? These are the questions we have to ponder, and this is not the kind of thought process we can undertake when people are being bombarded with idiotic slogans about defunding the CBC because it is the government's propaganda arm or whatever. Can we not just behave as adults and deal with the actual challenges facing us? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651028">The first question to ask is whether we want a public broadcaster and whether we want CBC/Radio‑Canada. If nobody wants it, we can scrap it, toss it in the trash and switch to something else. However, when Canadians were asked whether they wanted a public broadcaster and liked their public broadcaster, 83% answered yes. That is a lot of people, 83%, saying they do not want to lose CBC/Radio‑Canada. When Quebeckers are asked whether they want to keep Radio‑Canada's French-language service, the percentage is even higher, because Radio-Canada is part of Quebec's cultural and television landscape. It is an indispensable vehicle for the transmission of Quebec and francophone culture. An impressive number of top-notch Quebec productions have been broadcast on Radio-Canada or created by Radio-Canada itself, and some have been translated and exported to other countries. Radio-Canada is something we cannot do without.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651029">The question we need to ask is whether we even want a public broadcaster. The answer to that, if we ask the main stakeholders, Quebeckers and Canadians, is yes. Consequently, if we want to work according to people's wishes, if we want to be effective and to avoid disinformation and populism, we can do something. If the Conservatives really wanted to be productive and do good work, they would ask themselves the right questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651030">Okay, we do not want any more bonuses. Let us review CBC/Radio-Canada's compensation model so that everyone is comfortable with it. Let us see what is done elsewhere. Let us look at other countries, like Australia, that have public broadcasters. The CEO of ABC, which is the Australian equivalent of CBC/Radio-Canada, earns $1.2 million a year. Ms. Tait earns $500,000 or $600,000 with her bonuses. Is that comparable? Can we tell people who think she is earning too much at $500,000 that the CEO of Bell is earning $13 million? The private sector pays 5, 6, 7, 8 or 10 times what she earns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651031">At some point, can we talk responsibly, knowledgeably and reasonably and figure out what we want? Do we want a quality public broadcaster, knowing that it will cost <I>x</I> amount? Some people think that CBC/Radio-Canada costs a fortune, that it is terrible and that it is impoverishing Canadians. I cannot get over that one. To hear the Conservatives speak, people are about to start lining up at food banks because Radio-Canada costs too much. I sense that that is where we are going, yet I would like to remind members that it costs about $31 a year per Canadian for CBC/Radio-Canada and all it has to offer: television, radio, online content and international coverage that we would certainly not be able to afford if we had only private broadcasters. I said earlier that there appears to be a consensus that we should keep CBC/Radio-Canada. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651032">If we want a public broadcaster, we need to compare ourselves with other countries that have one. I said earlier that Canadians pay $31 per capita per year. Switzerland has a public broadcaster that costs $191 per capita per year. We can also look at Sweden. We love comparing ourselves with Sweden. We like comparing ourselves with the Scandinavian countries. It looks like everything is perfect over there. Sweden is a small country of 9 million people. It has a public broadcaster, and it costs $106 a year per capita. No one there complains that it costs too much or that the CEO is earning a fortune. If we want to compare ourselves with the most prestigious public broadcaster in the world, the BBC, it costs $96 Canadian a year per capita for the BBC's services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651033">We all pay $31 out of our pockets every year. I do not think that is outrageous for what we get in return. Does that mean we cannot question it? Absolutely not. Does that mean that everything is well done and well managed? Again, absolutely not. Does that mean we should not be looking at how these people are being paid? No, quite the opposite. However, we have to go about this responsibly and productively, as adults, not with slogans like “defund CBC/Radio-Canada” because Catherine Tait gave her executives $18 million in bonuses this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651034">Returning to the question of bonuses and compensation, there is nothing easier than to make a lot of noise. Telling a lie or using coarse language, that takes five seconds. Once that has been said and it is out there, it takes energy, resources and determination to take it apart and explain to people that this is rude and not at all true, and to lay out the facts. This is by no means self-evident. Along the way, we lose at least half the people, who will continue swallowing the lies and the crudeness. Taking the bonuses paid to executives and turning that into a mismanagement scandal involving CBC/Radio-Canada, well, that is quite a stretch. Let us break this down, or at least put it into perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651035">I will come back to the fact that paying $18 million in bonuses to executives and personnel while at the same time announcing that there will be job and budget cuts and that the government must advance a few million more dollars to end the fiscal year can indeed be seen as somewhat indecent and can breed a certain cynicism. I will admit that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651036">We have to tell it like it is. I said it right from the start: I am by no means Ms. Tait's biggest fan, but in her defence, she came to committee several times and explained how the system works, a system she did not put in place. This is how things work at CBC/Radio-Canada. She explained how the compensation model works. It struck me as questionable and it should perhaps be reviewed, but it certainly was not the scandal the Conservatives have described today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651037">Yes, the compensation model for senior executives, and even for the entire staff of CBC/Radio-Canada, needs to be reviewed. We say yes to this. Yes, we need to discuss how to put people at ease when an employee's salary is announced, so that people will say they are aware, that they know how things work, that they are comfortable with that, and that this is part of the overall picture. We say yes to this, but we say no to the type of disinformation only intended to vilify a public broadcaster that has the potential to deliver excellent quality and that remains, in my opinion, among the most credible news sources we could have here in Quebec and Canada. </ParaText>

CBC/Radio-Canada had 25% listenership in the province of Quebec, and yet CBC executives decided to hit CBC/Radio-Canada first, with 800 employees losing their jobs. Some $18 million was presented in bonuses, with $3.3 million going to executives.

The cuts announced in December did not happen that way. That being said, it is no less scandalous, because it means that 600 people throughout the CBC/Radio-Canada network lived for months under the sword of Damocles, not knowing whether their position would be eliminated and they would lose their job. In all, 346 jobs, not 800, were cut. One hundred and forty-one people were let go, and 205 positions were eliminated. That is still way too much. When you announce cuts like that at the same time as you award bonuses, you need to explain yourself to the public.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651064"> Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the following main motion, “That, given the job cuts announced at CBC/Radio-Canada for the year 2024, it would be inappropriate for the CBC to grant bonuses to executive members.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651065">The NDP supports the motion, but what I find fascinating is that it is coming from the Conservatives, the same Conservatives who have finally met an executive bonus they oppose. That is how ideologically committed they are, that their love of billionaires and millionaires trying to join them can be overcome to the point that they will oppose excessive executive bonuses, but only as long as those bonuses are going to CBC executives. If it were anyone else, they would be fine with it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651066">This is why it really is a misnomer when the Liberals say that the Conservatives hate the CBC. I am not sure they do. In fact, I would argue that the Conservatives love the CBC and love, in particular, that someone like Catherine Tait has so poorly run the CBC that they found the one group of executives they can rail against. They love that they comfortably attack these executives and hope that no one notices they cater to every other wealthy executive. As we have heard here today, it is the same Conservatives who are spending significant resources to advertise on the CBC as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651067">Would the Conservatives argue against bonuses for oil executives who are ravaging the planet? A report released by the Bedford Consulting Group looked at executive compensation at 68 oil and gas companies. While Canadians struggle to fill up their cars, executive bonuses increased over 20%. The average compensation for executives at companies with assets over $30 billion was over $16.6 million. Did the Conservatives speak up when it came to those executive bonuses? Of course not. They really love these ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651068">Galen Weston's bonuses increased by over 50% in a single year, while at the same time his board argued that he was underpaid. I am sure that my Liberal and Conservative friends agree. If they did not, they would have supported an NDP effort to tie executive pay to workers, but they did not. Once again, they love these bonuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651069">Speaking of telecommunications, Bell Media's Mirko Bibic received over $30 million in bonuses in a single year, while laying off thousands of workers, and yet the Conservatives and Liberals approved millions of dollars in taxpayer money, sent directly to Bell Media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651070"> It is clear why the Conservatives are so beholden to corporate interests, especially when the Conservative Party has at least five billionaire donors, two in real estate, which is also probably why the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> refuses to take on corporate landlords, making buying a house unattainable for young Canadians. Two donors are in finance, which is why the Conservative leader joined the Liberals in voting against closing tax loopholes that allow billionaires to hide their money in offshore tax havens. One billionaire donor sells food and other basic needs, which is probably why the Conservatives joined the Liberals to block an excess profits tax for grocery stores. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651071">However, the Conservatives still complain when the NDP forces the Liberals to deliver for Canadians, fighting for billions in housing for first nations, for pharmacare and dental care, so Canadians do not have to make impossible choices; to increase the fight for increased union power by banning scab labour. It is because the idea of standing up for anything is so anathema to the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651072">While the Conservatives like to go on and on about a coalition of the Liberals and the NDP, they hide the real coalition in the country, one of corporate greed enabled by two political parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, who prefer to do nothing while Canadians struggle. The reality is that 56 of the richest Canadians donate to the Liberal Party while 61 have donated to the Conservative Party. The wealthiest people in our country do not see a difference between Liberals and Conservatives. Therefore, excuse me if I ask to be spared the Conservative crocodile tears about CBC bonuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651073">CBC bonuses are wrong, and the NDP is clear that they are wrong. A public broadcaster, a Crown corporation, should not be doling out executive bonuses, especially at a time when it is making cuts and it is failing to fulfill its regional broadcasting mandates. However, I would argue that the Conservatives do not actually care about executive bonuses. What they really care about is hurting the CBC.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651074"> That is why the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservatives</Affiliation> will appear on True North, a conspiracy theory website that platforms banned far-right hate groups like the Proud Boys, to proclaim that he cannot wait to defund the CBC. This plays right into Liberal hands. The Liberals can demonize the Conservative leader for wanting to destroy the CBC, and ignore their own record of doing exactly that. It was after their threat of a 3% cut across the board that Catherine Tait and her board decided to lay off 800 workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651075">It is under the current government that the CBC's workforce has shrunk to the point that it is smaller than it was under the Stephen Harper government, those dark days when it came to cuts to the CBC. We are once again seeing the Liberal special, and that is to criticize the Conservatives for doing what the Liberals do by stealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651076"> The end result is that Canadians are losing out. While the CBC is cutting jobs across the country, it is really Canadians who are paying the price. It is Canadians, especially in northern, rural, indigenous communities, living in media deserts who do not have their stories told.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651077">When the CBC relies on offices in Winnipeg and elsewhere to tell the stories of people like here in northern Manitoba and in other northern and rural regions of the country, it is all Canadians who lose out. We lose out on our stories, our voices and our reality that matters to all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651078"> As media becomes more concentrated, we hear less about how the 20 richest Canadians have $214 billion in wealth, equivalent to over 10% of Canada's GDP. That is 20 people, 10% of the country, in terms of GDP. This reality is unsustainable, and we need to do something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651079">We hear less about how 123 corporations get out of paying $30 billion in taxes in a single year, relying on loopholes that the NDP has called on the government to close. However, the Liberals and Conservatives, once again, do everything they can to keep those loopholes open.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651080">I want to go back to the Liberal subamendment to this debate. The Liberals are, once again, coming across that they want to do something when it comes to saving the CBC, but the reality is that we know that the threats made by the Liberals to cut the CBC contributed to an environment where the CBC went ahead and cut 800 positions not too long ago. The Liberals talk a good talk when it comes to the CBC, but the reality is that they are doing little to strengthen a public broadcaster and pursue the kind of accountability Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651081">A couple of months ago, when the story first broke that executive bonuses had been doled out at the CBC, we released the following statement, “It is...time to ban the CBC from paying bonuses.” The Liberals have failed to act. When CBC president Catherine Tait came to committee, I made it clear the CBC was acting more and more like a private broadcaster, including on bonuses. Canadians deserve better. I also called on President Tait to commit to cancelling executive bonuses to save CBC jobs. Now we hear that not only did they take the bonuses, but they add up to more than $18 million. This is while Canadians lost their jobs at the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651082"> Unlike the Conservatives who want to cut the CBC, we want accountability and we want to improve it. The Liberals have overseen a CBC that has not fulfilled its regional mandate the way it ought to fulfill it. Earlier, we heard about cuts to Radio-Canada, which is an essential service for francophone communities, for Quebec, for regions in our country like New Brunswick, where Radio-Canada is the go-to broadcaster for francophones. We also know that CBC has cut and failed to fulfill its mandate in regions like mine, here in northern Manitoba, where, for years, we have not had a permanent presence to fill the local broadcasting station, known as CBC North Country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651083">In fact, very cynically, the president of the CBC, President Tait, when she came to our committee in May of this year, declared that the position here had been filled. We went on to find out that it was by a journalist who came in for two months as a secondment from another CBC office elsewhere in Canada. To me and to our region, that was a cynical message from the CBC, that it was willing to get away with PR messaging that it had filled this critical position, a position that it is mandated to fill. However, the person who filled it was only here for two months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651084"> I want to recognize that over these past years, the fact that we have not had a CBC presence has meant that the CBC coverage of our region has not been up to par. One-off stories about our communities do not cut it when it comes to relaying the real issues, challenges, opportunities, good news and bad news stories that need to be told on behalf of our region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651085">We also know that the CBC has not built the relationships on the ground to convey the stories that people have to share, stories that undoubtedly inform the view of Canadians of what is happening in northern Canada, what is happening in indigenous communities and what is happening in resource-based communities, many of which are facing immense challenges but are also pursuing exciting opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651086"> Our voices and these stories are not being told as a result of the CBC failing to fill the position in our station, which at one time had three people working in it. As a result of cuts, it was reduced to one. Now, as I mentioned, it has been years since that position has been fulfilled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651087">I will note that our region has a proud history when it comes to the CBC. I believe it is the first region that had full-time programming in Cree, again based in northern Manitoba. It was also the region that gave Peter Mansbridge his start. He was discovered in Churchill, interestingly enough not broadcasting but working at the airport. It is said that a CBC producer heard his voice and thought he would be great for radio. He of course went on to have an illustrious career broadcasting for the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651088"> Our region has a rich history when it comes to broadcasting and the CBC. However, instead of respecting that and instead of living up to its obligations under the CRTC and its mandate for regional programming, the CBC has failed to fill this position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651089"> I want to raise the issue of leadership. Some years ago, when it was announced that our station would be shut down under the Harper government, we worked closely with then-president Hubert Lacroix. He listened to our communities, he worked with our communities and we were able to restore service in northern Manitoba. This was much appreciated. People in northern Manitoba felt heard by the CBC at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651090"> I contrast that to Ms. Tait's leadership, where we have not seen support for this station and just a short-term fill, which is not a solution to the broadcasting needs of our region and CBC's mandate. In fact, when I raised this issue in committee last week, the answers I received were entirely inadequate and, frankly, irrelevant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651091"> Ms. Tait went on to talk about other regions in the country. This was not about that. Regions like ours, northern Canada and indigenous communities, deserve local and regional broadcasting in their regions telling their stories. That is why it is critical that we talk about strengthening the CBC and ensuring that we are investing in the regional and local journalism that is required. This is especially urgent at a time when private broadcasters are pulling out from regions across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651092">We saw record cuts made by Bell Media. We saw cuts and the loss of broadcasting when Rogers took over Shaw. We have seen cuts by media outlets across the country. What we have now are entire media deserts in parts of our country where journalists are not based to tell the stories within these regions. This makes Canada less well off in its connections and is absolutely a hindrance to building an informed citizenry. It is a hit to our democracy in many ways, as Canadians do not have access to and knowledge of the stories of people even within their own regions, provinces and other parts of the country. It is also a contributor to misinformation. People are turning elsewhere to get the news, and not necessarily to reputable sites and sources. Of course, we know the far right has taken advantage of this void and sought to push its agenda through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651093">While we support the banning of executive bonuses, we certainly do not support the Conservatives' full frontal attack on the CBC and Radio-Canada. We need a strong public broadcaster, but not one that doles out executive bonuses and cuts jobs, not one that does not fulfill local and regional broadcasting mandates, as we are seeing right now with the CBC, and not one failing to tell Canadian stories from across the country. We need a public broadcaster, a CBC, that is accountable to Canadians and has as its priority local and regional journalism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651094">We also need to cut through the Liberal games. The Liberals have threatened to cut the CBC, have overseen the doling out of $18 million in bonuses and have failed to ensure the CBC fulfills its local and regional broadcasting mandates. Canadians deserve a strong CBC, an accountable CBC, a CBC that puts Canadians at the centre, does not prioritize bonuses and does not leave glaring gaps when it comes to local and regional broadcasting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651095">With that in mind, I would like to make an amendment to the amendment. I propose that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “that” and substituting the following: The eighth report of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, presented on Tuesday, December 12, 2023, be not now concurred in, but that it be recommitted to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage for further consideration, provided that it be an instruction to the committee to study the consequences of defunding the CBC and Radio-Canada, including how the Liberals' threat to cut funding led to hundreds of CBC/Radio-Canada job cuts, including the effects on smaller communities, as promised by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651096">I hope my fellow colleagues will support the subamendment we are putting forward, and, more importantly, that as Canadian parliamentarians we get behind strengthening our public broadcaster, rendering it accountable by banning executive bonuses and investing in local and regional journalism. Canadians deserve it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651135">However, we are here on a concurrence report. What does that mean? It means that the opposition has chosen to use more time in this House to bring forward a committee report that was already duly passed at the committee stage and requires a government response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651136"> In this particular instance, I am actually pleased to have the opportunity to explain and to give some context to my Conservative colleagues about the concern I have about the direction they may want to take on public broadcasting. However, I would be remiss if I did not use at least a minute or two to explain to Canadians the concern I have about the fact that the procedural elements of this House, the ability for this House to get work done, has been completely gummed up by the Conservatives, closing on three weeks now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651137">There is, before this House, a question of privilege. Questions of privilege are undoubtedly important. They matter, and there have been two of them raised, according to the Speaker. Now, the Speaker has been very clear that, in relation to the question of privilege that is before this House right now, it should be referred to committee. However, what has happened is that there has not been an ability to actually have that vote called because, of course, our procedural rules allow, on questions of privilege, every single member in this House to be able to rise and speak to it. What have members of the Conservative Party done? They have continued to move amendments and subamendments to continue to restart that clock, and not on a genuine concern about the question of privilege, but to tie up the affairs and the resources of this House so that other business cannot actually happen. I think that is shameful, particularly because the House leader has been very clear that we would welcome a vote, an ability to actually litigate this matter, and be able to move it forward. At some point, I think Canadians are going to have to ask: When will the Conservative Party actually allow this House to get back to the legitimate business of government and the things that matter most crucially to Canadians? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651138">I am not saying that the question of privilege is not important, and I am not saying that the issues surrounding it do not matter, but there is clear consensus in this House to actually move forward. Instead, the Conservatives are using procedural tactics to delay the ability for the government to perhaps introduce a fall economic statement, and the ability to discuss other things that actually matter to Canadians. We are going on three weeks, and I hope that at some point during my question time here today when I am asked, one of my Conservative colleagues will tell me when we can actually get on with it. However, it does allow me to focus on my constituents and the needs at home, and I do welcome that. I welcome the opportunity to continue to be at home and focus on the needs for my constituents, and so I thank the Conservatives in the same breath as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651139">Today's aspect is a question around a report to the House that relates to executive compensation awarded to Catherine Tait, the CBC president. It is important to remind Canadians that the agency, our public broadcaster in this country, is, of course, accountable to Parliament because of the money provided on an annual basis, which is around a billion dollars, but it is independent of government. Of course, we would not know that when, at times, we hear the opposition stand up to suggest that it is a “propaganda arm” of the government, which is dangerous language, because it undermines public broadcasting in this country. Also, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has gone so far as to suggest that CTV is a “propaganda arm” for the Prime Minister. This is the kind of playbook that we are seeing by right-wing parties and leaders around the world to try to undermine the credibility of media institutions across the country and this idea that we cannot believe what journalists report. I will take a moment to give my perspective on this. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651140"> When I read the National Post, I inherently understand that it has more of a centre-right bent. I do not stand here in this place and say what I read in the National Post is untrue, or that it is out to just attack the government, or it is an attack dog for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. I do not say that, because I am not trying to undermine journalism integrity in this country. When I read The Globe and Mail, I would say that is right down the middle. Others may see it as right-wing or left-wing, but I do not believe what The Globe and Mail is saying in this country is factually untrue, even if it may have a journalistic bias; the same with our public broadcaster. Again, the Conservatives will voice concerns about the integrity of that institution. They call it into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651141"> The irony in all of this, though, is that if we actually watch the social media channels of the members of the official opposition we can see how they love to cherry-pick stories when there is an actual story that is critical of the government. Of course, it is the job of our public broadcaster to be critical and to provide information. In one breath, they will say it is the “propaganda arm” of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or some type of North Korean dynamic here in this country. They gaslight and fire up Canadians, but yet they will use the content from our public broadcaster when it suits their narrative. In my neck of the woods, we call that hypocrisy and it is disingenuous to the debates that we need to have in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651142"> I am going to get to the debate in this place where, of course, the text of this motion deals with the compensation that the CBC has provided to executives and other members of the team. Do I think that that was ill-suited in today's context? Absolutely, I do. When the CBC CEO announced job cuts to our public broadcaster, I think there needed to be more context. That was unconscionable. I think the member for <Affiliation DbId="278512" Type="2">Fleetwood—Port Kells</Affiliation> used that word. In an environment where an employer is laying off employees while choosing to compensate at the same time, usually that would be a moment when the employer would tell their executive leadership team that they are proud of their work, but right now they are in an environment where they maybe just cannot provide that because it would send the wrong message as they lay people off. It is just not the right course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651143"> I do agree with that motion of the text. I think it was unfortunate. Here is the thing, though, as this is the dynamic as well: a government ought to be and needs to be careful. I think it was the member for <Affiliation DbId="278477" Type="2">Saskatoon—Grasswood</Affiliation> who talked about the idea that the government should have intervened. If we truly want an independent broadcaster, a public broadcaster, the government ought to be careful about intervening in those cases. I heard Conservatives talking about the idea that the public broadcaster is too tied to the agenda of the government, yet they want the government to intervene directly. Rather, we actually want our independent broadcaster to be truly independent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651144"> I think there is also a legitimate question about talent and maintaining talent in these environments. There are people who have requisite skill sets. It is a competitive environment out there in the media landscape. I do think an important question to ask is about remuneration. That matters, as it will ensure we have quality journalists and quality management that will be able to ensure our public broadcaster stays competitive in the media landscape. I want to address that. However, this opportunity has arisen where it gives me more opportunity to speak to public broadcasting across the country and why it matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651145"> Mr. Speaker, you and I represent rural ridings in Nova Scotia. Maybe you do not go out to make an announcement as often as you would like, but the government has done some good things in West Nova. We want to get out to talk about that or about the initiatives we want to do as MPs, but it is not easy to find an actual media outlet in West Nova or Kings—Hants because the environment we are in right now is one where we have actually seen a shrinking of local media in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651146"> It is extremely challenging. Whether someone is a member of Parliament or a citizen, we are living in an environment where people are trying to find credible information about what is happening in the world. Often, we are getting our information from our cell phones. There is power in having a computer in your hand, an ability to find information all around the world, but we are also in a world of algorithms and social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651147">When I went to Hants East Rural High, there used to be papers laid out at the library. When we had a free block of time we would read the news about what was going on in the world. We had flip phones; we did not have the whole Internet to access at our fingertips. When I talk to young people, when I go into high schools in my riding, I ask them where they get their news. Many will answer that they get it from TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram; social media. That tells me how old I am feeling in this place. I am 33.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651148"> It has been a very interesting exercise as I talk to young people about who comes up a lot on their social media. It is Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. These are the types, even among young women. We can see the algorithm. Once one goes to see one or two things, one starts seeing it in echo chambers. Whether or not it is individuals who I think we could clearly classify as on the far right or even on the far left, it does a disservice to our society to be in a situation where we do not get a breadth of information to be able to help inform our opinion. We are in an echo chamber. We are seeing the same things. We might start to believe that everything we are seeing is absolutely true. I think it is important to have critical thought and that we have individuals and trusted journalism that can actually help us understand the context of what we are dealing with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651149"> I want to talk about the CBC in the context of the regions. Atlantic Canada is, I think, perhaps the best example of where the public broadcaster has an important presence and a long and storied tradition. I can think of programs like the CBC's <I>Land and Sea</I>. I do not know how often members have watched it, but I know many of my constituents do. It is an informative documentary series that talks about our communities. Global, CTV or other private broadcasters are not going to deliver that element of Canadian content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651150"> I think about <I>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</I>. Its editorial control is still in Halifax. I think about family friends, including Kendall Nowe, who do important work there. I have been in the studio. It is being driven by Canadian actors to provide a bit of comedic relief. I think we could use more of that here in Ottawa and a little more levity in this place. It is important because it is true Canadian content being developed in the regions. I think of <I>Son of a Critch</I>, and these Newfoundland types of shows. I think about the CBC's evening news in Prince Edward Island, which is by far the leading example of our public broadcaster having a large market share of that evening news where Islanders will tune in to watch the CBC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651151">However, the CBC is not above reproach; we cannot suggest there does not have to be reform. In fact, I am of the view that, although public broadcasting is absolutely crucial in this country, we need to maintain it. It scares the heck out of me that members of the opposition want to cut it in a world of algorithms and declining local media. They want to get rid of trusted journalism, and that is concerning, but let us not pretend they do not need a bit of a boot in the butt. I think that is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651152">There a couple things that I would note based on the conversations I have had over the last 10 years. Increasingly, the CBC and its editorial control is centralized in Toronto. I love my good friends from Toronto, I love the members of Parliament of all sides who reside there. It is a great city, but I am sorry, that is what our big, privately held media companies are doing. They are centralizing their editorial content out of the middle of the country. I can tell members that there is a vastly different perspective in regional Canada and in rural Canada, so we need to be able to make sure that there are resources not in our biggest city of the country that may not reflect what is happening in rural Canada, which is the entire emphasis of our public broadcaster, but in the areas of the country where the private broadcasters would not go because, frankly, there was not a business case to do it. Why is it that, under the CBC's leadership, it has increasingly put its resources in the middle of the country, which is already being served quite well by private broadcasters? We need the exact opposite. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651153">I will give one example that CBC executives were putting out to the regional headquarters in downtown cities across the country. They need to sell those locations and move a bit further out to the suburbs. We cannot afford those properties downtown. Guess what? They did not take the Kool-Aid in Toronto. It is right downtown. If we are going to say that in Halifax, we ought to be doing it in Toronto. Let us put CBC headquarters out in the suburban areas, if that is what we think is good for St. John's, Halifax, Charlottetown and other areas. I think if we are going to maintain the confidence of a public broadcaster in this country, we need to make sure that, first and foremost, it is serving the regions where there is no private broadcasting to actually meet their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651154"> I can tell members that when I go to make announcements in my own riding, maybe I get lucky with a SaltWire journalist who will actually show up and put it into the paper, which matters, although there is declining readership. Certainly on television, it is a lucky day, a cold day in, and I better not say “H-E double hockey sticks”, that we will actually see CTV and Global. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651155">I appreciate the journalists who come. They tell important stories, but they are few and far between because the private broadcasters do not want to drive an hour down to the valley. They sure as heck do not want to drive down to beautiful West Nova; it is too far from Halifax. However, reporters from CBC/Radio-Canada will show up, and that is important because they are telling the stories that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651156">We have to get back to editorial capacity and resources in the regions. We have to focus on true Canadian content. I mentioned CBC's <I>Land and Sea</I>, <I>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</I> and other documentaries that are focused on Canadian content. I am sorry, but we do not need a Canadian <I>Family Feud</I>. We do not need Americanized content in which we put lipstick on a pig and call it Canadian. That is where I think, at times, the public broadcaster has lost its way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651157">I want to take the opportunity to talk about my concern about the opposition cutting public broadcasting. We have established that, in many cases, it is our public broadcaster, on television and certainly on radio, that provides really important news and content information. There are many places where we have, essentially, media deserts where the private sector either does not have a business model to do it or has not been able to find a way. The public broadcaster matters for news and information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651158">There are many constituents in my riding who believe in this important work. We have the Conservatives saying that they would cut it. They would cut this in an era of social media and of algorithms. I do not understand why. I want to go back to the bigger narrative. It is not just the CBC the Conservatives want to cut. They want to denigrate media and journalism across the board. I asked this in the House a few weeks ago: Which news agencies are the Conservatives not going to try to denigrate? Which ones do they trust?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651159">When I watch Vassy Kapelos take a hard stance on a cabinet minister in the current government, I do not think that CTV is a propaganda arm for the government. I do not think it is appropriate for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> to stand in this place and attack CEOs with his parliamentary privilege to try to downgrade the stocks of Canadian companies that Canadians have in their retirement plans. That is irresponsible leadership. It is a symbolic element of where the Conservative Party has ended up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651160">Are there good, honourable members on the other side whom I believe in? There absolutely are. However, under the leadership of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, the Conservative Party does not have the true progressive and moderate Conservative views that I think have resonated with people in this country for a long time. What do George Nowlan, Joe Clark and Scott Brison all have in common? They represented the good people of Kings—Hants as true Progressive Conservatives, and that party does not exist anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651161">My message to my constituents is very clear when they look at the modern Conservative Party of today. I will say that I was not a huge fan of Stephen Harper. I did not agree with everything he did, but he looks like a heck of a statesman compared with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. My God, bring back Harper over that guy. The member for Carleton makes Stephen Harper look like an absolute statesman. That scares a heck of a lot of people in my riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651164">It scares people in my riding because they did not like Harper. Harper was the guy who called Atlantic Canada a culture of defeat. We were not pleased with Harper at the time. Can we guess what? My constituents say the guy from <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> is even scarier. He is further down the line, and he is trumpeting the same playbook that we are seeing more and more out of the United States from the Republican Party, or at least its presidential nominee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651165">We have to find a way to maintain broadcasting in this country and to maintain our public broadcasters. They tell important stories and make sure information gets to residents across the country, particularly in areas where the private media companies will not go. The Conservative agenda to cut the CBC and to cut our public broadcaster, with no conversation about reform, is absolutely irresponsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651166">Concerning the idea that the Conservatives' cutting CBC would not have an impact on Radio-Canada, I say this to my colleagues from Quebec: <I>C'est absolument fou</I>. It is crazy to think that there will not be an impact. Quebeckers know the importance of Radio-Canada. They ought to be careful.</ParaText>

Of course, I am only teasing my colleague. I essentially agree with him, especially the last part of his statement when he emphasized the importance of the francophone side of CBC/Radio‑Canada. I would like him to tell me what he thinks about this: When CBC/Radio‑Canada made its cuts, it cut the francophone and anglophone sides 50‑50, even though the francophone side is turning a very good profit. It is sad to say, but right now, the francophone side is pretty much keeping the anglophone side afloat.</ParaText>

In the Deputy Speaker's own riding of West Nova and in communities across the Maritimes, Radio‑Canada plays a vital role. If the Conservatives slash the CBC's resources, as they hope to do, it will undoubtedly affect Radio-Canada's efficiency and French-language services.

              <ParaText id="8651171">I listened very carefully to what he had to say. In his speech, he said that The Globe and Mail is a credible newspaper that always publishes relevant, fact-checked information. However, when the big SNC-Lavalin scandal happened, and the democratic tragedy of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s meddling in the judicial process for partisan reasons unfolded, The Globe and Mail broke what came to be known as the Jody Wilson-Raybould affair.

For example, we hear the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> talking about cutting and defunding the CBC but not Radio-Canada.

              <ParaText id="8651177"> I appreciate that the member spoke about the impacts and the importance for people in rural communities to have access to the CBC. The CBC also has stations that are in eight indigenous languages now. This is vital for Canadians, and we know that the majority of Canadians support public broadcasting. We need to make sure that we support the CBC and public broadcasting to be the best so that Canadians have the confidence they need, as the member said.

              <ParaText id="8651180">In my speech, I did not say that CBC is beyond reproach. Public broadcasting is fundamental in this country, but reform is also necessary. I completely agree with the member's sentiment about the reckless nature of the Conservatives talking about cutting public broadcasting in an environment in which we are being subjugated to algorithms, increasing social media and disinformation. This is not just from content users, necessarily, but also from foreign states.

I repeat that, in my neck of the woods, it is called complete hypocrisy.</ParaText>

From the emails in my inbox, the constituents in the riding of Waterloo wholeheartedly support a public broadcaster. They recognize that we can do better, as can the CBC, but they fear the Conservative approach of just cutting programs and services available to Canadians. </ParaText>

The Conservatives are planning to cut our public broadcaster in this country at a time when rural and regional Canada need it even more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651187">Many of the members of Parliament on the opposition benches have constituents in areas where there would be very little to no local media at all. It is extremely important to maintain that public broadcaster; it is also important to focus on reform. Let us not suggest that the CBC has been perfect. I think now is a great opportunity to focus on how we reform our public broadcaster to meet the needs all across the country, including re-engaging communities very strongly in western Canada, where the presence is not what it needs to be. However, it does not help when the opposition party continues to denigrate our public broadcaster. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8651188"> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear a Liberal member, after nine years, realize the Liberals have now also broken the CBC. They broke housing. They have broken the criminal justice system. I can go down the list of what they have broken over the last several years, including when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke the English language by inventing the word “brokenist”, which was a treat for all of us to listen to just last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651189">What came out of the committee is this: Given the job cuts announced at CBC/Radio-Canada for the year 2024, it would be inappropriate for the CBC to grant bonuses to the executive members. Because the Liberals broke the CBC so badly with terrible appointments and terrible management, a committee had to take the unprecedented step of telling the CBC not to give out bonuses when they had performed so poorly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651190">It is really unheard of. This has not happened in the history of the CBC, so I have to wonder how the government so incompetently managed the CBC through the people it appointed to run it. The Liberals have done an absolutely abysmal job. They have run the CBC into the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651191">Viewership at the CBC has collapsed by 50% since 2018. In any other environment, say, if I had declined my goal production in hockey by 50%, I am guessing my team would not be giving me a bonus. I have never run an NHL team, but I cannot imagine a player going to the owner and saying, “I scored 40 goals last year. This year I scored 20. I want to talk about my bonus.” It just would not happen. However, because the Liberals are just so incompetent with everything, everyone now thinks they can do whatever they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651192">The CBC executives, because there is really no one running the ship over there, do not know what is going on. Their incompetence is spreading to every department. These people thought, “Let me think about this for a second. Viewership is down by 50%. We failed to meet 79% of our performance targets. Let me think of what we should do about that. I have an idea: let us cut 800 employees and give ourselves bonuses.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651193">This is the madness that is going on at the CBC, and it can only happen under the absolutely corrupt, bankrupt-of-ideas Liberal government. As we often say, a fish rots from the head down, and the rot from this government is spreading everywhere. It has spread so badly that Catherine Tait at the CBC thought this was a good idea. I can just see it now: They call everybody into the boardroom to pitch some ideas. Viewership is down 50%. They did not meet 79% of their KPIs. They go around the table to figure out the solution. They need to get things back on track. What if they cut 800 employees? “Oh yes, I like that.” What if they gave out $3.8 million in bonuses? “Oh yes, I like that. That is exactly the direction we need to go.” Then the Liberals stand here, do nothing and defend it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651194"> How the CBC is behaving is offensive to average Canadians, so the committee had to take the unprecedented step of saying the CBC should not be paying out bonuses while laying off people. The government did not say anything. Its members just said, “Well, whatever,” as they do on most files. They are out of touch, asleep at the switch and making a mess of everything. They made a mess of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651195">I want to go just on a bit more. Catherine Tait's salary is between $468,000 and $551,000 a year. That is a pretty good wage. Most Canadians would be really happy to make a wage like that. In fact, they would be happy to make a fifth of that. As the performance of the CBC was going into the tank, she decided bonuses were great and the bonuses could be up to 28%. She tanked viewership, they have not met any of their KPIs and missed 79% of them, and what she thought would really fix things up was giving herself a $154,000 bonus. I really cannot make this stuff up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651196"> Any average Canadian hearing this would say it has to be a joke, an article in The Beaverton or something like that. No corporation would behave this way except if it was being run by a really incompetent Liberal government. The government appointed people to the green slush fund who just paid themselves and their companies whatever they wanted. There is now an RCMP investigation. As I said, a fish rots from the head down. This Crown corporation sees that Crown corporation making it rain by sending its money to all its buddies' companies, and it wants to get in on that action and gives itself some gigantic bonuses. It is absolutely reprehensible conduct by a Crown corporation that is running itself into the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651197">The CBC dished out $18.4 million in bonuses to non-union staff and, wait for this, $3.3 million in bonuses to 45 executives. That is more than $73,000 each. After the CBC had given itself this wonderful Christmas present, these gigantic bonuses, it decided to give some employees at the CBC a Christmas bonus as well: It sent pink slips to 800 employees. That is what it decided was a good thing to do as it made it rain for itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651198">That is why a House of Commons committee took the unprecedented step to say this had to stop. We would think that if there was a decent minister over there, or a decent <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the government would have put a stop to that, but no, absolutely not, just like it did not put a stop to all the corruption at the green slush fund. The government let it go on for years despite all the warnings and all the questions at committee. It said these people can run amok and do whatever they want, and that has spread. It has now spread to the CBC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651199">Then where did the CBC go? It realized it missed 79% of its KPIs and people were questioning its bonuses. It asked, “Does anybody have any ideas what we should do? Should we try to actually do content that people want? Should we make sure our local affiliates are getting some coverage?” No. Someone put up their hand and said, “What if we just changed the KPIs so we all reach them? Then we can keep getting our bonuses.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651200">Again, we cannot make this up. When the CBC realized it could not meet any of its own KPIs but still wanted to make it rain for itself, it just changed the KPIs. Why would it do that? I go back again to this: A fish rots from the head down. The corruption that the government has engaged in for the last nine years has spread out all over the place, and people feel like they can do whatever, as a former member said, the “H-E double hockey sticks” they want. This is what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651201">The committee had to get into it and say it had absolutely had enough. If we look at the CBC itself, the bonuses alone have cost taxpayers $132 million since 2015. Think about that, $132 million, all while the CBC is missing all of its performance metrics. This is a corporation that has completely lost its moral compass in dealing with people. Imagine sending out layoff notices to 800 employees just before Christmas after giving these bonuses. It is the epitome of disgusting. If anything, the CBC should have been taking care of those workers as opposed to making it rain for itself with these exorbitant bonuses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651202">However, it did not happen, and there was no condemnation from the Liberals. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not say this was absolutely unacceptable and the CBC should reverse this decision—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651206">Mr. Speaker, 1,450 CBC staffers are taking home six-figure salaries. Since 2015, the number of CBC employees taking six-figure salaries has spiked by 231%, again, all the while, with absolutely declining viewership, not meeting any of their KPIs and giving themselves these lavish, gigantic bonuses. Catherine Tait has not ruled out taking more bonuses. It is really incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651207"> In the face of all this, a responsible CEO would say they have made some serious mistakes, they are running the corporation into the ground, they are going to turn this thing around, and the first thing that is going to happen is they are not going to take any bonuses until the ship gets going in the right direction. However, that is not what is happening. In the real world, all these executives would lose their jobs for this terrible performance, but in the Liberal world, they give themselves gigantic bonuses, pat themselves on the back and then lay off the workers. That is the record of the Liberal government with the CBC, which is, again, why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651208">I have heard members from the Liberal government say how dare we take up valuable House time to discuss this. I think Canadians want to know what the government has done to the CBC, how it has run it into the ground. I understand, when we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who says he admires the basic dictatorship of China, that he does not want debate in the House of Commons. That all tracks. I am sorry it is so inconvenient for Liberal members to have to try to get up and pathetically defend how they have run the CBC for the last nine years. I agree it is a hardship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651209">They actually have to stand up and defend their terrible record. However, they do not want to, so they say things like we are taking up House time. Parliament is here for a reason: to debate issues. If that is inconvenient for them, if they admire China's basic dictatorship so much, maybe there is somewhere they could go and and be dictators. There are lots of countries around the world they could move to with basic dictatorships, China being one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651210">We are going to debate this because it is important to Canadians to expose what they have done to the CBC, what the people at the CBC are doing to the workers at the CBC, and we are not going to stop. They can cry about it all they want. The facts are these: they cannot defend their management of the CBC; they cannot defend the bonuses the CBC has given to itself; they cannot defend that the CBC awarded itself these gigantic bonuses and then tried to lay off 800 workers; they cannot defend that viewership at the CBC is down 50%; they cannot defend that the CBC has not met 79% of its own KPIs and then gave itself bonuses; and they cannot defend the fact that, when the CBC realized how outrageous it was to give itself bonuses while missing 79% of its KPIs, it just changed the KPIs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651211">The CBC learned from the best. It learned from a corrupt Liberal government that says, “Just do whatever you want; everything will be fine.” That is how the CBC is being run under the Liberal government.</ParaText>

They also note that the discretion and interventions of the lighthouse keepers along the coastline have resulted in the rescue of many stranded and injured individuals, which would have not been possible through automation, and that Fisheries and Oceans Canada did not consult with local communities, mariners, union representatives or first nations prior to announcing the destaffing of Pachena Point and Carmanah Point light stations on the west coast of Vancouver Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651234">The petitioners are calling on the federal government to, in the future, consult with relevant stakeholders and first nations regarding the impacts of the destaffing; conduct an independent cost and safety assessment of both lighthouses and come back with a plan to move forward in reinstating the lighthouses that were closed; work with union representatives and consult with labour, as was promised in the past; and consider alternative actions to preserve the safety of lighthouse keepers without destaffing their stations.</ParaText>

Scientific evidence links these substances to severe health risks, including cancer, which is putting firefighters, who are already facing hazardous conditions, at greater risk. Research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues. Alarmingly, firefighters face a higher cancer risk than the general population. We must mitigate these risks by regulating what we can control in their working conditions. Several countries have restricted PFAS use. Canada must follow suit. Our firefighters deserve gear that is free from toxic chemicals.</ParaText>

This creates problems when those individuals might be applying for immigration to Canada.

They further want to see a mechanism whereby Hong Kong people with pro-democracy movement-related convictions not under the national security law could also be deemed admissible to Canada, notwithstanding the criminality provisions. They want to see Canada work with other like-minded states to have similar such provisions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8651287">Mr. Speaker, before going into more detail about the subject of today's debate, I would like to remind the House about what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said when he came to power in 2015. He made all kinds of promises about doing things differently. People tend to forget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651288">When the Prime Minister came to power in 2015, people said it was really a new era of hope, promises and dreams for Canadians. We all remember that. He walked in here acting like some sort of saint. He was a saint of a man. He was picture perfect. It was the dawn of a new era. The Prime Minister said he would act for the good of Canada and Canadians. However, it did not take long for him to fall back into old Liberal habits, but multiplied by 10 or 20. In fact, it is immeasurable. We have lost count of all the scandals and the money involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651289">It was clear that, once again, there were systems in place to to enrich the Liberals' cronies. We saw examples of their friends profiting from the federal government's largesse. Let us not forget that we are talking about taxpayers' money. I heard someone speaking earlier about the sponsorship scandal that happened back in the day. That was a $40‑million scandal, one that led to the Liberal government being defeated by the Conservatives, because the public was so upset by the scandal. However, considering what we have been living under for the past nine years, that was nothing. It is hard to imagine, but the sponsorship scandal was small potatoes compared to everything we have seen over the past nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651290">Unfortunately, some people seem to have gotten used to it. We are currently dealing with a $400‑million scandal, but so many billions of dollars have been wasted over the past nine years that people feel like $400 million is not such a big deal. We are talking about $400 million. That is 40% of a billion dollars, but today's billions are yesterday's millions. To some, $400 million may not sound like a lot of money, but I think it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651291">Let us come back to what the Prime Minister promised. At the time, he said he would do a lot for the environment, that the Liberals would really change the way things were done. That is how we ended up with this green fund thing. Instead of helping the environment, it helped friends of the Liberal Party of Canada. That is what happened. That has been proven. That is the scandal. We are not making this up. It is not a Conservative Party fabrication. It has been demonstrated and proven.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651292">The Liberals are asking why we Conservatives are not letting this go, why we keep talking about this. What should we do? Should we simply drop it and say that their friends received $400 million, but we will move on, it is no big deal, it is just taxpayers' money and we do not care? That is not how things work for people with morals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651293">The green fund is officially called Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC. As we know, the Auditor General found that this fund was being used as a slush fund for Liberal friends. There is a recording of a senior official speaking out against the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for inappropriately awarding contracts worth $390 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651294">The Auditor General also found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that, in some cases, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology. Another $334 million was paid out in 186 cases to projects in which board members had a conflict of interest. The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for this scandal falls on the Liberal government, which did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651295">The Speaker ruled that this Liberal government violated the order of the House requiring the government to turn over the documents related to this scandal to the police so that it can pursue a criminal investigation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651296">Last week, a journalist summarized this situation in the National Post. I will tell the House what he wrote. He was informed that the Liberals are still refusing to be transparent with Canadians. Here is what he wrote: “Withholding the information is significant because it appears to fly in the face of the Speaker's ruling...that the government likely had no right to do so”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651297">The article goes on: “The Liberal government is still providing redacted documents and withholding others on the so-called 'green slush fund' from the House of Commons nearly one month after [the] Speaker...scolded it for doing just that. In a letter tabled in Parliament Monday, Commons Law Clerk Michel Bédard told MPs that he had recently received new documents from three government departments relating to Sustainable Development Technology Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651298">The article goes on to say that, “In all three cases, information was withheld.... In June, three opposition parties banded together to pass a Conservative motion ordering the public service, the auditor general and SDTC to provide all documents on the latter to Bédard. The motion did not provide for any information to be redacted or withheld. The 'unprecedented' motion then called on Bédard to provide the documents to the RCMP.... 'The House has clearly ordered the production of certain documents, and that order has clearly not been fully complied with,' [the Chair] said in a Sept. [26] ruling.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651299">The article continues: “Because of that, [the Speaker] found he 'cannot come to any other conclusion but to find that a prima facie question of privilege has been established' and suggested the issue be sent to a committee for further study. In other words, [the Speaker] found the government had likely violated the Commons' 'absolute and unfettered' constitutional power to call for information.... In a report published in the spring, Auditor General Karen Hogan concluded that one out of six projects funded by [SDTC] that she audited were ineligible and that the organization had serious governance issues. On the day her audit was published, the government announced it was abolishing the fund and folding it into the National Research Council.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651300">This part of the article from the National Post published on October 21 provides a nice summary of what we have been saying for the past two weeks now. We are not letting this go because there is a clear, specific scandal and we have a government that is hiding and wants to keep hiding the information and is not sharing it with the police. The government can say what it wants, but there are enough facts to prove there is a scandal. Now we have to take this further. That is where we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651301">What is more, testimonies at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts about SDTC revealed a lot of information about Liberal corruption. A whistle-blower told us the following:</ParaText>

I am saying that, but I am not so sure. As I said earlier, $40 million was missing in the sponsorship scandal when the government ended its term in office. We are at $400 million for this scandal alone, not to mention the billions of dollars that were wasted in other scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651308">The Auditor General has her work cut out for her because it never stops. Every time she looks into something, she ends up writing a scathing report.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651309">I do not think that the Auditor General has published even one report in recent years that said that there was nothing to see and that everything was fine. There is always a problem. Last week, she confirmed that her office was launching an investigation on GC Strategies. Does everyone remember that? As I was saying earlier, memory has a way of fading quickly in our Parliament and around the Hill. However, we remember GC Strategies and the little ArriveCAN app.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651310">The Auditor General is starting her investigation because, as we know, the Liberal government has given the people behind GC Strategies $100 million since the member for Papineau became <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Many of those contracts were sole sourced, which means that government representatives awarded multi-million contracts directly to that company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651311">For the ArriveCAN app alone, GC Strategies pocketed $20 million in taxpayer funds when it should have cost just $80,000. We talked about that at great length last spring, and it is not over. Accordingly, the Auditor General agreed to audit all payments received by GC Strategies as well as all Government of Canada contracts awarded to the company outside the ArriveCAN fiasco. Oddly enough, ArriveCAN was just one among many other contracts that the company received since this government took power in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651312">GC Strategies and its partners became multi-millionaires under the Liberal government. They admitted that they were paid up to $2,600 an hour for recruitment and that they invoiced the government as many as 1,500 times a month. It must be something to have a company like that, a company that can invoice the government 1,500 times a month and hire a full-time employee to do nothing but send out invoices. If no light bulbs went on in anyone's head at that point, this country has one heck of a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651313">GC Strategies was founded in 2015, as I said, and started receiving contracts within a few weeks. We have the dates. It was a few weeks after this government came to power on November 4, 2015. In the past year alone, more and more revelations have come to light about the unethical behaviour of those folks. They bragged about their close ties to government officials and were hauled before the bar of the House of Commons to answer questions after refusing to appear before a committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651314">Earlier this year, the RCMP raided the home of GC Strategies founder Kristian Firth as part of the investigation into the ArriveCAN app. Canadians deserve a government that will treat their tax dollars and the public purse with respect. Only common-sense Conservatives will continue to fight to get to the bottom of how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave millions of dollars to this shady company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651315">This brings me to the green fund scandal, the slush fund, the $400 million that was given to friends. The Auditor General is about to begin her investigation into GC Strategies, which, over the past nine years, with the new company, has been awarded $100 million in contracts, oddly enough, including $20 million for the notorious little ArriveCAN app.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651316">This also leads us to rethink everything that has happened over the past nine years. Here is what history will remember about this Prime Minister's record: a legacy of scandals. At least, that is what I will remember. If I were to write a book, it would be the story of scandals, plural. The title would be something that talks about this Prime Minister's legacy: scandal after scandal after scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651317">I want to go back in time. Let us think of the Aga Khan's island. The Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner issued a report. I think this was the first time ever that a Prime Minister was the subject of a Ethics Commissioner report in which he was directly blamed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651318">Then, the Prime Minister fired the justice minister, Ms. Wilson-Raybould, because she did not help SNC-Lavalin circumvent the law. We spent weeks and months talking about the SNC-Lavalin scandal in the House. A lot of people seem to have forgotten that, but Ms. Wilson-Raybould has not, and neither have I.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651319">There was the WE Charity scandal. That amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. WE Charity is the organization that used government money to directly help the Prime Minister. I am not going to go into the details, but that is another one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651320">Another scandal that kind of slipped under the radar happened during the pandemic. At the time, as the Conservative Party's procurement critic, I was responsible for monitoring procurement files related to what was going on in the midst of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651321">What the government did was take Canada's PPE stockpile and send it to China. At one point, when I said we were going to need that stuff, people told me I was racist. I do not know what that has to do with it, but whatever. We sent our PPE to China. What happened next? Two or three weeks later, we ran into problems. We needed PPE, but we no longer had it because we had sent everything to China.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651322">What did the government do next? They made new friends. Who could forget Tango Communication Marketing and the Brault family, the sponsorship scandal and the $80-million contract to bring masks in. When the masks arrived, they were garbage. People could not even use them. What did the government do about it? They said, oh well, the money has already gone to the Chinese. The second scandal we heard about after that is that it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to destroy the $80 million worth of masks that were never used. The scandals just keep piling up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651323">Among the government's friends is former MP Frank Baylis, who offered to supply 10,000 ventilators for $226 million during the pandemic. Everyone said we did not need 10,000 machines. After all, we do not have 10,000 emergency rooms in hospitals to operate them. On top of that, the market cost to build those machines should have been $100 million less than that. In committee, Mr. Baylis was asked how he justified charging Canadian taxpayers $226 million for machines that should have cost $125 million at most. The committee heard all kinds of answers, including that it had to do with administrative costs or the cost of keeping staff on. It was nonsense, and everyone knows it. Despite that, the money was paid out, and taxpayers footed the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651324"> We could talk about McKinsey, which suddenly started getting over $100 million in contracts for things like writing phony reports that served no purpose. We tried to understand why, but we could never grasp the point of it all. Even though an extra 100,000 employees had been added to the public service and experts were at the government's disposal, ready to offer it advice and submit proposals on various policies, the government chose to give the money to its friends, the McKinsey gang. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651325"> There has been no shortage of scandals. Eventually, they all blend into one mind-boggling mess. As I said earlier, memories fade, unfortunately. Today, this is where we are, after nine years of this government. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office, he told us that he was going to be perfect, the best in the world, that Canada was back, and that everything was going to be great. After nine years of this government, it is hard to fathom how we reached this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651326">The country's debt has doubled. The interest alone costs $50 billion a year. Now we have another scandal in which $400 million was given to friends for a program that was supposed to help the environment. This is like the election promise to plant two billion trees. The Liberals claimed to be so green that they were going to plant two billion trees. People who heard that on the news said it was a good idea. I do not know how many trees they have planted so far, but it is nowhere near two billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651327">Back to the green technology program. Conservatives are in favour of green tech. Conservatives support investing in green tech to protect our environment. However, instead of doing things that help people, as the Prime Minister promised in 2015, the government gave $400 million to its friends, who did nothing with that money. That is money wasted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651328">We know that we are going nowhere with this government, and that is why we are at the point where this government must go. I have another 10 pages of scandals. It gets old after a while, but we have a duty to remind everyone of all of this. If we do not do it, no one will, and people will forget. That is why we are here today, to keep the pressure up and to stay the course. We must never accept corruption. We must never accept the idea of giving out millions of dollars, maybe even billions over the course of nine years, left and right to Liberal friends. When we ask why things cost more, we cannot accept “because that is how things work” as an answer. This needs to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651329">I can confirm that a Conservative government will restore order in this country. It could be in the coming weeks or in the coming months at most, or so I hope. A Conservative government will put a stop to giving people millions of dollars. When we ask the government why this is happening, we can no longer accept the answer that that is just how it is and that we need to move on. This needs to stop. Let us hope that there will be a change in government soon.</ParaText>

Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Canadian women. As a two-time survivor of breast cancer, first diagnosed at age 42, I know first-hand about the importance of early detection. That is why I have long advocated for reducing the screening age from 50 to 40 in Canada so that women do not have to wait for mammography testing but rather have a choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651352"> I encourage all provinces to follow the lead of the United States, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Yukon, which have already reduced mammography screening to age 40. The Liberals agree and so does the Canadian Cancer Society that we need new national benchmarks to ensure that women across the country have access to early screening and detection.</ParaText>

Its lawyers even said, “Canada doesn't stop you from helping yourself.” On the one hand, Liberals in Parliament say that all first nations deserve clean drinking water, while on the other, Liberal-hired lawyers say in court that these are not statements that should be taken seriously.</ParaText>

It has now been 1,338 days since the Liberals promised to eliminate all long-term boil water advisories, with no end in sight. In my riding, Shamattawa First Nation and Tataskweyak Cree Nation are fighting the Liberals over that failure. The tap water in Berens River has been brown since May and is a danger to people's health, including people on dialysis.</ParaText>

This document paints a picture of the problems encountered by the unemployed. Through their stories, they share the many ways the system has failed them. It is an unfair, outdated federal program that the Liberal government has repeatedly promised to reform, yet it has done nothing.

              <ParaText id="8651603">I am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised on October 7, by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> concerning public access to Parliament Hill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651604">In her intervention, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> alleged that an officer of the Parliamentary Protective Service, PPS, prevented a member of the public from accessing the grounds of Parliament Hill, ostensibly because of his political ideology. This interaction was videorecorded and then posted to social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651605">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> argued that the officer was applying some sort of political test by which a person would be barred from accessing the parliamentary precinct if they did not support a particular cause, in this case relating to Palestine.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651606"> The member contended that in similar circumstances, if a member of Parliament had refused to identify themselves as a “supporter of Palestine”, they would have also been barred from the Hill, constituting a breach of their right of access to the parliamentary precinct. She concluded by declaring that no member or individual should be denied access to the grounds of Parliament Hill because of the political views they hold. The issue should therefore be considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651607">The <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the government House leader</Affiliation> countered that no member of Parliament was impeded in accessing the precinct nor, in fact, involved in the incident. Therefore, there was no question of privilege. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> made a similar argument, pointing out that the fundamental right of access to the precinct free of obstruction is enjoyed by members of Parliament. It does not extend to members of the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651608">The Chair will first address the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>'s assertions that members' privileges were breached because of the interaction that occurred between a PPS officer and an individual on October 5, 2024. The Chair will then provide members with some information on the administrative protocol for the use of Parliament Hill's front lawn by various groups for organized demonstrations and other types of events.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651609">As stated in <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, on page 110, and I quote, “In circumstances where Members claim to be physically obstructed, impeded, interfered with or intimidated in the performance of their parliamentary functions, the Speaker is apt to find that a prima facie breach of privilege has occurred.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651610">In those cases, there must be demonstrable evidence that a member, or the House collectively, was impeded in fulfilling their duties for a prima facie question of privilege to be found. <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, on page 148, also states, “In deliberating upon a question of privilege, the Chair will take into account the extent to which the matter complained of infringed upon any Member's ability to perform his or her parliamentary functions or appears to be a contempt against the dignity of Parliament.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651611">Recently, in another ruling on September 23, 2024, which can be found at page 25726 of the Debates, the Chair stated, “The member must demonstrate, concretely, how they, or the House, were impeded in the discharge of their functions, and, most important, that evidence exists as to the material interference.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651612">To this I can add that any alleged breach of privilege that is being complained of must be an actual breach, not a hypothetical one. While members' freedom of access to the Hill is well documented in many precedents, none of these suggest that this privilege extends to public access to the Hill for demonstrations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651613">With these important principles in mind, the Chair examined the events of October 5, 2024. After reviewing the video on social media that captures a portion of the interaction and consulting the House security partners, the Chair cannot conclude that members were denied access to the parliamentary precinct, nor was the situation related to any proceeding of Parliament. This is therefore not a prima facie question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651614">Before concluding, the Chair would like to share with members some additional information about organized demonstrations and other types of events on the front lawn of Parliament Hill. By default, the grounds of Parliament Hill are open to the public. The front lawn is also accessible to those who wish to organize a demonstration to highlight a particular cause or political concern. We are all used to seeing demonstrations on the front lawn and in the vicinity of the precinct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651615">Decisions about the use of the grounds of Parliament Hill are made under the authority of the Committee on the Use of Parliament Hill. The committee is co-chaired by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms and the Senate Director of Corporate Security, on behalf of their respective Speakers. Its membership also includes representatives of various government departments. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651616">A key consideration for this group is to ensure that any use of the grounds remains peaceful and incident-free and to protect the safety of all visitors to the Hill and those who work in the precinct. I can assure all members that this protocol is entirely administrative and that no member of Parliament, nor the Speaker, is involved in the operation of this protocol.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651617">Groups that want access to Parliament Hill for specific activities, such as holding a public demonstration, must first obtain authorization from the Committee on the Use of Parliament Hill. The committee reserves the right to change the conditions included in a public event permit. It can also cancel activities for security reasons, or even refuse permits on that basis.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651618">On the day in question, a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators had requested and received permission to organize an event. A space on the front lawn was designated for their demonstration, and the members of their group and sympathizers with their cause were directed to that space as they arrived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651619">Anyone present on the Hill that day could access the grounds. Pro-Palestinians demonstrators were directed to one area, while the general public and any counter-demonstrators were directed away from the grounds where the demonstration was taking place. Other parts of the front lawn and other parts of the precinct remained accessible to visitors. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8651620">To be clear, the events from that day followed well-established guidelines, which are in place to ensure the safety of everyone wishing access to Parliament Hill, including the demonstrators, any counter-demonstrators and the general public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651621">At no time was there any general directive to refuse access to the Hill on the basis of political views. The PPS followed its operational guidelines pertaining to the often challenging situations that they face daily. These guidelines are in place to preserve the safety and security of all people present on Parliament Hill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651624">Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people of Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651625"> It is generally a pleasure to speak in the House of Commons, but today is a difficult day. Before I begin my speech, I want to recognize a Toronto police officer, Constable Todd Baylis. He died as a young man on June 16, 1994. People may be wondering why I am raising this in my speech. It is because the person who killed Constable Baylis and attempted to kill his partner, Constable Michael Leone, who was also injured, is up for parole today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651626">I was listening to the victim impact statements by Constable Leone and by Constable Baylis's family, and they were very heart-wrenching. Constable Baylis was shot execution style. The offender then tried to kill Constable Leone, but the gun jammed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651627"> Sometimes we forget that police officers, including the ones on the parliamentary precinct here with the PPS, put themselves in harm's way all the time, and when they do so, they are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. Therefore I do want to recognize the case. I will be watching the parole hearing very closely. As was mentioned in the victim impact statements, I do not know how somebody who killed a police officer and attempted to kill another police officer execution style got to minimum-security prison, but that is for another day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651645">The scandal is 10 times larger than the sponsorship scandal, which I am sure many Liberals will remember. I certainly remember, as a young man who was interested in politics, looking at the sponsorship scandal and how it brought down a Liberal government. However, it was not just the money; it was also the hubris. We fast-forward many years later, about 20 years by my count, and the same hubris is really revealing itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651646">Let us make no mistake: This is theft, but it is theft of the worst kind. It is theft from the government or theft from the state. I have dealt with a lot of people who have stolen. Many people have stolen in one way or another in their lifetime. Obviously people are entitled to chances and sometimes second chances. Sometimes people are driven to steal by addiction. It is not uncommon that if somebody walks into court, especially into remand court, they will hear stories of somebody who says they have such a substantial addiction that they break into houses or that when they drink they assault their partner.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651647"> This does not make what they do right. It is still very wrong, but one tends to understand the role that substance abuse plays as one of the salient factors in offending. We can juxtapose theft by somebody who has an addiction to substances, or even an addiction to gambling, with theft from the government, theft from the taxpayer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651648">I wonder how many people in Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo it would take, what the average tax burden would be, if we were to divide $400 million by that number of people. For the average taxpayer, how many taxpayers, or how many families of taxpayers, would it take to get to $400 million?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651649"> It is like these scandals mean nothing when we get into the millions for these Liberals. They will say that it is just $56 million for the ArriveCAN scandal, so it is no big deal. There are a few million here, a few million there. It just does not seem to matter. There is this theft from the government, and there is the arrogance, the hubris. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651650">One of the greatest problems here is that this was, from what I can see, pure greed. In my view, that is the worst type of offence. We had people who were sophisticated. They were often business people. The chair and the many others who did wrong had been appointed by the Liberal government. What did they do? They lined their own pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651651">Unlike the situation for the person who has been driven to offend based on external factors, from what I can see, this was pure greed. This was business people who sought to line their own pockets and make even more money. They did this on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. That is bad enough. Worse, the Liberals do not want to provide the documents. We have people who were stealing, and they were stealing out of greed. They are rich people who were seeking to get richer. The Liberals are seeming to say that those are their kind of people and that they do not want to provide the documents. The Liberals not only not want to provide documents, particularly unredacted, but also are prepared to go against a House order to provide those documents. It pays to be a Liberal these days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651652">This is so wrong. This is absolutely so wrong. As a former prosecutor, I can tell members that, if somebody has to give things to the police, if they are representing a bank or a credit union and somebody has defrauded them, do members know what they do? They give the documents to police. I have seen so many Liberals stand up to make fallacious, dubious and specious arguments about how the documents should or should not be delivered. If somebody is a victim of the crime, do members know what they do? They go to the police to say that they have been a victim of a crime and that this is the evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651653">There was one Liberal who actually responded to this because I asked a question about charter rights. I have an idea of how the Liberals, at least some of them, would make the argument. I would love for one to actually make the argument so that I could see what they are thinking on this. They essentially say that people have a right to not be a witness, that we should not have people's finances exposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651654"> I agree. It would be wonderful if that were not the case, but sometimes we witness a crime. If we witness a crime, sometimes we have to go to court to testify. I should not say nobody but, in my experience, few people show up to court and say that they cannot wait to testify, that it is so great that they are not at work, not with their family, and that they would much rather be in court. Very few people ever say that. Why is that? It is because people do not want to be victims. They do not want to be witnesses, but what do we have? We have these documents that would disclose criminal wrongdoing. They would disclose criminal offences.

The people who stole this $400 million, who committed fraud, are not part of the middle class.

              <ParaText id="8651657">I am attempting to get more doctors to my riding. I cannot say what $400 million would do to aid in that effort. What would $400 million do, when about 50% of the people in Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo do not have a family doctor? It would be easy to point my finger to say it is the province's problem, but when I get a letter or two a day from people saying, “I am eight months pregnant”, or “I need a hip replacement, and I have been waiting”, I can only get so many of those letters and not act. That is why I have decided to show off the wonderful nature of Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo. I believe in the people who are coming to my riding who are doctors. They might be from overseas and looking to immigrate to Canada to live the same dream that my parents and I lived. Four hundred million dollars could certainly go a long way there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651658">What about food and poverty? Our food banks in Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo are stretched thin. I know this because I visit them regularly. In fact, I was at Kamloops Food Bank within the last couple of months. I was also at the 100 Mile House Food Bank not long ago. The numbers of people at both have skyrocketed. Members can imagine what $400 million could do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651660">What are we left with? We are left with 186 conflicts of interest. For those at home who do not know, a conflict of interest is when a person is acting on something and they, or someone else, could benefit. There are actual conflicts of interest, as in, “I will benefit from this or I could benefit”. Then there are what we call “apparent conflicts of interest”, where it just looks like somebody could benefit. From what I can see, these seem like actual conflicts, but who knows. Some may have been apparent. There are 186 of them. These were committee members who owned their own businesses and essentially said, “You scratch my back, and I will scratch yours. Together, we will all get rich.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651661">Then it came time for accounting, for there to be a reckoning and for Parliament to follow the law. Parliament is not encumbered by the laws that might be in other statutes. We have our own process here to produce documents. The Speaker can order that, and that is exactly what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651662">When the Liberals talk about their respect for institutions, they say, “Oh, we just love our institutions, and the Conservatives just want to drag them down”, but what about the institution of Parliament? Where is the respect for that institution to turn over the documents they were ordered to turn over? There is no respect for the institution of Parliament when they stand up to say, “We are going to defy the Speaker's orders.” Where is the respect for that institution?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651663">It is made even more egregious when we think about the wrongdoing, but the Liberals will say not to worry because they are working for those in the middle class and those who are trying to join it. What message does this send? That $400 million, and even if it were $400, $4,000, $4 million, I do not care what it is, we have just lost track of it.</ParaText>

They were both with their parents. In my mom's case, her dad left home for, I believe, five years. I bet my mom could not even remember her dad when she saw him at seven years old. She had not seen him since she was two years old. This was not a time when people could just Skype one another, FaceTime or even talk on the phone. For those people who sacrificed so much, what does $400 million mean to them? What does it mean when the Liberals will not turn over the documents?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651666">Parliament has ground to a halt. It is no surprise that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is the first sitting prime minister to ever be found guilty of breaching conflict of interest legislation. In fact, he did it not once but twice. He stayed in what think was a $9,000-a-night hotel room, and what was his talking point? He said that, like many people, he stayed with family over the holidays. Most people do not have friends with $9,000-a-night hotels. However, that was not a conflict of interest. It is tone deaf. It is completely out of touch, but it was ruled, I believe, to not be a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651667">It just shows, though, the mentality, and the Liberal government stands for this. The Liberals are okay with it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> hopped on a helicopter and went to a private island. Liberals are saying that is okay and that they will still stand behind him. Well, maybe not, as apparently 24 will not stand behind him. This is not a person who is in touch with the middle class and those attempting to join it, and this is not a party in touch with the middle class and those hoping to join it. Otherwise, it would be providing the documents instead of defying the order of the Speaker, who said to provide those documents. </ParaText>

When we look at the nature of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and what he has done, it is no surprise we are here. This is somebody who fired the first indigenous attorney general and minister of justice. What did she do? She dared to stand up to him. At the time, I think obstruction of justice was a straight, indictable matter. In other words, one of the most serious types of crime. He asked her to look the other way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651669">Obstruction of justice is attempting to pervert, defeat or obstruct the course of justice. To obstruct justice, someone does not actually have to be successful. It is one of the few crimes where, apart from attempted murder, I suppose, someone does not have to follow through with it. They do not have to be successful. It is just the attempt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651670">What did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do? He told this person that she needed to give a deferred prosecution agreement to Liberal friends. Can members imagine if somebody were to go up to a prosecutor to say that a person was a friend of theirs and that they needed to give them a break? Can members imagine if a politician did that? That would be obstruction of justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651671">However, this is not just an ordinary person. This is not a small town mayor. It is not even a member of parliament, an MLA or a minister.

Perverting, obstructing and defeating the course of justice is exactly what the Prime Minister did, yet he stands here today. He comes into the House to say that they are not going to comply. He also will not comply with calling a carbon tax election. </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As it stands, the motion was adopted. The House has clearly ordered the production of certain documents, and that order has clearly not been fully complied with. The Chair cannot come to any other conclusion but to find that a prima facie question of privilege has been established. However, before inviting the House leader of the official opposition to proceed with the moving of a motion, I would like to make a few comments on the type of motion the Chair would consider to be appropriate in the circumstances.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651726">We know the outcome. The Speaker of the House ruled in favour the question of privilege. That is why we have been discussing this subject for nearly a month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651727">It was clear. The order requiring the government to produce a series of unredacted documents related to this organization was passed by a majority of MPs on June 10. We owe it to ourselves to be transparent. Occasionally, as the official opposition, we are criticized for using the tools at our disposal. This one is written in the books, and the invaluable table officers reference the House of Commons procedures every day to ensure that we comply with those procedures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651728">For several years, SDTC has been embroiled in a Liberal scandal known as the “green slush fund”. These documents were supposed to be handed over to the RCMP, but the government failed to comply with the order of the House and still refuses to do so. What got us to this point was the Auditor General's conclusion that SDTC officials broke conflict of interest laws 186 times and funnelled $400 million of taxpayers' money to their own companies. That is $400 million of Canadians' hard-earned tax dollars ending up in the pockets of Liberal government cronies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651729">Let us break down how that $400 million was wasted. The Auditor General is not a member of the official opposition, nor is she a member of the second or third opposition party. She is not an independent MP or some ordinary person. The Auditor General is the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651730">Ten ineligible projects were awarded $58 million. Those projects did not meet the eligibility criteria. None of them could demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology despite that being one of the eligibility criteria. Those projects got money anyway. In 186 cases, $334 million was allocated to projects that put board members in a conflict of interest. I repeat: in 186 cases, the projects were linked to board members. Where I come from, and in the Conservative Party, we call that a conflict of interest. Another $58 million was awarded to projects that did not comply with the terms and conditions of the contribution agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651731">That is how the $400 million was spent. Keep in mind that those are the Auditor General's numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651732">This is my third term of office and I could write volumes on the number of scandals, the mismanagement, and the lack of management by this government, which has been in power since I arrived in the House of Commons. The government has been in power for nine years. If we listen to Canadians, people are fed up, exhausted, and impoverished. They want an election. However, the obstruction continues with the help of the NDP and the Bloc Québécois. The Bloc Québécois seems to have changed its mind today. Time will tell, but Bloc members have little to show for their ultimatum, which ends today. During his presentation, I asked the Bloc Québécois <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> what would happen on the morning of October 30. We will return to that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651733">This government is asking us to stop doing our work to help it move forward. I will give an example. At the Standing Committee on Official Languages, we moved a motion to understand the process that led to the appointment of the current Governor General, who was chosen by this government that claims to be a defender of the French language and to have concern for both official languages here in Canada. However, it appointed a Governor General who does not speak French, one of the two official languages of our beautiful country, Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651734">I just wanted to share that information. Nearly 80% of Canadians care about bilingualism, but when we talk about bilingualism, we are talking about French and English. It is unique to our country. We need to protect this bilingualism. It is a strength that attracts people who have the chance to be able to use both languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651735">We wanted to understand how this was done because it is a mystery and we moved a motion in committee. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651736">It was a bunch of insiders who decided among themselves to appoint a governor. In SDTC's case, a bunch of insiders decided to pad the pockets of Liberal cronies. We have seen this before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651737">The Liberals were in committee, supported by the NDP. They said there was not enough time to discuss this or it was not the right time to discuss it. When will it be time to discuss it? The government keeps putting this off, and now it is criticizing us for doing our job. It is accusing us of acting in bad faith. True, if we did not do that, we would not be doing our job. This is another example of this government's lack of judgment and lack of respect. I find that troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651738">That is not to impugn Ms. Simon's competence or skills. Anyone here in the House chosen to be Governor General would have agreed to learn French. It is perfectly understandable. I can vouch that learning a second language is no easy feat. I can attest to that. I try, but I make no claim to be bilingual. Ms. Simon is a person of good faith and a good Canadian, and she is entitled to respect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651739">She is not the problem. The problem is the appointment process. This government says that it will not delve deeply into the matter or disclose the procedures it followed for all Canadians to see. I will leave it to Canadians to be the judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651740">As a staunch defender of the French fact, I am pleased to contribute to the official languages file and to have been a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, whose work included the modernization of the legislation that received royal assent in June 2023. Reaching the point of royal assent, however, was quite an undertaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651741">Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> is another example of this government's botched work. I will give two examples. The act that received royal assent in June 2023 contains two orders in council. The first gives the Commissioner of Official Languages the tools to impose monetary penalties, in other words, fines. It is October 29, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, just before Halloween 2024, which means it has been over a year since it received royal assent. However, no one on the other side of the House, from the government side, can tell me when the order will be tabled. Since the Liberals claim to care about both official languages and the French fact, that is not very impressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651742">Part 2 of the act will also come into force as soon as an order is tabled and approved by cabinet. This order establishes the implementation of part 2 of the Official Languages Act on the right to work in the language of one's choice. Once again, it has been radio silence. There is no timeline for when the order will be tabled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651743">I will add that there are regulations that need to be written in the application of the law. Does anyone know how long it is going to take to write the regulations? It will take a third of the time of the revision, or three and a half years. Is it normal, where there is the will and the intent to protect both official languages, to have brought in legislation and say that it is going to take three and a half years to write the regulations? That is the action of people who do not have the will and the intent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651744">My question is simple. When will the government ensure that French is respected here in Canada, which, until further notice, is a bilingual country that uses French and English?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651745">Let us not forget that. Also at the Standing Committee on Official Languages in May and June, the Liberals doggedly protected one of their own and blocked the committee's work for more than seven meetings. They did this to protect one of their friends, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278491" Type="2">Glengarry—Prescott—Russell</Affiliation>, who said witnesses from Quebec were full of something I will not mention here. There is a disconnect within the party. The Liberals are the ones filibustering. The Liberals are the ones preventing us from getting things done. In my opinion, they like it that way because they do not know what to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651746">If they really wanted to get down to business and run our country, they would simply produce the documents. It would take a day, maybe two, at most, and then we could move on, but no, they want to blame us for what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651747">As I said, according to procedure, there is a process. There are rules. This was confirmed by the Speaker of the House. What I am saying is that it would be so simple to produce the documents. The Liberals' argument as to why they are not doing so is that the RCMP wants the documents, does not want the documents, wants some of the documents or wants the documents this way or that way. That is not important. The important thing is that the House ordered this government to provide unredacted documents. The RCMP will do what it wants with them afterwards. All we want is for the government to abide by the Speaker's order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651748">Several years ago, we had the Gomery commission. I am sure members will remember that. It was the 2004 Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program and Advertising Activities that was tasked with getting to the bottom of the sponsorship scandal. It smacked of corruption, and the same thing seems to be happening here in the House of Commons in 2024. Once again, this government is trying to protect itself. What is it trying to protect itself from? If the Liberals are so honest and transparent, all they have to do is produce the documents. It is not complicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651749">The list of things that make us doubt their honesty is long. As I mentioned, I have been an MP since 2015. One of my colleagues, Frank Baylis, was elected in 2015. We went through the pandemic and, in 2019, Mr. Baylis chose not to run again. As luck would have it, he became an expert on respirators. He quickly gained access to government contracts to sell respirators. These are public funds. What is there to hide? This is a great opportunity for Liberal friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651750">Of course, a series of events over the past nine years come to mind. I will list them briefly. There was the Aga Khan's island trip, for which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty. There was the abuse of protocol activities in India. There were the Jamaica vacations, ArriveCAN, SNC-Lavalin, McKinsey, partisan judicial appointments, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651751">While Liberal friends are getting richer, the cost of living has skyrocketed. Canadians do not need to be poorer. They have a right to know. I think it would be a significant gesture on the part of the Liberals, after the months that have gone by and been wasted, to proceed with the tabling of these documents and respect the hard-working Canadians who are striving for a better quality of life in Canada. It is all part of the process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651754">I say that because of how the Conservatives have changed.

              <ParaText id="8651760">French is indeed under threat. This weekend, I learned something that I never knew before, which is that French is the 17th most spoken language in Toronto and about the eighth most spoken language in Calgary and Edmonton. It is not doing too well. It is not doing too well in Quebec either. All the indicators are red. The Official Languages Act promises to send $700 million over the next five years to Quebec's anglophone community. How much is being sent to Quebec's endangered francophone community? Just $50 million. Anglophones represent 8% of the population and are under no threat whatsoever in North America, but they get $700 million, while only $50 million can be spared to protect French.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651801">Probably everybody in this room, which is packed full of people, has been on many boards and in many agencies. When people are on boards and in agencies, they go through training about what to do on a board. They get training about ethics, procedures and conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651802"> I remember as a mayor, we had a banker as a councillor. That banker knew if we talked about anything to do with banks, they were not at that meeting and were excused for that reason. They did not want to be in a conflict of interest. We have all been in situations and have learned that. We know that, yet we had a board that would have gone through training, made up of members who had had experience. I am sure they would not have been on that board if they did not have that kind of knowledge. Then we had bureaucrats sitting there, senior bureaucrats, at meeting after meeting, not saying, “Board members, I think we have an issue here. You need to reconsider what you are doing here.” Those bureaucrats did not stop them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651803"> It is problematic when we have board members who I am sure were experienced, who came from the private sector, from non-profits. They understood what it means to be a board member and what due diligence is, and they were dealing with $1 billion of taxpayers' money that we needed for innovation in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651804">The Auditor General looked at a few of those contracts. She looked at a few, and almost $400 million of taxpayers' money went through votes in ways that should not have happened. That money went in a different direction than it should have. That is very drastic. Not only did the University of Alberta's president say the university needed that innovative money in a proper way, and there are a lot of projects that need it, but the Premier of Alberta wrote a letter in support of the U of A president, asking the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> to consider carbon capture, hydrogen, critical minerals, and water and land reclamation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651805">We have the Premier of Alberta, along with the U of A president, saying that was the kind of resource money they need for innovation. Alberta innovates in co-operation with federal grants, and I have seen some of the projects. There were five projects done in the Calgary area. One was very curious; they were extracting carbon from the atmosphere, and they turned some of it into vodka. People asked, “How can you turn carbon into vodka?” Well, the consumers of vodka said it was one of the best out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651806"> Another one of the things they did, when we got innovation and grants handed out in the right way, was with cement. It takes fly ash to make cement, which has a huge green footprint, but they found a way to put carbon fibres in instead of fly ash, which reduced the carbon footprint. That is how Alberta innovates. That is how, with money from federal grants, in co-operation with researchers, they can produce changes that we are looking for in our environment. However, there were board members making decisions to spend taxpayers' money and give it to themselves by passing motions in an improper, unethical way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651807">That is one of the challenges we have with carbon tax. It is not directed into creating projects in our country. It is taking money away from people, and as the government says, 80% of it goes back to them. Well, what about not taking it away in the first place?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651808"> However, the carbon tax is really causing a problem in a different way, and most people do not talk about this. When we have school boards, such as mine or that of my neighbour beside me from Medicine Hat, which are very rural, we think of all the school buses that travel in those rural ridings and the amount of carbon tax that is paid by school boards for busing and buildings. The carbon tax on that is incredible. We can then take a look at what the carbon tax costs for all the health care facilities; it is not going to innovation. There are fewer teachers and fewer nurses. This is a problem with the carbon tax. It is handicapping our health care and our school systems with fewer staff, and it is not going into innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651809"> It is a problem when we have taxes misdirected, and we have a billion-dollar fund out there that was supposed to be giving contracts to people for innovation. However, what were they doing with it? They were giving it to each other for their own companies. When the slush fund approved $8.56-billion funding for 420 projects, only 58 of the projects were checked on, but they found a problem. In 90 separate cases, conflict of interest policies were not followed. How do they not follow these policies? How do the bureaucrats sitting in the room not say that they should take a look at the procedure and make sure they are following it? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651810">To expand on that, our great committee members exposed that, in the funding transactions approved by the board of directors during a five-year sampling, the Auditor General looked at 82% as conflicted. Wow, we are now up to hundreds of millions of dollars in conflicted decisions; this is why we are here. It is our job to hold the government to account for taxpayers' money. As some people have said, when we get to millions and hundreds of millions, people lose track of what that means to the average taxpayer. When my agricultural producers pay $100,000 in carbon tax, they know what $100,000 is. It hurts. When we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars, that is a big number. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651811">What is the timeline on the scandals? We have heard this before. We heard the member across the way referring to the Harper government. There may be some people on this side who were here at that time, but most of us were not. In talking about the time frame that we are in, the Liberals are in government; however, they try to explain that the people who were in power before did something wrong. They say it is all right when they are in power, and they should not be held accountable for it. However, the people in charge at the time are the people we hold to account. If it is the government in power now, then that is who we hold to account for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651812"> I remember the Vice-Admiral Norman case, which was a very brutal case. Our senior military navy official was really ruined by decisions of this particular cabinet. He was charged, but did he ever go to court? No, after the two years of his life being ruined, there was a settlement; it never went to court. That is how the Liberal government started out, with the Vice-Admiral Norman controversy. It is well documented. Members can find it if they research it. However, what upset me and many others was how they ruined a tremendous military man's career, his family and his life. That is how they started out in corruption, by ruining one of our significant military commanders of the navy in this country.</ParaText>

The Aga Khan scandal was strictly not understanding what most people understand: what is right and wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651815">There are still people who bring up the infamous India trip to me and ask why he was doing what he did in a number of ways on that trip. That was six years ago; we have still not recovered in the agricultural sector and trading. It has been brutal on the ag sector because India and Canada were trading partners in agriculture. That started to deteriorate because of the India trip in 2018. It was not the costumes alone that created a significant problem for us; it was also someone he brought with him: the terrorist at the dinner party. India is moving quickly to become the largest population in the world; it has power in agriculture that we need in trade. That was a brutal one.</ParaText>

She was a real politician, understanding what needed to be done and what was right and wrong.

              <ParaText id="8651842">I am very pleased to take part in today's debate on transparency and the sound management of public funds. Let us not forget that just over 20 years ago, Canada was gripped by a scandal that still reverberates today and likely will for decades to come. Of course, I am talking about the infamous sponsorship scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651843">Thanks to the hard work and sharp instincts of journalist Daniel Leblanc and his whistle-blower, known as “MaChouette”, a shameful ploy employed by the Liberal Party of Canada was exposed. Instead of awarding real contracts, the sponsorship program became a mailbox where people could send cheques to themselves in order to launder that money for partisan political purposes. This was what sadly became known as the sponsorship scandal. This led to an inquiry commissioned by Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin, a man who did the honourable thing by getting to the bottom of the matter. We know how that turned out. A total of $42 million of taxpayers' money was found to have been mismanaged by the heads of the sponsorship program, all to benefit the Liberal Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651844">Twenty years later, we are witnessing another highly compromising situation for friends of the Liberal Party regime. I mentioned a $42‑million scandal just now, but what we are talking about today involves not $42 million, or $100 million, or $200 million, or $300 million, but $390,072,774 that was improperly awarded to friends of the regime. It is not me, a Conservative MP, saying that. It is the Auditor General who conducted an exhaustive study of the financial documents and concluded that over $390 million had been mismanaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651845">This scandal began with a fund called the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, or SDTC. I am not a big fan of acronyms, but I may be using that one again. There were good intentions behind the creation of the fund in 2001. These stories always start with good intentions, but, as they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The problem is that sometimes people take shortcuts. That is what happened with the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, and it is absolutely scandalous. The fund was set up to distribute about $100 million of taxpayers' money every year to companies so they could develop new technologies to reduce their environmental footprint and pollution and help the environment. Unfortunately, it started off well but then veered drastically off course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651846">It was created by the Chrétien government in 2001. It continued under Harper's Conservative government and under the current government led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Papineau</Affiliation>. I would say his name, but I am not allowed. Some people say it is disrespectful to call the Prime Minister “the member for Papineau”, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is only here because there are people in Papineau who voted for him. In a few months, it is likely that people from Ottawa-Carleton will elect the Prime Minister. He will still be the MP for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation>. That is why we must always refer to the Prime Minister and any minister or House officer by their riding name, because without their riding, they would not be here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651847">Back to the main point. The program looked good, and it was off to a good start. In fact, the program was definitely well on its way and, for nearly two decades, it had fruitful results, funding things like high-tech solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable development technologies. It was created in 2001, as I said. In 2017, under the current Liberal government, the then auditor general conducted an investigation, an analysis, a study of this fund and gave it a very high passing grade.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651848">It was off to a good start. It was good, and it was working. It worked until 2017. That is when the problems started. In 2019, the former minister of innovation, science and economic development, the Hon. Navdeep Bains, decided to appoint as head of this fund, as a member of its board of directors, someone who owned a company that was doing business with this fund. That is when the problems began. For years, the people managing the fund were not both clients and distributors, so they were not in a perpetual conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651849">The former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains, a member of this Liberal government led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Papineau</Affiliation>, helped set the precedent that, unfortunately, went on for far too long. For the first time, the individual who was appointed president and CEO had a vested interest in this fund and was awarding herself contracts. Then, two more people were appointed. All in all, the Auditor General's investigation that I was talking about earlier found that this government had appointed nine directors to the board even though they were basically in a perpetual conflict of interest and their companies were receiving money from the fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651850">Based on this information alone, the government should have immediately hit the brakes and stopped everything. Appointees should be independent of the fund, but they should know how to administer a fund. I will return to that a little later, but it raises a fundamental issue. People are not appointed to a board of directors to simply show up for meetings, cash their paycheque and walk out. They must be diligent and well versed in company management, but not the type to seek benefits for their own company. Unfortunately, more than nine board members had conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651851">In June 2019, Liberal minister Navdeep Bains appointed someone with a conflict of interest to the position of president and CEO. Others followed. I would be remiss not to mention the company Cycle Capital, whose chair was appointed to SDTC. In this specific case, the Auditor General's investigation found that approximately $250 million was mixed up in conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651852">Through the Auditor General's investigation, we also learned that the current <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> was once a lobbyist for that company, which in and of itself is completely fine. I have absolutely no problem with people working as lobbyists, as long as they do it right. Today, this man is the Minister of Environment and Climate Change. We are talking about nearly $250 million here. That is quite a lot of money, especially since the current minister consulted for the government 47 times a lobbyist. That casts doubt on the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651853">Then, there was a change of governance at the department when Mr. Bains announced that he was stepping down. As is his prerogative, the Prime Minister shuffled his cabinet and appointed the member for <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation>, who, as we know, is an especially active guy for whom I have a lot of respect. Time will tell whether he makes any changes to his career. Let us say that a lot of people are watching him, myself included. This member became the minister responsible for the SDTC fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651854">The first alarm bells went off publicly in September 2023.

              <ParaText id="8651861">It was a whistle-blower who said these things in his testimony. This had a direct impact on why we are currently debating this question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651862">The first reports were made public and the whistle-blowers were there. In November 2023 the Auditor General launched an investigation. In June 2024, the report was tabled. It is a scathing report on the mismanagement of this fund. Over the five years that were reviewed by the Auditor General, which cover the partisan appointment of Navdeep Bains, a total of 82% of the contracts were illegitimately awarded. This is not some minor oversight, where a few things here and there fell through the cracks. No, it was 82% of the time. Things were done improperly four out of five times. It was either a conflict of interest, or people circumvented the rules of governance, or money was sent directly to the individual's own company. It does not work like that. This happened four out of five times, in 82% of the cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651863">Here is a breakdown of what we are talking about. Ten ineligible projects received $58,784,613. In 96 cases that added up to $259 million, conflict of interest policies were not followed. In 90 cases, conflict of interest policies were not followed, and there was no assurance that the terms and conditions of contribution agreements were respected. That is a total of $390,072,774. There are no cents in that total, and I have to say there is no sense in any of this. We are talking about $390 million, 82% of cases, mismanagement in four out of five projects, and conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651864">The report also makes the current minister look very bad. The Auditor General concluded that he did not engage in enough oversight over what was going on in the fund. The minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278162" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation>, keeps saying that he intervened as soon as he found out. I, a Conservative MP, am not the one saying that he did not do his job properly. The Auditor General is the one who found that he did not keep a close enough eye on what was going on. We are talking about $390 million. The sponsorship scandal was $42 million. That is a snapshot of the report's harsh condemnation of how poorly the fund was managed to the benefit of Liberal government cronies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651865">The Auditor General's investigation focused on management, not on potential criminal activity. As I referenced earlier, the whistle-blower was very clear during the meeting with the Auditor General. The Auditor General's job is to investigate management. It is up to the RCMP to determine whether criminal activities were involved. These are two completely different things. The whistle-blower was very clear that if the RCMP poked around a little, they would uncover criminal situations. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651866">On June 10, the House adopted a motion so that documents could be sent to the RCMP. That is what we asked for and, unfortunately, that did not happen. Accordingly, when the House resumed its work, an order of the House was issued by the Chair requiring the government to produce the documents. That is what we want and that is why we need to get to the bottom of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651867">A fund to protect the environment worked for 15-or-so years without any problem. When a new government arrived under the partisan auspices of the Liberal Party, things went off the rails. Four out of five projects were not processed correctly. What is more, $390 million of taxpayers' money was mismanaged. What is the result? The big losers are the companies that were counting on this money to do their work and truly serve this country by making investments in sustainable development technologies, as the name of this fund suggests. Ill-intentioned people across the way made sure this went completely off the rails. The first victims are the companies that want to invest in sustainable development technologies, in the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651868">In that regard, I would like to remind the House that, unlike what the Liberals have been saying ad nauseam, we, the Conservatives, are determined to tackle the challenges of climate change, which we recognize is real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651869">Just over a year ago, at the much-talked-about Conservative national convention in Quebec City, our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, the member for Carleton, gave an important speech that is going to go down in Canadian history. In what we call the Quebec City speech, the member for Carleton described our vision for the environment, while recognizing that climate change is real and that we need to adapt to the effects of climate change. The ultimate objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. This government believes that it can achieve that objective by imposing taxes. We will achieve that objective by taking direct and meaningful action to reduce pollution and create a better environment. That is the Conservative approach. It has four pillars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651870">The first pillar involves tax incentives for new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Companies emit greenhouse gases. They know why they are doing that, how they are doing it and how to reduce those emissions. The government will give them tax incentives to invest where they need to and where the problem is so that they can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651871">The second pillar is giving a green light to green energy. Now more than ever, Canada needs wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, nuclear and solar power. We need to give these projects the green light, not put the brakes on them, which is exactly what Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C‑69</Document> does by requiring hydroelectric projects to undergo two environmental assessments. With us, it will be one project, one assessment. We need to speed up the process of implementing green energies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651872">The third pillar is the Canadian advantage. In Canada, we have all kinds of energy and all kinds of natural resources. To tackle climate change, we need to develop our Canadian potential. As long as we need fossil fuels, we will fight for Canadian fossil fuels. Some spout the fantasy that Canada will no longer produce oil; however, that will not reduce consumption, it will simply transfer production. Therefore, the big winner, if by some misfortune we stop producing oil in Canada, will not be Canada or the environment, it will be Qatar and Saudi Arabia.</ParaText>

We are calling on the government to do the right thing, which is to comply with the House's order. Then we can find out what really went on. I began my remarks by talking about the $42-million sponsorship scandal. I would remind the House that we are now talking about a $390-million scandal. Speaking of the sponsorship scandal, we are still waiting for the Liberal Party to reimburse its dirty money.</ParaText>

Many of the people who were appointed to the arm's-length board, in my opinion, should have thought it was a privilege, but the culture they are part of and that they have enjoyed in order to be able to line their pockets has to start somewhere.

              <ParaText id="8651905">Time after time, we have seen the Liberal government fleecing taxpayers so it can enrich itself and its friends. It seems the only people in this country benefiting from the government's radical policies are Liberal insiders, who get to abuse Canadian taxpayer dollars without any oversight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651906">Every time we bring up the scandalous actions of these Liberal insiders, the government resists any attempts at holding them accountable or enacting any sort of consequences against them. Additionally, there is no initiative undertaken by the Liberal government to try to make up for these failures. There is no attempt to recoup the money these corrupt board members at SDTC funnelled to their own companies. In fact, all of the government's effort has been put into blocking Canadians from knowing the truth. It appears as though the whole purpose of SDTC was to just get as much money as possible out the door and into the businesses of well-connected Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651907">Yesterday, we saw the disdain these Liberal insiders hold for Canadians. When Conservatives have the audacity to hold them accountable and demand answers, they completely lose it. Yesterday at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the lawyer for Andrée-Lise Méthot, who is the founder and managing partner of Cycle Capital Management, actually began yelling at a Conservative member who was asking questions of his client. He seemed to think that to question her actions was unacceptable, despite her involvement in directing millions of dollars to businesses she had a vested interest in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651908">In fact, the meeting had to be suspended due to the disgusting behaviour and utter disrespect the lawyer showed to the committee. Even after being admonished by the chair during the suspension, he continued, if members can believe it, to make faces and wave his hands at another Conservative member while that member was asking questions. It is unsurprising that this is what it has come to with Liberal insiders treating parliamentary committees with such disdain when the government itself treats the House the exact same way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651909">What should Canadians think when they see these Liberal insiders can treat Parliament in such a way and still face no consequences from the corrupt government? It is obvious that Liberals and their friends believe that they supersede Parliament, that their abuse of taxpayers' dollars should not be questioned and that their actions are above reproach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651910">In fact, I am sure these Liberal insiders are confident in their actions because they used to employ the current radical Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, who was their lobbyist before becoming a Liberal MP and now minister. In fact, it came out through the course of this scandal that the environment minister still holds shares in a company that had special insider access to direct funding to businesses that it was invested in, a company that more than tripled in value since its co-founder was appointed to the SDTC board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651911">I suppose we should not be surprised that these connections have come to light, as it seems every other week a minister is connected to some scandal. This very <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is under scrutiny right now for his abject failure in his own department to manage the grants and contributions program at ECCC. Since 2018, over $4 billion has been given to Environment Canada for its grants and contributions funding. Now the department has failed an audit. The auditors found that there was a lack of documentation, a lack of oversight and an inability to show value for money or that what was paid for was actually received. Does that sound familiar? There was a lack of oversight of and a lack of value for money for over $4 billion, and in some instances, there was an inability to show that what was paid for was actually received. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651912">This has become the common practice of the Liberal government. A lack of documentation, a lack of oversight and an inability to show value for money or that what was paid for was actually received have become synonymous with Liberal corruption. Suffice it to say that the department performed so poorly, the auditors warned that the management of funds was so sloppy that it represented “potential legal and reputational damage”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651913">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> is happy to let the potential abuse of hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars within his department go unaddressed with no consequences. This is the sort of behaviour that is permissible by the government, by the cabinet. When his friends and former employees appear before committee, it is obvious that they feel they are entitled to treat Parliament with contempt. They know that their minister friend will do all that he can to stop Conservatives from holding them to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651914">The attempted cover-up of the SDTC scandal, the refusal to hand over unredacted documents to the House and the insistence by the government that it should dictate to the House what information it can receive are indicative of the arrogance it governs with. Canadians are tired of this holier-than-thou attitude. They are tired of the Liberal corruption and are tired of the cover-ups. They are calling on the government to be transparent and to come clean about what it let happen at SDTC. Canadians are paying attention and want the documents to be turned over unredacted. As the Speaker has ruled, the government must do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651915">Instead, the Liberals are desperately trying to cover up their corruption. Perhaps we will see them take this Speaker to court, just as they did with the last Speaker. However, if they really want to avoid turning over these documents, they could just call an election and see what Canadians think, but I digress.</ParaText>

Canadians are outraged that at a time when two million people are using food banks every month and a time when people are struggling to afford housing, the government is letting its Liberal insider friends gorge themselves on taxpayer dollars. It allows them to enrich themselves on the back of Canadians, and then it shields the insiders from any consequences.</ParaText>

We have heard that, but the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would like everyone to just move on and to stop looking into the issue because he has moved the program under the responsibility of the National Research Council, which means there is nothing more to see here and there is nothing to be done.</ParaText>

In fact, the minister does not even want an investigation to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651942">We would think that one of the first steps one would take in response to hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money being abused in this way would be for the RCMP to investigate what took place and assess whether a crime has been committed.

In each case, we saw a similar reaction from the government. First, its members denied that there were any issues. Then, they tried to block any investigation from happening. Then, they refused to comply with the investigations by not turning over documents. When we finally got some answers and revealed their corruption, they wanted to move past it, chalk it up to lessons learned and move on.

We can then get to the bottom of this issue so that Parliament can move on to other work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651979">I will have a few examples of this as I go through my presentation, but I would be remiss if I did not congratulate Premier Scott Moe and the Saskatchewan Party for once again returning a common-sense government to Saskatchewan. This is the fifth term for the Saskatchewan Party under premiers Wall and Moe. This has been done only two other times. It was done when Saskatchewan was first formed and had a Liberal premier for six terms and, when there used to be an NDP that stood for something, Tommy Douglas won five terms in Saskatchewan. Premier Moe and Premier Wall have tied Tommy Douglas in how many terms they have won consecutively. It is a great thing for my province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651980">I know lots of people put their names forward, and I will congratulate everyone who put their name on a lawn sign or a ballot. It is never an easy thing to do. There were candidates for the NDP, the Saskatchewan Party, the Sask United Party and the Buffalo Party. I congratulate everyone who put their name forward to take part in the election process. Some lose the election, but they always gain some experience and learn a few things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651981">Some friends of mine sought re-election. I want to congratulate Ken Cheveldayoff, who won in Saskatoon, and Blaine McLeod, who won in Lumsden-Morse. He is a great MLA as well. Lots of people have been returned to the legislature for the Saskatchewan Party, and I once again congratulate Premier Moe and his team for delivering a fifth term for the Saskatchewan Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651982">We talk about scandals here, but in Saskatchewan, in 1982, Grant Devine ran against Allan Blakeney. History tends to repeat itself. There is a wonderful quote from Grant Devine when they were debating that sounds similar to the answers we sometimes get from some of the Liberal ministers. They were debating, and Allan Blakeney kept saying how great the government had it and how everything was going well for the government. There is one line in one particular debate when Grant Devine said that, if the province was so well off, why did they not have more money in their pockets? That is an interesting comment. Do members not feel that is happening right now in Canada? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651983">The NDP-Liberals continue to say that Canadians have never had it so good, that Canadians are doing so well and that we have all these wonderful programs that they are paying for, which boggles my mind. The government does not pay for anything. The government does not have any money unless it takes it through taxes from businesses or people's paycheques. Therefore, it is not paying for anything. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8651984">Canadians, through their tax dollars, are paying for all the programs the NDP and the Liberals are foisting upon the people. They do not have a choice to pay their taxes, but when it comes to tax dollars, I say that a dollar in the pocket of the person who earned it is always better spent by them than by a government. That is something I will always believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651985">I want to talk about the SDTC motion, some of the things that have gone on and where the money has gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651986">Whenever we scratch the surface of Liberal-NDP spending, it seems like there is always a connection to, perhaps, a minister, like the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. There are a lot of other examples, including the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation>, whose spouse got quite a few grants from a few economic development funds. It is weird how there is always a familial connection to the people who are receiving grants from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651987">There have been a couple of other scandals over the last nine long years. We all remember the Aga Khan vacation scandal, the prison needle exchange program and the pressure put on the former justice minister to get Liberal donor SNC-Lavalin off the hook, with her being fired for not helping. I think we all remember Jody Wilson-Raybould and that she stood up for what was right, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> threw her right under the bus. We also remember Jane Philpott, who stood side by side with Jody Wilson-Raybould. She was also thrown under the bus by the feminist Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651988">We also remember the WE Charity scandal, which is interesting because it caused the 2021 election. There was a prorogation too, which may be a bit of foreshadowing for the current scandal. With the WE Charity, the Liberals were once again caught giving money to well-connected friends. I think they used some of that money to help the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family with some travelling and a couple of grants to some brothers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651989">To get themselves out of that situation so that the House of Commons and committee could not dig deeper, there was a prorogation. Then what happened after the prorogation? The 2021 election was called. Around how many millions was that? It was about $600 million. The current scandal is only $380 million, so not quite as expensive as the WE Charity scandal, but the Liberals prorogued and called an election. Let us hope they follow that pattern, because I think Canadians are ready for a carbon tax election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651990">The list is so long that I might have lost my spot. Another scandal was giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in ventilator contracts to Liberal Party insider Frank Baylis. I think Frank got $25 million for that contract, which is interesting because he never even produced ventilators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651991">That leads me to another point about the SDTC scandal and the way Liberals spend money. During COVID, over $600 billion was spent, but $300 billion of that was not spent on any of the COVID programs. We would love to know at some point in time where the other $300 billion went that was supposed to help Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651992">Here is another great line by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Do members remember when he went on TV for a big, national press conference and said that the government will go into debt so Canadians do not have to? Does everyone remember that line? I wonder if the Prime Minister understands how government debt gets repaid.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Warren Steinley:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have to do it by taking more tax dollars from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651995">One of my Liberal friends said, “Tell us.” In an earlier part of my speech, which I will repeat, I said the government does not actually have any money; it only has the money it takes from Canadians. The government has never made a dollar ever, so if it is going to pay back debt, it has to take more money away from Canadians, which will not allow them to fill their cars with gas, take their kids to hockey or put groceries on the table to feed their families. That is what we are talking about. The Prime Minister can go on national TV and say the government will take on debt so Canadians will not have to, but that is an absolute fallacy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8651996">There are a few more scandals I can get through before my time is done. I remember the next one very well, because we were here on the floor of the House, which was illegally invoking the Emergencies Act in February 2022. This is another scandal that will continue to grow as we get further down the road. There was a commission, and it was ruled that the government of the day, and I think it was a former public safety minister who did it, invoked the Emergencies Act illegally in order to take the rights and everyday freedoms away from Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651997"> I know my Liberal colleagues do enjoy a speech, and they are going to hear more and more about some of the scandals they have been involved with throughout the years. I know the backbenchers are feeling their oats, because they had another caucus meeting. I hope a few of them threw their names on another list. Perhaps they will be on the speaking list tomorrow morning and can share some of the wisdom that they have gained over the years with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I do not know if Katie allows them to speak or how that works, but hopefully members sent their emails so they can get on the speaking list in their caucus meeting tomorrow. To be a fly on that wall; that would be an interesting meeting to be part of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651998">I hope no one's hand is too sore from writing their name so many times on a piece of paper asking for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to resign. To be fair, we do understand how that works. We are hoping those members do get a few more signatures on that paper over the next few weeks. I think members would really appreciate that. Canadians would appreciate these members standing up for them and making sure the government knows how Canadians feel about the current leader. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8651999">I just saw some approval ratings for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, actually. In Saskatchewan, he is running at an approval rating of -51%. That is tough. Winter is actually ahead of him right now. It is pretty hard to be that unpopular in Saskatchewan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652000">I would like to get back to the issues at hand, especially when it comes to SDTC and the privilege motion. I for sure can bring it back to another Liberal scandal, such as the scandal of 380 million taxpayers' dollars that were given to Liberal insiders and the fact that the Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest in the grants that were delivered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652001">I believe the board members were all appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. The fact that board members were voting in a board meeting to give their own companies taxpayers' dollars is really the central issue. The fact is these people, who were put on the board by the Prime Minister, voted in a board meeting to give themselves money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652002">The Auditor General found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on occasion could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology. There was $334 million over 186 cases given to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. We have said that a few times. As well, $58 million was given to projects without ensuring contribution terms were met. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652003">How, when there is a board, do its members not realize that $58 million was given out and there were no performance metrics? Board members had no idea if these projects were actually going to do what they were supposed to do. I know this is uncomfortable for some of our colleagues across the way. This is going to be like the Paul Martin-Chrétien ad scam. We all know there have been comparisons, but the whistle-blower said that ad scam would pale in comparison to how corrupt this is. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652005">As a young lad, when I was at the University of Regina, I took Canadian politics. I graduated with a political science degree. I wrote a paper called “Have the Liberals Lost Legitimacy to Govern?” It was about the Afghan issue, but there are so many similarities to this. I know some members across the way will remember the name Jack Wiebe. He was my neighbour back where I grew up, in Rush Lake. Jack was a Liberal MLA. He was then a lieutenant-governor in Saskatchewan for 10 years and then he was appointed as a Liberal senator. He had a lot of connections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652006">When I interviewed Jack for my paper, he said yes, the Liberals had lost legitimacy to govern, because they had lost the trust of the Canadian public. It is amazing how history repeats itself if we do not learn from it. That is exactly what is happening to the current iteration of the Liberal Party. It is a far cry from Jack's party, I will admit, and from the Chrétien and Martin days, but the Liberals have repeated the same mistakes over and over again. They have become out of touch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652007">The current group of NDP-Liberals think the Canadian people are there for them to govern and should be working for them, instead of the other way around. That is when they start to think it is okay to give $8 million to Frank Baylis, who did not even create ventilators; it is okay for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to have $80,000 vacations given to him; it is okay for the Governor General to waste $100,000 by throwing private jet parties; and it is okay to decriminalize hard drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652008">We have not gotten to some of the scandals. I am very thankful the people who work in my office could make a complete list of Liberal scandals. I might hand it over to some of my colleagues. My staff got up to 68 scandals the Liberals have been a part of over the last nine years. Not only have the Liberals have been a part of 68 scandals, but the New Democrats continue to prop up the most corrupt government in the history of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652009">I am from Saskatchewan and the NDP has a long history there. Can members imagine propping up the most corrupt government in the history of Canada just because the leader wants his pension? It is unbelievable. We all know we are going to be here past February 2025 because that is when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>'s pension is vested. We know the NDP will not find the constitutional fortitude to vote the Liberals down at least until that is vested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652010">How do the New Democrats go back to the people they represent and say, day after day, they support a government that wasted $380 million of taxpayers' money? They support a government that took away the rights and freedoms of Canadians because they wanted to have a conversation with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They support a government that froze the bank accounts of Canadians who bought a T-shirt from people who were coming to have their voice heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652011">The senior Trudeau, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, did the same thing and invoked the emergencies act, but the NDP was different then. Tommy Douglas said invoking the act was like “using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut.” He actually stood up for the rights and freedoms of Canadians, which were hard-fought. The current iteration of the NDP will bend over backward to make sure the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> gets his pension. The New Democrats have completely forgotten they are here to represent the people of Canada and not to prop up a corrupt government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652012">I wish I had a bit more time; maybe I will on another day. I know my colleagues immensely enjoyed hearing about some of the scandals, and I did not even get halfway through that list of 68. Well, maybe there are a few more I can get through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652013">This is interesting: sunlight is the best disinfectant, a transparent government. The Liberals have pushed through more than 72 secret orders in council. Here is another good one. The <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> should listen to this one.

              <ParaText id="8652041">Mr. Speaker, today, my office released a documentary about the addiction crisis. People who are interested in this issue can go to eliteaddiction.ca to find out more about that documentary. In it, we talk specifically about the role of two companies, Purdue Pharma and McKinsey. This is a follow-up to a question I asked earlier about McKinsey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652042">Here is the story. Purdue Pharma developed a new opioid product, which they overpromoted with false information. This basically caused the opioid crisis. They told people that there was minimal risk of addiction and that, if they had any kind of issue with physical pain, they could take this drug without worrying about addictions. That, of course, was not true. Many people became addicted. They developed an escalating tolerance and physical demand for this drug. That led them to seek higher and higher doses of it and, eventually, to go to street drugs. This is the story of the opioid addiction crisis, in which many people were prescribed dangerous opioids that were overmarketed and overpromoted by Purdue Pharma. These people thought there would not be an addiction risk associated with it. They became addicted. They eventually switched to street drugs, and their lives were destroyed as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652043">Along the way, when Purdue Pharma started to face criticism about this, it went to a company called McKinsey, a global consulting firm. McKinsey provided advice to Purdue on how to supercharge sales of their opioids in the midst of these criticisms. Effectively, it was trying to supercharge the addiction crisis, which had already destroyed many lives and many families at that point. It would go on to continue to destroy many lives, families and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652044">This is a great blight on our society that I think must rightly be laid at the feet of these companies, Purdue Pharma and McKinsey. In the United States, these companies have been compelled to pay massive amounts of compensation, which has been redirected towards treatment and recovery. However, here in Canada, rather than holding companies such as Purdue and McKinsey to account, the Liberal government has continued to pay them and to pursue policies that have provided great financial advantage for them. In the case of Purdue Pharma, it has pursued a safe supply program; this leads to Purdue Pharma being paid to produce more dangerous drugs, which are then provided to those who are struggling with addiction at taxpayer expense. In the case of McKinsey, the government has hired McKinsey directly to provide advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652045"> Conservatives have said that we will sue those responsible for the opioid crisis for all the damages and redirect those funds to treatment and recovery. We would make the drug pushers pay, but the Liberals continue to pay the pushers. This is why we feel it is essential to challenge the government's close relationship with and massive spending on McKinsey. It is a choice to go to a company that is one of the actors responsible for the opioid crisis and ask it for advice on a whole range of issues to do with how to run the country. Why would we be paying McKinsey to provide advice instead of holding it to account for what it has done?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652046">I specifically want to ask the government this: What is behind this close relationship with McKinsey? Will it stop paying the pushers and instead support our policy to make the pushers pay?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8652047"> Mr. Speaker, the government indeed takes its responsibility as the steward of public funds very seriously. We are committed to making sure that government spending stands up to the highest levels of scrutiny. We have said many times already that we welcome and accept the findings and recommendations of the Auditor General and others with regard to their most recent report on procurement and professional services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652048">The findings are very much in line with several previous internal and external reviews relating to similar matters. These reviews are the basis for the work we have been doing for months now to implement stronger measures to improve oversight and controls of federal procurement. Our government is committed to taking action against bad actors, whether they be federal contractors, anti-abortion activists or homophobic hecklers. I am sure the member across the way agrees with me on the importance of all three. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652049">Public Services and Procurement Canada, PSPC, is the federal government's central purchasing agent and is committed to conducting procurements in an open, fair and transparent manner. Of course, the Government of Canada already has solid regulations, procedures and guidelines in place to make sure that anything that happens in every department is maintained appropriately, but we are always looking for ways to continuously improve our processes, to make them more rigorous and to ensure that decisions and justifications are properly documented along the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652050">To that end, PSPC has already instituted several changes. These include introducing a mandatory requirement for contracting authorities to retain all documents related to contractual decisions about professional services. We have also changed how the department administers non-competitive national master standing offers by ensuring that justifications are on file. In addition, PSPC has created a new position: chief of contract quality assurance and records compliance. This will also help to ensure that critical elements of decision-making throughout the procurement process are properly documented, that guidelines and tools are put in place and that quality is being actively monitored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652051">These efforts are consistent with PSPC's commitment to continuously improve government procurement practices. I can tell the House that officials will keep looking for ways to strengthen the integrity of government procurement. For example, regarding the Auditor General's June 2024 report, we accept her recommendations to further strengthen measures to appropriately report and monitor potential conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652052">The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat now has a new mandatory procedure that provides the additional checks and balances for managers, to reinforce their responsibilities and accountabilities when undertaking professional services and procurement activities. Indeed, it is important to have proactive and rigorous processes in place to identify conflicts of interest and procurement processes. PSPC is supporting the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat in the implementation of this new mandatory procedure to ensure that standards across all agencies are met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652053">I want to thank the Auditor General and her team for undertaking the review and for their findings and valuable recommendations. They will help us continue to improve our processes and further strengthen the integrity of federal procurement of professional services. Our government will do all that is possible to ensure that the best value for Canadian taxpayers and government procurement is maintained throughout the wide degree of procurement that occurs in the Government of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652055">Here is my core question: Why McKinsey? I have detailed the history of McKinsey and its involvement in the opioid crisis. We could talk about how it helped the Saudi government identify dissidents. We could talk about its support for Chinese state-run and state-affiliated companies, including those involved in military and quasi-military activity. We could talk about contracts it had or some of the work it did in Russia. The record of McKinsey is well known, especially as it relates to its support for Purdue Pharma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652056"> If we look back at the $200 million in contracts from the government, many of which did not meet the rules, it speaks to the fact that the government went out of its way to want to help the people at McKinsey. Why? What did it see in McKinsey? Why was it so keen to send taxpayer dollars to McKinsey?</ParaText>

It is not the largest, by far; it is actually one of the smallest ones. Notwithstanding, we are committed to finding the best value for money in all aspects of procurement, and we have to make sure that we have a proper governing framework in place that we have applied to these very issues. We are always looking at ways to improve procurement processes, as we always do. I appreciate the members opposite for their concern as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652059"> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour tonight to stand and to be able to see whether I can get some further clarification around a question I recently asked in order to be able to provide some clarification for federal workers across the country. I recently stood to speak to whether the government will be repealing the “one size fits none”, which is what it is being called, return-to-office mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652060">We know that the arbitrary mandate to return to the office three days a week blindsided federal workers. Superficially, it does not sound like a problem. Why would it be a lot to ask to ask people to go back to work three days a week? I need to really clarify what the issues are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652061">The issue is that it happened without due consultation with the exact people who are impacted by the decision. Workers across Canada were being told that they needed to return to work now three days a week, and there was not a bigger plan put in place. There was not a bigger discussion on how this would impact the workers we rely on to provide essential services across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652062">I have heard from hundreds of concerned workers across the country in my riding of Nanaimo—Ladysmith, there are so many who are impacted by the decision. One example I want to bring to the attention of the House is that of a worker in my riding who came up to me to talk about his experience since the mandate was put in place. He shared with me that he was hired with flexible work arrangements, his productivity was great and he was doing important work for our country, but the return-to-work mandate has now placed him in a position where he needs to share a cubicle with other workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652063"> The workers are rotating through the cubicle. He has to put his items into a locker at the end of the day. He has to go to a designated room in order to make phone calls. Of course, he is making phone calls all day long. His productivity has decreased. His morale has decreased in his work. It is just so inefficient to ask a worker to go back to work and to sit in a seat when there is not even a seat there for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652064">That is not the only issue I am hearing about from workers across Canada. Others were hired under the agreement that they would have flexible work arrangements. If we truly want to have representation in our federal workplaces, we need to be having these conversations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652065">For example, people have talked to me about an indigenous woman who lives in a rural community. She has been doing great work in what she is doing, but now she has been told she has to return to work. However, it is not possible for her to return to the office because the travel takes too long. She was hired under the assumption that she would be working in a hybrid model, and she is now being told that that this is no longer the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652066">Parents and parents-to-be were told that they would have flexible work arrangements, and now, with no notice, they are being told they have to return to work. We all know how long the child care lists are across Canada. It is unfair to ask parents to suddenly change their entire working conditions to accommodate child care when there is no child care available to them because they were not given the notice needed to make those arrangements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652067">Employee morale is low. We know that it has just been so disheartening for people who are working in positions with flexible arrangements to feel as if they are being monitored on a daily basis. It is just incredibly challenging for workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652068">My question to which I wanted to hear the answer from the government when I previously rose in the House is this: Will the government be repealing the decision, working alongside federal employees to make sure that there are arrangements to keep people in vital roles?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652069">Mr. Speaker, our public service is composed of hard-working Canadians from across the country who are committed to providing the highest level of service to Canadians. Dedicated federal public servants serve Canadians day in and day out, from coast to coast to coast. The services they provide have a real and meaningful impact on Canadians every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652070">While it is important to understand that each department and agency is unique, the experience of working in the federal public service, or receiving its services, should be the same across the country. That is why the public service implemented an updated common hybrid work model in September. The decision to make changes to the directive on hybrid work was an administrative one. It was made by the Treasury Board Secretariat, working with the Privy Council; this was not a political decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652071">The updated model requires public servants to work on site for a minimum of three days a week when their tasks and functions allow. Executives are now required to be on site a minimum of four days a week so that they can best support their teams. To prepare for the implementation of the updated hybrid model, departments have been working closely with both PSPC and Shared Services Canada since May to ensure that there are enough well-equipped office spaces and technology for their employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652072">While most organizations were ready to welcome all their employees to the office at least three days a week in September, we knew that some would require additional time because of renovations or the addition of extra workspaces. In these situations, implementation timelines were adjusted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652073">Recognizing the importance of union engagement, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat held a series of meetings with bargaining agents to discuss issues, such as office space, technology and privacy. It is important to note that the direction on prescribed presence in the workplace and the directive on telework are distinct from each other; moreover, neither is a part of the collective agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652074">However, even with all this preparation, we expected and planned for challenges. This is the reality of any changes within an organization as large, diverse and distributed as the federal public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652075">As noted, contingency plans were established. Departments continue to carefully monitor implementation and to actively seek employee feedback to support the updated hybrid work model in their organizations. The clerks and department heads will continue to monitor implementation and optimization of this directive, ensuring fairness, flexibility and a focus on a high-performing public service that is delivering for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652077">There is clear evidence that, with flexible work arrangements for federal workers, we saw increased productivity. We are in a climate crisis. We saw a significant decrease in carbon emissions during the time that there were flexible work arrangements compared with when the same workers were working full time. Just here in Ottawa, this stat shows that emissions have been 25% lower. In addition, in terms of taxes, we know that more public funds will have to go into making these improvements to the buildings that we are hearing about. Currently, the infrastructure is not in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652078">Productivity was high and people were happy when working in a flexible work arrangement. Why is this not continuing to happen, and will the government repeal this decision? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652081">Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago, I asked a question about the steel industry. I talked about the brave steelworker who stood up to the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when he was trying to justify the alleged work the Liberals are doing for the steel industry. The Prime Minister had an encounter with this brave steelworker, who, as far as I am concerned, spoke truth to power, which is a rare thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652082"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was talking about how he is doing such great things by putting steel tariffs there, following the Conservatives, who called for steel tariffs, and he talked about some investment and said to the steelworker that $400 million is going to keep his job. The steelworker said, “What about the 40 per cent taxes I am paying? And I don’t have a doctor.” The Prime Minister said, “The $400 million invested means you are going to have a job.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652083">This is where the steelworker got very interesting. He said, “I think you're only here for another year. We won't see you around probably in another year, I'm guessing.” On this count, I think, this steelworker is where most Canadians are. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went on to try to convince him of the various things the government is doing that are so great. This is what the steelworker finished with. He said, “I don't believe you for a second.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652084"> I would agree with this brave steelworker who said that to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Now, why would he say that? For one thing, the carbon tax is going to kill the steel industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652085"> About six months ago, I met with the CEOs and the union representatives for steel manufacturing in Canada. All of them said very directly to me that if the carbon tax continues to go up, there will be no steel industry in Canada. This was not just the steel CEOs. Representatives of the United Steelworkers were there and they said the same thing: The carbon tax is going to kill the steel industry in Canada. We can talk about how terrible the carbon tax is for a whole bunch of things, but this is a concrete example where there was unanimity. The steelworkers said the carbon tax is going to kill the steel industry. All of the steel companies said the carbon tax is going to kill the steel industry. Despite this, the Liberals just keep beating the drum that somehow the carbon tax is good for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652086"> We have seen what the carbon tax has done to the price of food. We now have two million people going to food banks in Canada every month. If, when the Conservatives were in government, someone had said that in 10 years, every month two million Canadians would be going to food banks, we would have thought they were crazy. Little did we know how corrosive the carbon tax would be to the social fabric of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652087">Going back to the gist of my question, I got such a terrible answer from the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, saying the Liberals are always going to be there to stand up for steelworkers. Those words and $1.50 can get a double-double at Tim Hortons. Well, no, it would have gotten one before the Liberals took power; now it is more like $2.50. The point is that they are hollow, empty words that fly in the face of what the steel industry is very clearly and directly saying: that the carbon tax will lead to the death of the steel industry in Canada if the Liberals go ahead with their plan to quadruple the carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652088">In the face of that overwhelming evidence, how can the Liberals justify quadrupling the carbon tax, to steelworkers in this country? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652089"> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be here for this adjournment debate. I would like to thank my colleague and neighbour from Dufferin—Caledon for entertaining the opportunity for it this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652090">I printed off an article for my friend, and I hope he chooses to read it. As I was telling him just a couple of minutes ago, I feel as though the art of thoughtful debate and real conversation in the House has suffered at the hands of the three-word slogan. I like the opportunity to talk about some of our measures to lower carbon emissions in Canada and help the steel industry and lots of other industries usher in a more sustainable future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652091">Before I go on, I would like to say that not only am I a big fan of Canada's steel industry, but I used to be a steelworker. I worked at Aldershot steel when I was in university. I came from a working-class family and grew up in community housing, so a $20-an-hour job was really exciting for me when I was 19 or 20 years old. Kayaks, incidentally, are made out of carbon fibre and are expensive, so I needed a job and Aldershot steel was close to school. After my classes were done at McMaster University, I would often put in a few hours at the shop, so I know a lot of steelworkers. McMaster is in Steeltown too, which is Hamilton. I will give a shout-out to the Hamilton Ticats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652092">While the member was speaking, I looked up some of the initiatives the Canadian Steel Producers Association has undertaken. It is very committed to sustainable steel. In fact, ArcelorMittal Dofasco earned responsible steel certification, which recognizes the company's leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, noise emissions and effluents, as well as waste and waste-water stewardship and biodiversity. Canada's steel producers are leading the way. They are moving toward new electric arc reactors, which do not rely on coal to heat up iron ore and metals in order to make steel and steel products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652093">I looked at the ambitions of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, and I will read a couple of them:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652097">The CSPA recognizes the value in low-carbon steel. It wants to be a world leader in low-carbon steel and does not want to do things the way they were done 150 years ago during the Industrial Revolution, when it seemed natural to burn coal to create heat to produce steel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652098">It is 2024 and will be 2025 soon. It is important that we get with the times. It is critical that we encourage and support industry as it moves past high carbon-intensity production. Having an industrial carbon price and a consumer carbon price is the reason our emissions are 30% lower than they were under Stephen Harper's government. In fact, the last time they were this low, Kurt Cobain was still alive and I was 12 years old and listening to Nirvana.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652099">It has been a really long time since Canada had a downward trajectory on emissions, and that is something to celebrate, particularly because interest rates are going down, inflation is going down and job numbers are getting even better. Our economy is solid in Canada, and it is solid with industrial and consumer carbon pricing. Canadians, in 2019 and 2021, when I was at their doors, demanded climate action, and that is one of the things our government has delivered on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652100">Mr. Speaker, this is exhibit A of the problem. First of all, the member noted the use of electric arc to heat up and process iron ore. Electric arc cannot process iron ore. It only works with recycled steel. The member does not even know what he is talking about regarding the steel industry, which means the government probably does not know. That is problem number one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652101">Problem number two is that CEOs have converted some of their blast furnaces into electric arc and they still pay carbon taxes. They told me how much carbon tax the steel industry pays. It is a gigantic number. They said that as a result of that, if carbon pricing goes up, there will be no steel industry whether they convert to electric arc or not. I am trying to speak slowly and clearly so I can hopefully get an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652102">Everything the member just said is irrelevant to what the steel industry said. Whether they convert everything to electric arc or not, they are still paying carbon taxes on the other energy they use, and it will drive them out of business. There will be no steelworkers. Why will the Liberals not admit it and axe the carbon tax? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8652103">Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but highlight a little bit of the misinformation from the member. I was reading directly from the Steel Producers Association website. To suggest that it does not represent the views of the steel producers or the steel industry is straight up false. It is not fair to suggest that the Steel Producers Association does not have their best interests at heart, when I was reading directly from its website.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652104"> However, Canadians right across the country are concerned about climate change, and that includes people in the member's own riding. I have travelled around southwestern Ontario, I have friends in Shelburne and I am frequently in Orangeville. I know that the mayor of Caledon, Allan Thompson, has said that because of climate change, “Every year, we're seeing more storms, higher temperatures and changes to the flora and fauna around us.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8652105"> If we do not do something to fight climate change and lower our emissions, then we are really doing a huge disservice to future generations.</ParaText>
