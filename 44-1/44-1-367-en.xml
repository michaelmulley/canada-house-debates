One of the oldest congregations in Ontario, Toronto East began as a small group gathering in a modest worship hall on Danforth Avenue. As the church grew, it moved several times to larger spaces, but it always stayed within Toronto's east end and is currently in my riding of Scarborough North.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676476">Toronto East remains a beacon of faith, service and community, a fellowship filled with smiling faces, soulful music and spirited worship. I send my congratulations to pastors Selburn Fray and Nicholas Patrick and elders Enos Stewart and Jean Lazarus, as well as the wider congregation, on this century milestone. May Toronto East continue to inspire faith, love and hope for many more generations to come.</ParaText>

He caught my attention immediately with his keen interest in all matters of hunting, fishing, trapping and the outdoor way of life, and we became fast friends. It was not long before we were organizing the Conservative hunting and angling caucus, wild fish and game potluck meals, and fishing on the Ottawa River on June evenings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676479">Bob was a fighter. He vigorously defended hunting, farming, ranching and common-sense conservation. He pushed for the recreational fisheries conservation partnerships program, which has left a lasting legacy of fisheries enhancement across Canada. He fought for us, so much so that he was named 2017 International Legislator of the Year by Safari Club International, just one of his many accolades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676480">I will miss Bob. I will miss the daily text messages, phone calls, emails and words of encouragement. I am sad that the trips we had planned will be left unfinished, but I will revel in the memories of the ones we took.</ParaText>

I had the pleasure of participating in Yellow Brick House's 2024 Break the Silence, Step In My Shoes Walk. Together, we raised an incredible $77,000 to support women and children fleeing domestic violence. The vital funding will provide shelter and life-saving services to those in need. I give a special thank you to Lorris Herenda, the president and CEO of the organization. As we recognize November as Woman Abuse Prevention Month, I encourage everyone to continue supporting organizations such as Yellow Brick House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676484">On a different front, there was the retirement of a wonderful firefighter, Brad Humfryes. After decades of courageous service to our community, he has retired. His bravery and selfless commitment to our community has made a lasting mark. He and his wife, Sandra, have provided so much to our community in other ways. We wish him a well-deserved and fulfilling retirement.</ParaText>

The Food Cupboard has gone from being a helping hand to an absolute necessity for too many families in my riding. </ParaText>

However, the leader of the Conservative-Reform party has made the decision that it is not good for Canadians. How unfortunate that is. He is putting at risk about half a million homes, which is serious stuff, and the type of leadership we are getting from the Conservative right today. It is all about cuts. He does not care about what is happening in our communities. When housing is a concern, where are the Conservatives? They are cutting away, to the disservice of all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676747"> The Conservative Party of Canada values the role of temporary foreign workers in supporting our nation's agriculture and other essential industries. Through our contributions to the committee's study, Conservatives sought reforms that would secure predictability and access to labour for sectors struggling with chronic worker shortages. Unfortunately, the final report fell short, failing to include key recommendations that would benefit workers, businesses and the broader economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676748"> In our dissenting report, we emphasize that the temporary foreign worker program should continue to address specific labour gaps, supporting rural and agricultural communities where Canadian workers are unavailable, while resisting an open work permit model that would undermine this goal. Additionally, we strongly condemn the baseless comments made by the UN special rapporteur, who referred to the temporary foreign worker program's agricultural stream as a “breeding ground for...slavery”. These inflammatory statements ignore the facts and undermine the hard work and ethical standards of Canadian farmers and business owners who strive to provide safe, respectful workplaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676749"> The Conservative Party will continue to advocate for solutions that safeguard worker rights and secure Canada's food and economic security.</ParaText>

The last unprotected, intact old-growth valley on southern Vancouver Island is slated for logging.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676753"> This important petition received 1,695 signatures, the large majority from Newfoundland and Labrador, asking the government to, first, immediately revert the 2J3KL northern cod fishery to a stewardship fishery with access exclusive to Newfoundland and Labrador inshore and indigenous harvesters; second, reaffirm its commitment to allocate the first 115,000 tonnes of quota to those harvesters; and third, ensure large offshore draggers are not permitted to fish the stock until it has rebuilt to meet the 115,000-tonne threshold committed and to withstand the increased fishing pressures.</ParaText>

Second, it is impossible for clinicians to distinguish a rational MAID request from one motivated by suicidality. Accordingly, such an expansion, the petitioners note, would recklessly put some of the most vulnerable persons at risk. </ParaText>

They go on to note the lower voter turnout in Ontario's last election as a trend of reduced voter engagement. They note that voters who support all parties in all age demographics across the country support the principle of proportional representation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676761">The petitioners go on to name a particular solution, the national citizens' assembly, which would give citizens a role in building consensus on a specific model to improve our electoral system in Canada. They note that citizen assemblies have been used in jurisdictions around the world, including Australia, Belgium, France and a number of others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676762"> The petitioners have three calls to action for the government. They call on it to, first, establish a national citizens' assembly on electoral reform consisting of citizens reflecting the diversity of Canadian society; second, mandate that assembly to propose a specific design for an electoral system tailored to Canada's needs, which could make every vote count; and third, work across party lines to implement the changes before the next federal election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676765">Mr. Speaker, the first petition I am presenting today is on extreme intoxication as a legal defence. Amendments were made to the Criminal Code on June 23, 2022, allowing for “extreme intoxication as a defence for violent [crimes] like assault and sexual assault, even where a reasonable person would not have foreseen the risk of a violent loss of control.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676766">The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found rates of violence against indigenous women and girls to be alarmingly higher than for any other demographic in Canada. First nations communities are often in rural areas that are underserved by law enforcement, creating longer response times and a greater potential for violent acts of crime. Alcoholism and substance abuse are rapidly growing issues, leaving first nations more vulnerable to acts of violence. According to the First Nations Health Authority, first nations make up only 3.3% of British Columbia's population but a staggering 15% of toxic drug deaths. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676767">Therefore, the undersigned indigenous citizens of Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon call upon the federal government to remove their amendments to the Criminal Code related to extreme intoxication and uphold their commitment to protecting first nations women.</ParaText>

Health Canada recently proposed new and significant fees to import, manufacture and sell NHPs, along with new labelling laws. This means that consumer prices will rise and consumer choice will decline. Many Canadians rely on NHPs, which include basic, everyday products, such as toothpaste, vitamins, probiotics and fibre. Canada's current standards for natural health products already keep people safe.

They have added 80 signatures to the thousands of signatures we have seen coming in from across the country over the last few days.

              <ParaText id="8676787">Mr. Speaker, with respect to the question noted above, what follows is the response from the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676788">With regard to part (a), the TFSA contribution room was removed from the T1 notice of assessment, NOA, after 2011. At the time of this decision, the CRA was focused on enhancing the information available on My Account for individuals, found at https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html. The CRA aimed to make it a quality service for Canadians to obtain up-to-date details about their TFSA transactions and available contribution room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676789">As financial institutions are only required to file TFSA records by the end of February of the following year, and since information is subject to change due to late-filed or amended records, the TFSA contribution room on the T1 NOA could be outdated when the notice was issued or become outdated by the time an individual was ready to make a TFSA contribution. The CRA opted to encourage TFSA holders to refer to My Account to obtain their contribution room, as it is continuously updated as new or amended records are processed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676790">In all cases, it continues to be important for individuals to track transactions completed since January of the current year, as this information will not be reflected on My Account until the following year once it is reported by financial institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676791">With regard to part (b), taxpayers who cannot access their TFSA contribution room information online can either call or write to the CRA to request a paper copy of their TFSA room statement or TFSA transaction summary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676792">With regard to parts (c) and (d), while the CRA’s service feedback system is a case management system that allows the CRA to track complaints submitted by Canadians for specific programs, it does not detail complaints that are specifically associated with the removal of the TFSA contribution room from the NOA. Therefore, it is not possible for the CRA to provide a breakdown by province, by federal riding boundaries or by communication medium to resolve complaints as information for the removal of TFSA contribution room from the NOA is not captured. For these reasons, the CRA is unable to provide a response in the manner requested.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8676820"> Mr. Speaker, I have the honour of rising in Canada's Parliament to join in the debate about the privilege question relating to the Liberal government's latest scandal: the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676821">Before I do that, I just want to take a moment to mark this historic day and congratulate our neighbours to the south for a very decisive election. I congratulate Mr. Trump for regaining the White House. Canada and the U.S. have so many ties. They are not just economic, which is going to become very relevant for us, but also social and family ties. For me, it is my daughter, Kristi, her husband, Brad, and their four children, my grandchildren. They are all proud Americans living in the state of Washington.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676822">What are the future relations of Canada and the U.S. going to look like? We do not have to look any further than a speech that President Kennedy gave here when he was first elected in 1961. He said, “Geography has made us neighbours. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies.” That is as true today as it was 60 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676823">It is often said that the success of a Canadian prime minister depends largely on how well they get along with the U.S. president. Politics is about relationships, after all. How is that going to look in the next little while? We do not have to look very far. History tells us that we should probably be having an election very soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676824">This is now the fourth week we have been debating the Liberal government's refusal to produce documents relating to SDTC, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, also called the green slush fund lately. Parliament ordered the government and SDTC to produce documents in June.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676825">Why are the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his cabinet and his government refusing to deliver those documents? We do not know, but the longer they delay, the more suspicious we become. Are some of the cabinet ministers involved? Are they involved in the graft related to the green slush fund? I think that they need to come out and tell us what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676826">The Liberals have raised specious arguments about why they can ignore this order and why they do not have to comply with it. It is something about contravening the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What are the arguments? We do not know because they have not stated them very clearly. Besides, who are the Liberals to judge? They are one of the litigants in this whole litigation. They are not the judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676827">What the Liberals are conveniently ignoring is that the rights of Parliament are spelled out in our Constitution. We can look at sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but we can also look at the preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867, which says Canada shall have a Constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. That goes back 157 years in our history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676828"> Section 18 of the Constitution Act also defines parliamentary privilege for the House of Commons and all its members as those “enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain”. Those are the privileges as they existed the day that Canada became a nation on July 1, 1867.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676829">That latter point is very important because with that comes 650 years of parliamentary tradition and history coming out of the mother of all parliaments in Westminster. One of those traditions is, of course, the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. It is that Parliament can make or unmake any law that it deems just and appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676830">Another one of these age-old traditions is the concept of responsible government, where the government, the Prime Minister and his cabinet, must always retain the confidence of the House and must answer questions from the opposition during a daily question period relating to the business of government. A third way that the House of Commons keeps the government accountable is through motions directing the government to do certain things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676831">An early example of that, at least early in my career, was a Conservative opposition motion in December 2019, just a few months after I was elected, to create a special, all-party committee of parliamentarians on China-Canada relations. That motion passed with the support of the Bloc Québécois and the NDP members of Parliament. Only the Liberals voted against it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8676832"> Someone had pointed out at the time that this was the first time the Liberal government, under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, had lost a significant vote. Of course, four years earlier, the Liberals had been elected as a majority government, so they could put through any legislation that they wanted or stop any legislation or motions they did not like. This was a whole new dynamic now, a minority government, and the Liberals had not yet figured out how to play nice with the opposition parties for a minority government and a minority Parliament to be successful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676833">I want to point out the Liberals did comply with that motion and we created a special committee on Canada-China relations. However, things deteriorated pretty quickly after that. We have seen time and again where the Liberals, under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, have held Parliament in contempt. I am going to raise three examples of when that happened. Of course, just to anticipate the end of my speech, the third example is going to be the green slush fund, which is the subject of the day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676834">The first example was a pandemic power grab. I remember that day very well. It was March 13, 2020. The World Health Organization had called this virus a worldwide pandemic. The parties consulted and we agreed that we would suspend Parliament for five weeks, hoping that perhaps the worst of things would be over by then. Then the Liberals tried to pull a fast one on us. Just a couple of weeks later, they put forward a proposal that Parliament would be suspended for a long period of time and that they would be given all the power they wanted to tax and spend as they pleased without parliamentary oversight, which we found just unbelievable. Parliament has worked very effectively during other times of crisis, so what was so different this time? We put a quick stop to this insanity and the Liberals had to back down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676835"> The second example of the government holding Parliament in contempt was with the Winnipeg lab affair. The special committee on Canada-China relations, which we know the Liberals did not like very much, was investigating rumours that two employees of the Public Health Agency of Canada, PHAC, had been fired because of their direct ties to the Beijing Communist regime. The committee ordered the production of documents, similar to what we are doing with the green slush fund, and on June 2 Parliament voted to confirm that order. The Liberals voted no, of course. PHAC did not comply with this order. Therefore, on June 17, 2022, the House declared the agency to be in contempt of Parliament and ordered that the president appear in the House of Commons to be reprimanded in public and ordered to produce the documents. The Speaker of the day, Mr. Anthony Rota, supported the majority of the House, of course. He was doing his job—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676838"> Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278667" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation>, who is a former Speaker of the House. He supported us, of course. He was doing his job. That is what the Speaker is supposed to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676839">Now we know the Liberals did not like the special committee on China-Canada relations right from the start. We know that they did not like the makeup of the 43rd Parliament, a divided House, and we knew that they would not like this order for the production of documents because they wanted to keep all this ugly business that was going on in the Winnipeg labs and the relationship with the Wuhan lab in China under cover, but what we did not know was the degree of contempt that this Liberal Party held for Parliament. We found that out when the former Attorney General, the Liberal Attorney General, sued the former Speaker of the House, who was a member of the Liberal Party. There was a big showdown in court of the Attorney General's lawyers versus the Speaker's lawyers, all at the expense of taxpayers because we were paying for all the lawyers. We knew that this was a loser case right from the very start. We knew that no one was going to come out the winner, except for the lawyers maybe, who were charging their full hourly rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676840"> In the end, the whole case fizzled out when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made his trip to the Governor General's mansion and asked her to dissolve Parliament and to drop the writ for a new election. In the end, the 43rd Parliament lasted only a mere 23 months. We thought that the Prime Minister would do the responsible thing and wait until the pandemic was behind us, but, no, right in the middle of a pandemic, he thought that perhaps Canadians would affirm what he and the Liberals had been doing, and that they would return a majority government for the Liberals. We all know how that ended. The 44th Parliament, the one that we are in right now, looks very much like the 43rd Parliament. There was $600 million spent in expenses to run that election campaign and the House looks almost exactly as it did before with roughly the same number of Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Bloc Québécois. We lost some of our colleagues, we gained a few others; the same with the other parties. In the end, the Liberals, even though they lost the popular vote, had the most seats, so they got to form government. Conservatives were the official opposition while the Bloc Québécois and the NDP looked pretty much like they did before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676841">This brings me to the issue of the day, the green slush fund, which is the third example of the Liberal government holding Parliament in contempt. The scandal started with some whistle-blowers who worked at Sustainable Development Technology Canada who smelled a rat and called in the Auditor General. As a little bit of background, SDTC is a federally owned and created company with a mandate to promote public and private investment in green technology. That is a laudable goal, I would say. If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had just left things alone, SDTC today would still be functioning and fulfilling its mandate, but he could not resist putting his fingerprints all over that company. He fired the then board chair, Mr. Jim Balsillie, who was very capable at his job, but had some disagreements with the Prime Minister, so the Prime Minister put in all his own people, who were friends of the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676842">We know all of that from the Independent Auditor's Report, which was tabled with Parliament on June 4. I am not going to list everything from the report because many other speakers have already done so, but, for example, $390 million was misallocated to insiders, board members who the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had appointed. They had non-qualifying projects that did not even meet the criteria. As well, there were 186 instances of conflicts of interest as board directors had voted money for their own companies. “Hey, I'm going to step out of the room. Please vote for my application of a couple of million dollars and then I'll return the favour to you when it's your turn to step out.” It was just friends distributing taxpayer money amongst themselves. This is what one of the whistle-blowers said after the auditor's report came out:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.</QuotePara>

              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8676844">These are very serious words. This was not just mismanagement, but criminal activity, so the official opposition did what we are supposed to do, which is to hold the government to account. We put forward a motion for the production of documents. The NDP and the Bloc Québécois voted with us, doing their jobs. As fellow opposition members, it is also their job to hold the government to account. That motion passed on June 10, six days after the Auditor General's report came out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676845">The Liberals, of course, were not happy that the motion passed, but this is the reality of a minority House, where they need to get the support of at least one of the other parties to get their way. They failed. They did not do that. The order was made. Parliament is supreme. Parliament has the authority to do this. It is definitely within our jurisdiction to do so, but the Liberals just refused. They think that they have some arguments to say that they do not have to comply with the order, and they did not. They ignored it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676846">As such, we came back here to Ottawa, to Parliament, in September, and things got ugly. We appealed to the Speaker and asked him to rule on the question of privilege. We argued, based on the age-old rules, that Parliament has the right to and the privilege of demanding the production of documents when it sees fit to do so. The Speaker ruled in our favour. I will read one sentence from the Speaker's ruling: “The Chair cannot come to any other conclusion but to find that a prima facie question of privilege has been established.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676847">One would think that that would be the end of the story. It was pretty clear, but we know what these Liberals think about Speakers who make rulings that they disagree with. They sue them, hoping maybe to find a judge who would turn a blind eye to the centuries-old traditions of parliamentary proceedings and parliamentary privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676848">The Liberals did it before. Will they do it again, or will they just keep dodging and weaving as they have for the last four weeks, or actually since June, saying that nothing gets done around here? It is because of this contemptuous behaviour on the part of the Liberal government that things have ground to a halt here in Canada's Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676849">We know the Liberals do not like an aggressive opposition. I get it. They think that we should all play nice. “Hey, we are all in this together”, they like to say, but we are just doing our job as the official opposition, holding this government to account as prescribed by Canada's Constitution. Now the Liberals need to do their job and comply with the order so that we can all get back to work. That is what we want to do. We have important work to do here, but the Liberals' refusal to act is causing us to have ground to a halt here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676850"> Now, the Liberals have not formally lost the confidence of the House because the New Democrats, despite all their bluff and blunder, continue to support this corrupt and incompetent regime, but the Liberals have lost the confidence of the people of Canada. I know that. This is what my colleagues and I are hearing at home, in our ridings, when we are out knocking on doors and when we are at events in our communities. It is what we heard in the two recent by-elections, where the Liberals' base supporters are even saying, “Enough is enough. It is time for a change”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676851">Here is an idea for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>: Do not comply with the order about the green slush fund. Do not even bother taking the Speaker to court. The Liberals would lose. He should take a walk to the Governor General's mansion and ask her to dissolve the 44th Parliament and call an election because that is what Canadians want. They are ready for a government that would stop the corruption, fix what the Liberals have broken and offer common-sense solutions to the problems facing ordinary Canadians, the people whom we listen to. Canadians deserve a government that would axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676852">Canadians deserve a government that does not play favourites, but creates an environment where non-insiders can work hard and get ahead. Canadians deserve a Canada that delivers on its promise to all who call it home, which is that hard work earns a powerful paycheque for pensioners and for workers that buys an affordable home on a safe street in a country where everyone from anywhere can do anything, as long as they work hard. All of this is achievable, but first we need an election. There needs to be a call for a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676854">I refer the member to a story in The Hill Times. The author of the story is Steven Chaplin, a former senior legal counsel in the office of the House law clerk and parliamentary counsel. He is an expert, and he gives a very stark warning to all members of the House because of this game the official opposition is playing. He wrote, “It is time for the House to admit its overreach before the matter inevitably finds its way to the courts which do have the ability to determine and limit the House’s powers, often beyond what the House may like.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676855">The game that the Conservatives are playing is borderline contempt in itself, and it is coming from the office of the Conservative leader.

One was in Elmwood—Transcona, where the Conservatives were badly defeated by the NDP. In LaSalle—Émard—Verdun, the Conservatives finished fourth. The Liberals were defeated in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun, and they finished with 5% of the vote in Elmwood—Transcona. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676861"> However, the reason the Conservatives did so badly in the by-elections, of course, is that people are aware of the legacy of Conservative scandals. I just have to refer back to the period of the Harper regime and the ETS scandal, which was $400 million; the G8 scandal, which was $1 billion; the Phoenix pay scandal, which was $2.2 billion; and the anti-terrorism funding, which was $3.1 billion. </ParaText>

This is what our focus is right now. We want to get to the bottom of it. There is corruption. There are allegations of criminal activity.

I am very appreciative of what he brings to the table as far as his legal input goes.</ParaText>

My party and some members of other parties in the House have tried to hold the government to account for weeks so that it performs the role it is required to for Parliament. This is the executive. We are Parliament. Parliament has responsibilities, and we are here to fulfill our roles as parliamentarians. The government is trying not to fulfill its role and is trying to make Parliament as dumbed down as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676879">The problem with that, of course, is that Canada is a parliamentary democracy, and we have a sacred trust to uphold the House's rules for Canadians. They elect representatives from across this country and make sure they bring perspectives from our various ridings to the House of Commons, where we discuss issues with our peers and share perspectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676880">We have rules here about how we make the government act, and the government is responsible to the House at the end of the day. I appreciate the ruling the Speaker came to that the government cannot avoid disclosing facts about the $400-million scam at SDTC, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, and has to provide information to the House of Commons that the Auditor General exposed as money misspent through that program. We have called for those documents. There was a vote in the House, and the majority said it wanted those documents tabled, as is the rule in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676881">Let us get back to the core of this discussion and look at the amendments. Right now, we want to extend the time, through a subamendment, to make sure we get those documents, because time is obviously being ignored by the government. We want those documents. Parliament is due those documents by its very rules. To ignore those rules at this point in time is tantamount to saying that Parliament does not matter. That is where the government is trying to get us to at some point in time, as if this is just a place we get to walk over, a hurdle we have to get through as the executive branch of government. It is not a hurdle. It is the Parliament of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676882">We are coming up on Remembrance Day next week, of course. How many people have stood for Canada to make sure we have democratic values and have the ability to elect people to the House of Commons so we can pass laws and represent the people? Democracy is sacred. If we lose it, we will miss it in its entirety, and it will be very difficult to get back at the end of the day. </ParaText>

What the government is trying to do is turn us into less of a democracy through this measure and half measure by half measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676884">This has been happening, as my colleague pointed out, for four years now. Ever since the pandemic happened, the government has thought it is not accountable. It started with the pandemic. I was elected in 2019, and 2020 came along very quickly. The government then decided that it wanted all this money control, called special warrants, and for us to authorize a whole bunch of money so that we would not even have to sit in the House of Commons and it could do whatever it wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676885">One of the main roles of the House is to make sure that we oversee the spending of the government. It brings back estimates and brings its plans to us, and we have to approve them. We have to make sure we hold onto that and hold the government to account so it is accountable for that spending. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8676886">When I was elected, it was a great honour to sit in the House. There are 338 of us from across this country, and it is a great honour to come here and meet with people across the aisle to see how we can make this country better at the end of the day. That is not happening right now. The first step to making that happen is to follow the rules of this place. One cannot tear down the rules of this place and expect us to function as a legitimate parliamentary democracy. We have to respect that we have rules on how to interact together and how the government, which is in the front bench, responds to what the House demands of it. We have demanded many things in the House, and the government has ignored a lot of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676887">I recall the government held up one of the requirements we asked of it some time ago. Members will recall that the House demanded the IRGC in the Middle East be deemed a terrorist group. That was passed by Parliament years ago, and the government decided to ignore it until it was opportune not to, doing it just four months ago during a by-election in Toronto. Suddenly this was an issue and it had to obey the House of Commons' vote, and the government acquiesced, finally. Parliament was demanding this of the government and the government ignored it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676888">Now Parliament is demanding documents, and those documents are about a $400-million scam. It is one of the many slush funds the government has. We are not the ones who initially started questioning what this was. It was the Auditor General who examined the books and said that a whole bunch of things were amiss. Think about that: $400 million and hundreds of conflicts of interest where members of a board were giving money to their own companies and were not supposed to be doing so. That is the definition of conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676889">This $400 million was put into projects that were supposedly part of what we call the green shift or the energy transition, but the Auditor General said that most of these projects did not even qualify. This was money going out the door to projects that did not even meet the requirements of a program that was vaunted. This was the government's way of getting through the new transition that was going to happen. It turns out, as the Auditor General has pointed out, and we want the documents that show this clearly, that most of those projects did not even meet the requirements of the program as they were written on paper. It was just a whole bunch of Liberal-appointed insiders paying money to their own firms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676890">That is not something Canadians will tolerate. It is not something the House should tolerate. Show us the documents, and at that point in time we and the RCMP will determine if there are charges to be laid in this respect. We are not the police. Turn these documents over so we can see what charges can be laid and what should be done in this case. It is pretty clear that a lot went amiss in this distribution of $400 million of taxpayer funds. That is on top of many other programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676891">When I look at all these things, I see that each minister in the front bench has gone out of their way to create for themselves some fund where they can write cheques. There is the SIF from the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> got a new fund this past year, the Canada growth fund. Of course, there is the Canada Infrastructure Bank, as well as a whole bunch of other funds. We are just pushing money through the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676892">Some of the stuff the government is pushing money into is just a bunch of money for its friends. It is business that should have happened anyway, but because the government has a Liberal insider friend, that friend puts an extra few million dollars in their back pocket. Even though the projects should have made sense without government input, government friends take the money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676893">We need to get back to projects that make sense for the taxpayers of this country and get the government out of this slush fund business for its friends. There are many of these examples, and we need to expose each and every one of them. This is the first one, and the Auditor General has already exposed it for what it is: an absolute scam, a $400-million scam. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676894">What I am looking for is what follows after that. When we take a look at how much money the government has spent in the last four years, it has overspent. Some of it was spent on the pandemic. Less than half of the money dispensed over the two pandemic years went toward dealing with the pandemic. Hundreds of billions of dollars went toward some kind of shift that did not happen.</ParaText>

Those decisions only arrive if we do the right thing and speak to truth all the way through.</ParaText>

I will challenge anybody here to say that in 1982, when the Charter of Rights was legitimized as part of the Canadian Constitution, the drafters anticipated that some documents would not be provided to parliamentarians because some lawyer with an opinion that might be trashed said this would contravene somebody's charter rights. This is the Parliament of Canada. It is supreme. We are demanding documents and we are due those documents. Those documents should arrive, and we are standing here upholding democracy, making sure they do arrive. Nothing further has to occur. This resolves itself when the documents get delivered in their entirety, and then we investigate what happened from there. Step one is to get those documents to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676898"> There is more misinformation going on, and I heard a lot of it again today in the House of Commons. Earlier this week, I had to put up with two ministers announcing an emissions cap in the oil and gas industry. How does an emissions cap work? An emissions cap works by shutting down production in Canada. That is the only way to do it. We have been shown many times by industry and by all the scientists involved that if we shut down a million barrels a day of Canadian oil production, it will be quickly replaced by other suppliers around the world, end of story. Everybody knows that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676899">In Canada, right now we are producing some of the most environmentally beneficial barrels of oil for the world economy, particularly for our partners south of the border. The Liberals want to penalize one industry at this point in time by using a vanity approach to what they think they are doing for the environment, but are accomplishing nothing but offshoring. That has to be challenged to its utmost, and I will stand up for people who are adding value throughout the energy supply chain in Canada, but also for the amount of technology being developed that deals with Canadian energy production to make the most efficient and environmentally friendly oil in the world. That advancement has happened significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676900"> I also need to raise this, because I am not sure everybody remembers it: Canada is not a cheap place to produce oil. The reason we produce oil in North America, but in Canada in particular, is the security involved in making sure our energy sources are provided here. Otherwise, those energy sources would be supplied by other places around the world where oil is much less expensive and much less environmentally friendly, believe it or not. This energy molecule is still the most important in the world, and we continue to move it along so that we have other sources, because putting all our apples in one basket is not a good strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676901">Ensuring we have energy from many sources, like oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and geothermal, is part of our future, but we are not going to end one without punishing Canadians and the environment, because we cannot push a transition faster than it moves. That is all there is to it at the end of day. I have addressed that very clearly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8676902"> There is other misinformation we have talked about. I saw the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stand up in the House during Question Period today and say he is standing up for Alberta oil workers, and I have never heard such nonsense. The Prime Minister, the government and the front bench are doing everything they can to punish the sector and make it seem like it is the sector that is responsible for the emissions around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676903">Yes, CO2 comes from burning hydrocarbons, but CO2 comes from every human activity. We need to try to mitigate CO2. We are doing our best, but shutting down Canada is not the solution to accomplish that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676904">I also speak to my colleague across the way from <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> because he has said a lot on this and it is always a speaking line off of the Liberal talking sheet of the day. The member talks about the contempt of my party's <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> in the House. My leader is not showing contempt; he is doing his job, his role, as the leader of His Majesty's loyal opposition. As opposed to the government's mouthpiece, he is actually sitting there holding the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676905">We have talked about this many times, the whole notion that the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> needs to have a security clearance in order to get this information. That is the government's job. The opposition leader's job is to hold the government to account on what it is actually supposed to provide here. He cannot usurp that role or he is defying his main role as the leader of His Majesty's loyal opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676906">I am going to move on to a few things the members will appreciate. I have some issues around what this country is going to look like going forward, because this country is being torn apart by the government. We need to fix this budget; it is out of control. This country is $1.3 trillion in debt, with another $50 billion going into debt this year. How much debt can Canadians assume from the current public government? It has doubled since the government came into power, and it is not turning around. This notion that government debt can continue to accumulate, and Canadians can continue to bear the burden of that, only kicks the can down the road until programs do not get delivered to Canadians who are going to need those funds going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676907">Debt-to-GDP ratio is a ridiculous notion, frankly. How much money are we spending on servicing that debt? It is $50 billion plus per year, which is about $3,000 plus per Canadian household. Therefore, 3,000 dollars' worth of government services does not arrive because we are servicing a debt that is far out of control. We need to address that. We need to make sure we fix this budget and stop spending money willy-nilly, including on a $400-million slush fund that went to a bunch of insiders, to bring that back home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676908"> We also have a $1.3-trillion deficit, which is about $100,000 per household. We can tell that to every household in Canada: “The federal debt adds an extra $100,000 to your actual debt, and you are paying the interest on that debt all the time and there is nothing you can do about it. Do not worry, everything is free in Canada. We will get you some more free programs. Do not worry about it. Nobody is going to worry about that debt. Well, your kids are going to worry about it, because somebody is going to have to deal with this.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676909">Kicking the can down the road is no way to address what we need to deliver to Canadians. Dealing with debt is something we have to focus this government on, because it thinks it just has to continue spending more, and it is going to make facts up as it goes along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676910">I did not mention the emissions cap the Liberals talked about. It ties in with the debt situation. The emissions cap is going to harm a sector that provided $45 billion to Canadians in 2022 through taxes that supply services, like health care, education and social services, across this country. I am asking how the government is going to replace that $45 billion as it does its utmost to try to shut in an industry and an asset that is the envy of the world. The government seems bent on destroying that industry. We do not know what we have until we have thrown it away; this is something we have to try to hang on to.</ParaText>

The other facts we have to look at are that the 10 warmest years on record all happened in the last decade, and that climate change itself has a real economic cost.

              <ParaText id="8676945">Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in this House and have my say about certain topics. Certainly, the SDTC scandal is one that has rocked this chamber for a long time now, and rightly so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676946"> However, before we get to that, if I might, I want to speak a little bit about Lloyd Coady, a veteran in my riding, who will turn 100 years old on November 16. I can remember clearly when I had the opportunity to be the honorary colonel for The Nova Scotia Highlanders. Lloyd and I, one Remembrance Day, were standing on the dais and he asked me if I wanted to have a push-up contest. I politely declined. Then, as we stepped down off the dais, Lloyd wanted to have a running race. Once again, I thought that it would be rather impolite to do so. That being said, needless to say, Lloyd is in incredible shape and certainly an incredible guy. He was a medic during World War II.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676947"> God bless Lloyd. I wish him many more. I hope to see him before Remembrance Day this year and, of course, on Remembrance Day as well. What a guy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676948">That being said, I suspect Lloyd would be aghast with the details of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund. When we look at this, there was a whistle-blower who testified before the industry committee in the fall of 2023. I can remember my great friend from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> telling me about this scandal day after day, and building this case, which he has been so successful at, and understanding that $400 million had been given to Liberal insiders. This whistle-blower, in the fall of 2023, accused the federal government of having carried out an egregious cover-up. Of course, that is part of the reason we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676949"> Doug McConnachie, who at the time was the assistant deputy minister at ISED, was recorded by whistle-blowers saying the following about the SDTC, “There's a lot of sloppiness and laziness. There is some outright incompetence and, you know, the situation is just kind of untenable at this point.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676950"> The Auditor General's report on SDTC was damning. It found that SDTC had not set clear guidance to support staff and the project review committee to determine whether a project met all the eligibility criteria set out in the contribution agreements. Of course, it goes on and on. We know when this was further investigated there were 186 conflicts of interest and, as I mentioned at the outset, at least $400 million of government money has been given to Liberal insiders. That is why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676951">It is interesting, I have heard much of this debate and it fascinates me that it is okay to give some of the information, such as the redacted documents, but the NDP-Liberal government does not think it is okay to give all of the information by way of unredacted documents. I do not really understand that logic because, quite frankly, it is not logical. Therefore, we begin to understand that, in essence, that is what we are talking about here today, giving the full amount of information that is available. It is okay to give part of the information to the RCMP, but it is not okay to give all of the information to the RCMP. If that does not make any sense to people, it of course does not make any sense to those of us on this side of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676952">I think it is important that Canadians understand that it is the reckless spending that causes the difficulties we end up with. I know my colleague just before me answered the question about whether Canadians might consider that borrowing money to make investments makes good sense. Certainly, there have been a lot of schemes out there. Maybe that is what rich people do. I do not know. That being said, it really would not make any sense. One could borrow money at a low rate and invest it at a high rate, generally speaking, but I do not know who has the ability to access that kind of capital and what kind of a scheme one would have to be involved with. Actually, I do know what kind of scheme one could be involved in, the SDTC scheme.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8676953"> If they knew their company was going to receive lots of money from the NDP-Liberal government, then it would make sense to borrow money to put into that company because they know their pockets are going to be flush with cash. This is, perhaps, much like the radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> has been able to do, and we will talk about the radical environment minister a bit more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676954">We know on this side of the House, it is important to talk about four pillars of moving forward and how we are going to get rid of this corruption. Axing the carbon tax, of course, is one of those things that is part of the core being, and we have asked multiple times, on this side of the House, for a carbon tax election. This adds more fuel to the fire, because we often hear that we get more back in carbon rebates than we pay in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676955">I had a very astute constituent email my office, and I thought it fascinating, because his quote really cut very closely to the quick. He said only a fool would believe we are going to give the government money, and they are going to give us more back. Whoever heard of such a thing? If we could have a scheme like that, I would suggest it would be something great to invest in. That being said, I think this is more smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand. It could be a pyramid scheme like Amway, maybe, if any of us remember those days. That is much akin to what the SDTC scandal is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676956">Back to axing the tax, the Canadian Trucking Alliance reported in September that, “In 2024, the carbon tax will add just under $2 billion to annual trucking costs in Canada. By 2030, the carbon tax will add more than $4 billion to annual trucking costs, an overall increase of about 15%. Over the 12-year tax phase in, the tax will have cost the trucking industry more than $26 billion.” For everybody out there who was watching question period today, our <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> talked about businesses being driven to the United States. Certainly, this is another scheme of the NDP-Liberal government to drive Canadian businesses south of the border where they do not have a carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676957">The article continues, “Due to razor thin margins in the trucking industry, these added costs cannot be absorbed and must be passed on to customers.” This leads us to this incredibly important point, which those of us on this side of the House have said many times. I know the member from Winnipeg probably wants to join me in reciting it, but when we tax the farmer who grows the food and we tax the trucker who ships the food, then the person who buys the food has to pay all those costs as well. They end up getting taxed over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676958">The Trucking Alliance also reported that, “virtually every good purchased by Canadian families and businesses involves truck transportation”. Anywhere we go, we obviously see that. I remember a great billboard in the United States that had a picture of a baby on it, and underneath it was the caption “this is the only thing not delivered by a truck”. The article continues, “this means those families and businesses are paying increasingly higher prices for those goods to pay for this ineffective tax.” This is something we talk about when we knock on doors and we talk to folks, to real folks, as opposed to those the NDP-Liberals talk to; I do not know who they talk to. We know the cost of living is crippling the financial lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676959">We also know the tax will cost Canadians about $30.5 billion by 2030, which works out to about $1,824 per family in extra annual costs. We know what the Parliamentary Budget Officer has said about the damaging and damning carbon tax. In May of this year, on CTV's <I>Power Play</I>, he said, “Overall, a vast majority of people will be worse off under a carbon tax pricing regime than without, and we don't expect that to change.” The NDP-Liberals want to manipulate and change the words of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, but that is a falsehood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676960">In his June 3 appearance before the finance committee, the Parliamentary Budget Officer once again confirmed that, “The government has economic analysis on the impact of the carbon tax itself... We’ve seen that, staff in my office, but we’ve been told explicitly not to disclose and reference it.” This a damaging attack by the Parliamentary Budget Officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676961">What else is going on in terms of the finances of Canadians? We know that Foodbanks Canada reported more than two million Canadians visited food banks in March 2024, which is the highest in the history of reporting.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8676962"> We look at that number of two million Canadians. My goodness, what a fantastic country we have. Why is the NDP-Liberal government spending money and driving Canadians to the food bank? When we look at Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia's food banks have reported 39,360 total visits in 2023-24, which is a 21% increase from the previous year and a 53% increase from 2019. Of course, sadly, many of those visiting food banks are children; 32.4%. Talking about the school food program, this is a problem that the NDP-Liberals have created and now, on behalf of Canada and Canadians, they want to spend some more money to solve a problem that they created by their vanity projects and their spending with abandon. Nearly 30% of food banks across Canada report that they are running out of food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676963">A report from Dalhousie University indicates that a family of four will see their grocery bills rise by over $700 in 2024. That may not seem like a lot of money to a lot of people on the NDP-Liberal side of the House. Perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not think that is a lot of money. That being said, for those of us who grew up in circumstances where we perhaps did not have a proverbial silver spoon, we know that $700 is still a lot of money. It is something that we need to be mindful of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676964">While I am talking about my childhood, I will give a shout-out to my mom, who is 91 and still living in the same trailer park that I grew up in. Hopefully, today, she is having a good day, still living independently at 91. That is certainly something. Hopefully I can repeat that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676965">These are the kinds of difficulties financially that Canadians are suffering from. The second major pillar, of course, on this side of the House, is building the homes. We know that 70% of those folks who are using food banks in Nova Scotia are residing in market rentals. When we look at the building permits from June 2024, we know that the total value of building permits in Canada fell 13.9% to $9.9 billion in June 2024, and that decreases were reported in 11 of the 13 provinces and territories. I am sure that was much to the chagrin of the former failed immigration minister, who is now the flailing and floundering <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation>. Both residential and non-residential sectors experienced that reduction. As a constant dollar basis from 2017, representing 100, the total value of building permits declined 14.3% in June, following a 13.4% decline in May. Those are absolutely damning statistics when we hear a government spending absolutely billions of dollars on its so-called housing accelerator, etc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676966">Once again there has to be a bit of commentary here. I find it absolutely egregious that the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation> wants to publish names of members on this side of the House. They have said that we should not be writing the minister while advocating for constituents. As we look at that, I do not know if there is a nicer word, but in my mind, this is like a bush league. When we write letters to the minister, even if the programs are absolutely sloppy and lazy, poorly administered and wasteful, much like the SDTC, we would expect that the bush league minister really would not be going on and on, saying that this is something we should not do. Certainly I know that the people who have put me here have an expectation that I will advocate for them. I think it would be absolutely fascinating that when we form the next common-sense Conservative majority government on this side of the House, if every letter written to a minister would be made public, and that they would be out there supporting the wonderful things that we shall do, such as axing the tax, building the homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime. However, looking at the polls, the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation> is probably going to lose his seat anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676967">Again, there have been multiple failures with substantial declines and multi-unit construction intentions are down almost 20%. The overall residential decline was led by those reductions in June.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8676968"> Since Toronto signed its housing accelerator fund agreement with the government in December, the number of units permitted is down 23.6%. As we can see, this is a sad state of affairs that continues. A StatsCan report on building permits from August reported a further 7% decline in the total value of Canadian building permits. If we say, as Liberals are wont to say, that the programs are incredible successes, why do the permits and the building of units continue to decline?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676969">CMHC reported in September that the six-month trend in housing starts decreased by 1.3%, from 246,000 units in August to 243,000 units in September. The same thing is happening in the great province of Nova Scotia. In centres with more than 10,000 people, building starts declined by 40% between September 2023 and September 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676970">Are the Liberals' programs successful? No. Certainly the program that our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has brought forward is easy to understand. It is easy to implement. It is removing the GST portion from new builds under a million dollars, saving a significant amount of money for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676971">We often, of course, talk about fixing the budget. My colleague has gone on at length about the $1.3-trillion debt and the fact that the NDP-Liberal government, over the last nine years, has added more to the federal debt than all other previous governments combined. I think that sad statistic speaks for itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676972">Of course, on this side of the House, we are also interested in stopping the crime. We know that between 2015 and 2023, hate crimes recorded by StatsCan increased by 275%. Police-reported homicides increased by 28%. Police-reported sexual offences against children increased by 153%, with 11,503 reported in 2023. There were almost 71% more sexual assaults of all kinds in 2023 than in 2015, with 36,625 being reported in 2023 across all three categories. In 2022, Canada had more homicides than in any year since 1992. There were 439 reports of human trafficking in 2023. This is almost lawlessness. There were 78,849 motor vehicle thefts reported in 2015 and 114,863 in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676973">This is a sad state, and when, of course, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of this side of the House talks about Canada being broken, certainly I would suggest that Canadians believe it when they hear the incredibly egregious statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676974">This is really telling stuff. The Toronto Police Association on social media on October 21 stated, “Our communities are experiencing a 45% increase in shootings and a 62% increase in gun-related homicides compared to this time last year. What difference does your handgun ban make when 85% of guns seized by our members can be sourced to the United States? Your statement is out of touch and offensive to victims of crime and police officers everywhere. Whatever you think you’ve done to improve community safety has not worked.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676975">Police unions in Vancouver and Surrey also criticized the government when the Vancouver Police Union tweeted that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was “not aware of the ongoing gang war here in B.C. which is putting both our members and public at risk on a daily basis.” The stats, sadly, go on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676976"> As we come to the end of my comments here today on SDTC, we also know that the radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, whom I referenced in the very beginning, has significant interest in Cycle Capital, which under the leadership of Ms. Méthot was given almost $275 million in provincial and federal money. Of course the radical environment minister, sadly, still has a significant number of shares in the company. Even though he has been challenged three times to come to multiple different committees, he has still failed to appear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8676977">I guess these questions remain: With the privilege debate ongoing and with the minister's failing to appear at committee, Conservatives on this side of the House want to know what is so damning inside the redacted documents, what there is to hide, and when Parliament can expect to see the documents, be able to debate the issue further and get back to the business at hand.</ParaText>

This magazine is very critical of the current government when it comes to housing. It indicated that the cost of housing has risen by 66% since 2015 and that Canada's per capita housing rate is very low compared to other OECD countries. The Economist said that one of the main reasons for this is that the government implemented a policy of massive immigration without a plan to support housing and social services. We have seen that there was no plan in that regard and, as my colleague said, there have been even fewer housing starts because of high interest rates. The British magazine is so harsh that it says that this problem cancels out all of the successful progressive policies implemented by the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677019">Madam Speaker, let me rephrase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677020">We agree with the Speaker when he said, “The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any and all documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties.” As such, I ask this again: Why are we here? We are here to hold this government accountable for its mess, corruption and wrongdoings. What would this motion do? The House is simply asking for these documents so that they can be turned over and scrutinized, not only by the RCMP, but by members of Parliament, because it is our privilege and our right to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677021"> Nothing in our motion calls for the RCMP to conduct any type of investigation, and this is not an abnormal request, as the House enjoys the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents, which is not limited by any statute whatsoever. These powers are rooted in the very fabric of this House, having been enshrined in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677022">Here is a quick refresher on the role of Sustainable Development Technology Canada and why it is being investigated for corruption. SDTC is a federally funded non-profit founded in 2001. It was set up to approve and disburse funds to clean-tech companies. The latest mandate for the agency was to disburse $1 billion over five years ending in 2025-26. Let us call this disbursement the “green slush fund”. The wording of “slush fund” is deliberate. A slush fund is a reserve of money used for illicit purposes, usually pertaining to political bribery, and this is no exaggeration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677023"> Doug McConnachie, the assistant deputy minister at Innovation, Science and Economic Development, and the whistle-blower who would expose the grift said that what happened at SDTC was “almost a sponsorship-scandal level kind of giveaway.” The sponsorship scandal, if members remember, is what eventually brought down the previous Liberal government of prime ministers Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien. It should be noted that both scandals share certain similarities. Both involved Liberal Party insiders and firms profiting from hard-earned dollars of taxpayers through the diversion of funds from existing government programs created by Liberal governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677024"> Let us dig into the anatomy of a scandal. Coincidentally, 2015 was when we had our new government, this Liberal government. In 2015, the mastermind of the operation, Leah Lawrence, was hired to be the CEO of Sustainable Development Technology Canada. Under her direction, SDTC essentially turned into this green slush fund for her and her friends. Rather than funding green tech firms in a fair and transparent manner, she decided to use the fund to top up the companies of her and her friends. A key player in covering up her behaviour was her partner in crime, Annette Verschuren, who was appointed chair of the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677025">Annette used her position to protect Leah. Not wanting to miss out on the fund, the entire board then also partook in the scam. To compound these issues, subcontractors on projects were often affiliated with the CEO. Clearly in the wrong, the board members tried to cover their tracks by contracting an outside legal opinion saying it was okay to fund their own companies with the bonus money. This outside opinion was from Ed Vandenberg. He is a paid SDTC member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677026">There is no lack of salacious details to add in. I just cannot make this stuff up. It is truly stranger than fiction. If anyone is wondering what the government did when it found out about these issues, the answer is nothing. Just like the arrive scam app, this government's SDTC board fleeced taxpayers, and instead of reprimanding and firing these individuals, the Liberals ignored the issue and tried to cover up this abuse of taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677027">It is not like the government was not warned. In fact, the whistle-blower referred to the initial investigation as a “whitewash”. The whistle-blowers reached out to both the government and the Privy Council Office, and despite warnings, the SDTC management team and board of directors remained in place months later. This must have been disheartening, yet, despite their claims falling on deaf ears, the eventual result was an inquiry into the matter conducted by Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton. The report confirmed that the whistle-blower complaints were actually valid and factual. Not only did the report confirm the multiple instances of corruption, but it also stated the government ignored these findings and continued to fund the organization despite being warned of the board's behaviour. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8677028">Sadly, this is not new behaviour, and it is part of a larger pattern. Over the past nine years, the government has exhibited a flagrant disregard for transparency and the rule of law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677029">Since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected, Canada has slid down the Transparency International Canada corruption perceptions index. Back in 2015, Canada placed as the ninth-least corrupt country in the world, with a score of 83 points, and we were improving. We can then fast-forward to 2022, when Canada was stuck in a tie for 14th place, with a score of 74 points. This is a loss of almost 10 percentage points. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677030">In 2022, Transparency International Canada executive director James Cohen stated, “The problem of money-laundering in Canada and other corruption scandals have been headline news in recent years dragging down the perception of Canada as a clean country. This year’s disappointing results show the need to take concrete action to restore Canada’s reputation.” Those are not exactly glowing words, and they certainly confirm what Conservatives have been saying all along. Suffice it to say that the government did nothing to rectify this perception of corruption in Canada. This is corruption that it has created and condoned; it is damaging our international reputation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677031">Is it even a surprise that we have fallen so low? Since 2015, the volume of scandals has grown from a steady stream into a powerful torrent, starting with the cash for access scandal. That worked its way up to the infamous SNC-Lavalin corruption cover-up, blackface, the WE Charity, the Mark Norman affair, arrive scam, the Winnipeg lab documents and foreign interference from state actors, such as China, India, Iran and Russia. The list of major scandals under the direction of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is too long for a 20-minute speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677032">Of the sickening levels of graft at SDTC, one of the whistle-blowers had this to say:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The true failure of the situation stands at the feet of our current government, whose decision to protect wrongdoers and cover up their findings over the last 12 months is a serious indictment of how our democratic systems and institutions are being corrupted by political interference. It should never have taken two years for the issues to reach this point. What should have been a straightforward process turned into a bureaucratic nightmare that allowed SDTC to continue wasting millions of dollars and abusing countless employees over the last year. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677034">Let us remember that, earlier on in my speech, I said that it was a $1-billion fund. Of that $1 billion, almost half of it, $400 million, is what is in question in terms of being handed out inappropriately. The whistle-blowers also claimed, “[T]he current government is more interested in protecting themselves and protecting the situation from being a public nightmare. They would rather protect wrongdoers and financial mismanagement than have to deal with a situation like SDTC in the public sphere.” It is a cover-up. That is why we are here. The Liberal government does not want to be honest or transparent even now, when it is in direct contravention of an order to produce documents that was passed by a majority of MPs in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677035"> Clearly, the government knew of the scandal and tried to hide it. It is really a testament to the moral integrity of whistle-blowers that we have this information in front of us today, and I thank them for it. For years, they had to toil in what they referred to as a “toxic” work environment, a place of work with high turnover and a culture in which loyalties were constantly tested by petty executives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677036">What is the scale of the scandal? On June 13, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> requested a breakdown of the approved funding by the SDTC board. The Auditor General found that government officials sent nearly $400 million in taxpayer funds to their own companies through inappropriately awarded contracts. In doing so, to quote myself, Blaine Calkins, they were responsible for “not one, not two, not 10, not 50, not 100 but 186 conflicts of interest.” That is truly an extraordinary number. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677037">The government may try to deflect and say that SDTC is an arm's-length organization, but this is not true either, really. Another major finding of the Auditor General's investigation was that there were several severe lapses in the governance standards. It was only after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked Liberal board members were appointed that this fund began voting for absurd amounts of taxpayer dollars for itself and hid its corrupt funnelling to board members' very own companies. In fact, the organization received a clean bill of health in 2017, before these corrupt board members were actually appointed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8677038"> Another interesting tidbit about the green slush fund is that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> served as a strategic adviser for a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital from 2009 to 2018, prior to his appointment to cabinet. The founder and owner of Cycle Capital sat on the same SDTC board that voted for Cycle Capital investments to receive a significant amount of funding. Will the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> state if he still holds shares in Cycle Capital, and if so, how much has he stood to gain from these illicit investments? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677039">If people are still not convinced of the need for these documents, please consider the words of our whistle-blower, who told the public accounts committee, “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.” Those are not our words. Clearly, the whistle-blower believes this work is important, and we, as Conservatives, stand in solidarity with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677040">In summary, we on the Conservative bench just want the government to turn over the SDTC green slush fund documents so that those responsible can be held accountable and taxpayers can know where their money went. Hopefully, we can recover some of those tax dollars for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677041">SDTC's board was appointed by the government, and it was informed of the conflicts of interest held by the executives it chose, yet the government did not act for years. Because of this, we are saddled with another corruption scandal. The Auditor General's investigation has uncovered that $400 million in SDTC funding was awarded to projects in which board members were conflicted during the five-year audit period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677042">That sum of money is nothing to laugh at, especially at a time when so many Canadians are struggling with everyday bills and affordability. These are funds that could have gone into building infrastructure, feeding the needy, tackling crime and dealing with the housing crisis that plagues our nation. Instead, the NDP-Liberal coalition government has paralyzed Parliament and made it impossible to address the serious issues facing Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677043">It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to take accountability and provide the documents outlining the conflicts of interest in the green slush fund. It is equally true that the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278162" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation>, the minister of industry, should have done a better job of monitoring SDTC. The blame lies squarely at the feet of the Prime Minister and that minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677044">I would like to leave members with a thought before I complete my speech. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> once said, “One of the most important things in any leader or in any successful approach is to focus on connecting with people and really listening to them.” It sounds like something he would say. I will just say to the Prime Minister that, if he will not release the documents, will he at least take stock of his own words and listen to the voice of Canadians, the great multitudes who are fed up with the corruption? They are telling him that it is time. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677055">Madam Speaker, the intimation that the Conservative Party is somehow propping up and extending the Parliament is simply absurd. We already had two direct motions of non-confidence that were brought forward when we reconvened here in the fall and, if I remember correctly, the member who asked me the question and her political party continue to support the continuation of the Parliament and the continuation of the Liberal government. They did not get what they asked for, so one can only assume that they are people of their word and that they will vote non-confidence at the next opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677056">Suffice to say, in the meantime, it is our job, and it behooves us all as members of Parliament, to get the root of the matter. The root of the matter is that $400 million of taxpayers' money was inappropriately used at SDTC and the green slush fund. That is money from my constituents' pockets. That is money from her constituents' pockets in Quebec. We deserve to know what those funds are. We have made a direct order as members of Parliament. We have that privilege and that entitlement to do so in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677057">The House has supremacy when it come to the order of the production of documents. It is not the first time that the government has failed to turn these documents over. If people remember correctly, we had the same problem with the Winnipeg lab documents, to the point where somebody was actually summoned before the bar for the first time in 113 years. This is a pattern with the government. It is a problem. We are either going to fold our tent and just buckle and let governments do whatever they want or we are going to stand proud as Canadians and we are going to actually restore the credibility of our nation, restore the credibility of this institution and make sure we actually get the documents that we have asked for as members of Parliament. I encourage her to stand in her place and make sure that she stands firm and that her party stands firm until we get these documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677060">I have asked this question numerous times and not a single Conservative has yet replied and that is with regard to the track record of cover-ups of the Harper regime.

The anti-terrorism funding, where they simply lost the paper trail, was $3.1 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677061">Every single one of those scandals was covered up by the Harper regime. The member was here, so he is fully aware of that. As a former House officer, he is aware as well that this was absolutely inappropriate.</ParaText>

I am proud of the track record of the previous Conservative government. I am going to be even more proud of the track record of a future Conservative government once we end the entitlement, corruption and absolute profligacy of the government, which has doubled our national debt.

              <ParaText id="8677069">Madam Speaker, there were numerous protections that we brought forward in the previous Conservative administration, starting with the Federal Accountability Act, which created opportunities for various officers of Parliament. We would not even know some of these things if it were not for the hard work done through the Federal Accountability Act. It was the first piece of legislation that Stephen Harper brought forward, Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>, back in 2006, if my memory serves me correctly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677070"> Part of that work was strengthening protections for whistle-blowers. I think there is even more that we could do now because there is a culture of secrecy and fear in the government. In some cases, I hear these things. We need to make sure that people feel not only encouraged to, but also secure in coming forward with information of wrongdoing in the Government of Canada. We should not have a culture of secrecy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677071"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spoke of “sunny ways”, “transparency” and sunlight, but we have seen everything but in the last number of years from the government with the amount of money it has spent and the money that has gone out the door. We do not even know about some of the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars that were spent during COVID. There is no traceability or accountability with respect to that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677076">Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate I have to rise to speak to this issue. This could have ended days ago had the Liberal government capitulated and shown the documents. It is obviously very frightened to show Canadians the level of scandal that is in those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677077">What we as parliamentarians are now facing is a Parliament, a House of Commons and a government in complete crisis. The lengths that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office will go to cover up this latest scandal is incredible. To basically shut down Parliament and not have any government business happening just to protect their own hide is very disingenuous to the members who are here, as we represent our constituents, and certainly to every Canadian who expects better from their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677078"> All parliamentarians represent those constituents who elected us, those families in our ridings who put their trust in us to represent them here. It is their privilege that we are demanding be honoured. The Speaker has ruled that the Liberal government should be handing over the documents, to show that Canadians can make that decision for themselves and determine accountability if there is a scandal. It certainly seems the whistle-blowers and others have highlighted $400 million in misappropriated taxpayer funds. Canadians have the right to see those documents. Canadians, who elected us to be here, have the right to make that determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677079"> What is at stake here is accountability in the House of Commons, where transparency and trust for all of us should be paramount, not just for the government in power. It is wielding that power as a sledgehammer over the House of Commons and over Canadians. I think we all would agree that oversight and transparency in Parliament are paramount to ensure that the trust of Canadians in what we do here is upheld. I certainly do not think that is happening right now, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Prime Minister's Office are refusing to comply with a decision by the Speaker to produce those documents. The government is doing everything it can to hide that from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677080">This comes at a time when Canadians are frustrated. They are angry. They are struggling to make ends meet every single day. More than two million Canadians are visiting a food bank in a single month. Food insecurity in Canada is up 111%. Food inflation in Canada is 36% higher than it is in the United States. While Canadians are struggling, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal-NDP government are taking Canadians' tax dollars and lining the pockets of their friends and insiders. We have hundreds, if not thousands, of homeless encampments popping up all across Canada. In Alberta, food bank use is up more than 35%. I have heard similar stories right across Canada. We saw a report the other day from Mississauga where food bank use was up 60%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677081">While Canadians are struggling just to put food on the table, the Liberal government is lining its pockets and the pockets of its friends with the dollars of Canadian taxpayers. The level of this scandal is something many of us have never seen before in Canada. The RCMP commissioner has confirmed that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked directors in what we call the green slush fund are already under criminal investigation. Nine green slush fund board appointees have been implicated in funnelling this $400 million to their own companies. The chair of the green slush fund board was hand-picked by the Prime Minister even though he was warned multiple times of a conflict of interest. Once again, the Prime Minister got his own way and did not care about a conflict of interest or the integrity of his government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677082">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked board of directors was funnelling $400 million of taxpayer money to their own companies. That is unbelievable. It did not happen a couple of times; it happened more than 180 times. There was a blatant disregard for conflicts of interest, ethics, integrity and the sanctity of taxpayer dollars. It is one thing, maybe, to do something once or twice, like, “Okay, we made a mistake,” but to say, “Oh, we did it once or twice and we got away with it. Let us just keep going and see how far we can get with this,” and then do it more than 180 times is just unreal.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8677083">What we have now is the Liberal government, not only defying an order of this House to produce those required documents and turn them over to the RCMP but now obstructing justice by refusing to co-operate with that RCMP investigation. The Liberals are deliberately trying to distract and delay by wanting to send this to committee, wasting more time and more energy instead of giving Canadians the transparency they deserve right now by tabling those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677084">As I said when I spoke to this previously, when my home is robbed, I call the police. I do not ask my neighbours to get together and form a committee to discuss that robbery. That is what Canadians are asking for. The Liberals have robbed Canadians of their tax dollars, and Canadians are asking to call the police for an investigation into the misappropriation and mishandling of their tax dollars. The scale of this corruption is just disgusting, and Canadians are certainly outraged about how the Liberals are taking advantage of their position yet again. It is a story we have heard over and over from the current Liberal government, in particular, of enriching Liberals' friends and the government's insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677085">This <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has taken scandals, conflicts of interest and abuse of taxpayer money to new heights like no prime minister before. Insiders, bureaucrats and special interest groups have become fabulously wealthy under the current Liberal government, while Canadians are struggling every single day just to put food on the table, put fuel in their car, heat their homes and try to buy that first home. There has been $54 million for arrive scam, $237 million to a former Liberal MP for unused ventilators, $150 million to SNC-Lavalin for unused field hospitals and $12 million for Loblaws to buy new fridges and freezers despite record profits for that retailer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677086">I am not given enough time to go through every single scandal that the Liberals have endured in their nine years in government. However, I think my colleagues would really like to hear some of the greatest hits. This would make a best-selling K-TEL album. I may be dating myself with K-TEL, but <I>Hit Express</I> was one of the best ones ever, so I am going to give my colleagues my version of <I>Hit Express</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677087">First, we had the Aga Khan scandal. Canada's Ethics Commissioner ruled that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had indeed broken the conflict of interest rules, accepting vacations and gifts and flights from the Aga Khan in 2016. It was the first time in our history that a prime minister had been found to have committed such a transgression. He is the only Prime Minister to be found guilty of fraud and the Prime Minister gave himself consent to break that law that is in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677088"> Now, we will move to the SNC-Lavalin affair. Former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused her own government and its officials of inappropriately pressuring her to make a decision on the SNC-Lavalin affair to avoid a corruption trial. That affair led to the resignation of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s top aide, Gerald Butts; the minister herself, Ms. Wilson-Raybould; and Michael Wernick, the head of the federal bureaucracy at that time. Former public works minister, Jane Philpott, quit, citing her loss of confidence in the Prime Minister, and that the Prime Minister did indeed politically interfere with his own justice minister to try and save his friends at SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677089"> Then, once again, when Canadians were at their most anxious and most stressed in the midst of a pandemic, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> found yet another opportunity to try to enrich his friends. When Canadians were struggling, businesses were closing and kids were not in school, the Prime Minister, instead of helping Canadians, found a way to help his friends with the WE Charity scandal, which had previously paid nearly half a million dollars to his close family friends to appear at their events, despite claims to the contrary. However, the Liberals continued to double down with WE, trying to give the charity tens of millions of Canadian taxpayer dollars to run some programs through the pandemic. The Liberals defied the order once again in Parliament and blocked key players at WE from testifying at the ethics committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677090"> We will go back a bit further to an illegal casino magnate. I don't want people to forget about these, so I want to bring back some blasts from the past. In 2016 and 2017, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> participated in fundraising events in Toronto and Vancouver that featured wealthy entrepreneurs. The architect of a heavily armed illegal casino operation in Markham twice had FaceTime calls with the Prime Minister and, surprise, he also has ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Also at those meetings was a Chinese billionaire and member of the Chinese people consultative conference, who made a $1-million donation to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which was reported in The Globe and Mail. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8677091">In 2016, one of several additional scandals, all the way back when one of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s first scandals with a newly elected government, surrounded his attendance in the United States at pay-for-play fundraisers featuring billionaires with connections to the communist regime in China. Perhaps the most concerning is that the Liberal government openly ignored warnings from the House of Commons about attempts by communist Beijing to swing the results of two federal by-elections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677092">In early 2023, most of the board of directors resigned from the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation in light of a $200,000 donation from political strategists and a billionaire with connections, once again, to the Communist regime in China. The foundation misled Canadians when it said the controversial donation made by two Chinese businessmen qualified as a Canadian donation. However, not surprisingly, emails revealed that the foundation corresponded with the China Cultural Industry Association, an arm of the Communist Party in Beijing. They contain the name that should be listed on the tax receipts for the donation, and where they were to be sent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677093">I do not know who does the oversight with the Liberal government; perhaps there is no oversight; that is obvious with the number of scandals there have been, including the one involving Jaspal Atwal. Photographs surfaced of Mr. Atwal posing with Canadian officials, and he obtained a travel visa and secured invitations to formal events with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the official tour to India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677094">The Liberal research bureau, a taxpayer-funded office, paid $75,000 in public funds to Data Sciences, a company owned by Tom Pitfield, a Liberal strategist who ran the last two digital election campaigns for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and who is a childhood friend of the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677095">Who could forget the arrive scam app? It is just another case of the government's spending way more money on something that would have taken a reasonable amount of time and a reasonable amount of money to develop. However, for the glitchy, often-criticized mobile app that was an absolute disaster and mandatory for Canadians during COVID-19, the initial budget was $80,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677096">The app ended up costing, from what we know, and it could be way more, at least $60 million. The ridiculous thing is that the company that was asked to build the app, GC Strategies, had only two employees and did no IT service whatsoever, yet when the bills kept coming in to the government, and the bill kept getting higher and higher, no one said a thing. The government just kept paying the bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677097">I am sure the folks at GC Strategies wondered how far they could push it, how many times they could go to the well before they got their fingers tapped a little bit. Apparently they could go 60 million times before anyone within the Liberal government and the bureaucracy said, “We started at $80,000; we are now at $60 million. Did we miss a zero somewhere, or is this legitimate?” Obviously it was not legitimate. Canadians still have not gotten their money back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677098">That was a regular occurrence with the government, as cabinet ministers have handed out sole-source contracts to friends and family. The <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">international trade minister</Affiliation> spent $20,000 in media training for a close friend and staffer inside the office of the housing minister, who also paid $93,000 in constituency funds to his sister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677099">Liberals also awarded nearly $100 million in contracts to their good friends at McKinsey &amp; Company, flouting procurement rules along the way. The report sparked serious concerns about cronyism in the government's outsourcing of its contracts. McKinsey management has long-standing and deep ties to the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677100">McKinsey employed Dominic Barton as its global managing director from 2009 until his appointment as ambassador to China in 2019. Of 28 competitive bids, six appear to have been designed specifically with McKinsey in mind, based on the job description. This was a way for the Liberals to justify awarding the contracts to McKinsey. They had sourced them through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, which was also concerned about McKinsey's growing influence on their policy, without any public knowledge.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677102">We now have the story of two Randys. There is a <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Alberta. I honestly do not know how the minister goes back to his riding in Edmonton, looks his constituents in the face and says there are two Randys, but he is not the Randy they are looking for. We know he is misleading his constituents and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677103">There are not two Randys. The emails prove it. I would implore the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton to just come clean. It was his own company. He was still a shareholder and still had decision-making power when the company was getting government contracts during the pandemic. I hope he goes home to his riding and comes clean with his own constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677104"> We now have Tom Clark. The Liberal-NDP government decided to purchase a $9-million luxury condo on Billionaires' Row in New York. Just this week, Politico reported that Tom Clark was encouraging the government to purchase this new condo because his living standards in Manhattan were just unlivable. He first said he knew nothing about this purchase. I cannot imagine the squalor that Tom Clark was living with in Manhattan, when we have 1,400 homeless encampments just in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677105">Worse still, the decision to purchase this condo was only made after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> visited Tom Clark in New York City; soon after, Global Affairs Canada decided to make this purchase on Billionaires' Row.

              <ParaText id="8677107">We now have a new one that I am not even sure many of my colleagues are aware of. The CRA was duped out of $40 million. In the summer of 2023, a Canadian taxpayer logged on to his CRA account and falsely amended his tax returns; the CRA paid out $40 million in fake tax returns. The worst part is that it was not the CRA that made the discovery that it was inadvertently paying out $40 million. It was CIBC, the taxpayer's bank, that raised the alarm. It was odd that this one person was getting $40 million from the CRA. How lax are the accountability and the metrics within the government if $40 million just goes missing without anybody blinking an eye?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677108">I wish I could say all this is surprising, but it just seems to be a regular occurrence with the government. We go on and on with these scandals. The truth is that these are not oversights or missteps. This is a habit. When we have a couple of mistakes, I think we can overlook them somewhat, but this is now tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money. The Liberals are lining the pockets of their friends, Liberal insiders and people within the party.</ParaText>

The member can look at the graph that is there; I would be happy to share it. The one factor making the difference is when the carbon tax increases every April, there is another spike in that difference between Canada and the United States in food inflation. One of the factors is that we have a carbon tax in Canada, and the United States does not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677137">I rise to add my voice to the important discussion we are having to hold the Liberal government to account for its refusal to provide documents in response to a House order. In particular, with this subamendment, we want to ensure that reasonable time is given to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to hear from witnesses and report back to the House. That debate, as we all know, has been a long one. However, the substance of the motion, amendments and subamendments matters because of the crucial issue we are dealing with: accountability in handling public funds, specifically those allocated to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, as it is known in the House. It is perhaps better known to Canadians as the Liberal green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677138">The aim of this debate, and the reason we must continue our efforts to hold the Liberal government to account, is transparency. It is to obtain files, agreements, conflict of interest declarations and minutes of SDTC's board and project review committee. This is not an unreasonable request. Ensuring that public funds are managed with the highest standards of integrity is the role of all of us in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677139">The Speaker ruled that the Liberals violated a House order to turn over evidence to the police for a criminal investigation into the $400-million Liberal scandal. However, compliance with this order has been far from acceptable. Many government entities either failed to produce the documents required or submitted versions so heavily redacted that they are practically useless. The Liberals' refusal to table these documents has left Parliament paralyzed, hindering our ability to do the work we were elected to do. I will have more to say on that later. For right now, at issue is the question of why the Liberals have refused to comply with the binding House order to produce documents related to SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677140">We know that the Auditor General conducted a thorough investigation into SDTC's governance after a whistle-blower came forward. She determined that these complaints were rooted in serious issues within SDTC, and her investigation shockingly uncovered, as many of my colleagues have said, nearly 400 million dollars' worth of contracts that were inappropriately awarded by the board of directors, all of whom had multiple conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677141">The mishandling of SDTC, or the green slush fund, was stark. This program was designed to support innovation in sustainable technologies. Originally established in 2001, it operated with few issues under both Liberal and Conservative governments, that is until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677142">The Auditor General released a damning report earlier this year revealing that $123 million had been misappropriated by the board of SDTC. The report outlined serious governance failures, including 90 instances where conflict of interest policies were not followed. It allowed $76 million to be spent on projects connected to friends of the Liberals who sat on the board, $59 million to be awarded to projects that were not eligible for funding and $12 million to be spent on projects that were conflicts of interest and were straight up ineligible for the funding. This represents a real betrayal, the betrayal of public trust. It represents a failure of effective oversight. It represents a culture of corruption that has troublingly flourished under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677143">I, like so many Canadians, am tired of watching the Liberal government drift from scandal to scandal, as just outlined by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278374" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation>, wasting millions of taxpayers' dollars along the way. This is not to mention refusing to be completely transparent when the Liberals are finally caught and held to account.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8677144"> We were reminded of the lack of transparency and forthrightness at the public accounts committee just the other day, when the former Liberal minister overseeing SDTC made little effort to meaningfully answer even the simplest of questions. Throughout his testimony, Navdeep Bains said 16 times that he could not recall, did not know or did not receive details about the activities of SDTC, but he was only the minister in charge. With so little attention given by the minister overseeing the fund, it is almost no wonder that so much mismanagement and so many conflicts of interest have been identified. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677145">Despite what we have heard from some Liberal members, I want to emphasize that pushing for transparency is not an attack on privacy or due process. Instead, it is a call for accountability. Adding the Privacy Commissioner and other key figures as witnesses in this investigation is an important way to ensure a fair and thorough review. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677146">Former minister Bains, choosing to ignore several warnings about her conflicts of interest, proceeded with the appointment of Annette Verschuren as SDTC chair after removing the previous chair. Under the watch of this Liberal appointee, conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed by the board. For example, board members would grant SDTC funding to companies in which they held stock or positions. Former minister Bains appointed five more board members, who engaged in similar behaviour by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership or seats on the board. Meanwhile, officials from the Department of Industry, Science and Economic Development sat on the board as observers and witnessed 96 conflicts of interest but did not intervene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677147"> In January 2021, former minister Bains was replaced by the current minister, and in November 2022, whistle-blowers began raising internal concerns with the Auditor General about the unethical practices of SDTC. In February of last year, the Privy Council was briefed by whistle-blowers and two independent reports were commissioned. Then, later in September 2023, the allegations became public. However, it took the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> a month to move to suspend funding to the organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677148">An Auditor General investigation followed, and her investigation made it abundantly clear that the failures uncovered by SDTC lie squarely at the feet of the former Liberal minister of industry, who failed to ensure proper oversight or governance. Instead, he turned a blind eye when it was revealed that public money was being funnelled to Liberal insiders, which brings us to today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677149">The Liberals continue to cover up this scandal by not tabling the requested documents on SDTC. It is notable that the Privacy Commissioner, unlike many other officials, followed the House's direction and produced unredacted documents. This is significant because the Privacy Commissioner understands the balance between transparency and privacy rights better than perhaps any official. He is someone who understands the stakes and the intricacies involved, and he found it reasonable to release unredacted documents. However, we are continually met with the Liberal government's objections to these disclosures, which its members claim could infringe on privacy rights or cause other harms, not to mention the harms they are already causing. If the Privacy Commissioner, the foremost expert on such matters, deems it acceptable to release these documents, it strikes me as fair to question the sincerity of these objections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677150"> Let us return for a moment to the Auditor General's findings, which are very serious and concerning. Her office randomly received a subset of SDTC's contracts and discovered troubling patterns in the majority of them. Her findings indicate that a significant portion of the funds managed by SDTC may have been misallocated through conflicts of interest, mismanagement or perhaps even misconduct. Canadians have a right to know if their tax dollars are being spent appropriately and effectively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677151">The government's reluctance to provide the full unredacted documents requested by the House should give us all pause. By bringing forward witnesses, including the Privacy Commissioner, the RCMP commissioner and key members of SDTC, we can deliver the further transparency that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8677152"> The fact is that Liberal appointees gave nearly 400 million tax dollars to their own companies, which involved 186 conflicts of interest. That is nearly $400 million being wasted, or stolen, while so many of our fellow Canadians cannot afford the cost of groceries, gas and home heating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677153">I want to dwell on this point for a moment. The House continues to be paralyzed at a time when Canadians need real results. They need action on measures to improve affordability, whether we are talking about food, fuel or housing, and action on measures to get tough on crime. The NDP-Liberals are trying to create a false choice. They are telling Canadians that they should not be held to account for $400 million of wasted or stolen tax dollars. They are telling Canadians that Parliament can only return to other business by letting these troubling details fall by the wayside. That is the false choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677154"> Parliament could return to other important business immediately if the Liberal government were to simply provide the documents it has been ordered to provide. It is that simple. It can just end the cover-up and hand over the evidence to the police so Parliament can get back to work for Canadians. The government needs to end the cover-up and let us talk about affordability for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677155">After nine years of the Liberal government, life costs more and work does not pay. The Liberal carbon tax has driven up the cost of everything. Families were left to pay $700 more for food this year than they paid in 2023, forcing them to eat less, skip meals, buy less food or buy less healthy food just to make ends meet. The government needs to end the cover-up and let us discuss what happens when we tax the farmer who makes the food, and the trucker who ships the food, with a carbon tax. Spoiler alert, we end up taxing the Canadians who have to buy the food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677156">The Canadian Trucking Alliance says that the Liberal carbon tax added $2 billion to trucking costs this year, a number that will rise to $4 billion by 2030. However, these figures only account for long-haul trucking. The total cost to the trucking industry is likely significantly higher, and these higher costs are inevitably passed on to consumers.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8677158">Madam Speaker, here in the House of Commons, Conservatives have repeatedly made our priorities clear. We stand for the common sense of the common people. We stand for the common good. We defend the interests of everyday, extraordinary Canadians, who work hard and play by the rules. They are people who expect their tax dollars to be treated with respect and who expect a government to uphold the idea of a common citizenship aimed at securing the common good together, rather than elites who try to divide us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677159">The sad reality is that, for nine years, we have been governed by a radical NDP-Liberal coalition that has sought to advance the interests of well-connected insider elites at the expense of the common people. That is no more evident than in the case of the government's cozy relationship with the elite insider consultants at McKinsey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677160">I am following up tonight on a question I asked about the government's close relationship with McKinsey and work done by the Auditor General on that. This work revealed that, in about 200 million dollars' worth of contracts, most did not properly follow the rules. The government was clearly making efforts to support McKinsey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677161">How this came about was that Dominic Barton, who is closely associated with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and people in his inner circle, was given the role of senior economic adviser to the government. In the context of that role, he had access to the Prime Minister to provide advice and so on. At the time, he was the managing partner for McKinsey. At the same time, consultants at McKinsey who were working under him were selling to the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677162">Consultants were able to take advantage of this relationship to sell management consulting contracts to the government. That preferential relationship really benefited McKinsey. It allowed McKinsey to do more business under the Liberals, by massive amounts, than it ever had before. From the beginning, the government was serving the interests of well-connected, elite insiders. It has come to do so more over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677163">What did Canadians get for these hundreds of millions of dollars that were sent to McKinsey, which the Auditor General said did not follow the rules? We received advice that could and should have been offered from within the public service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677164">Meanwhile, who are these consultants at McKinsey, the people the Liberals have chosen to be preferred beneficiaries of these advice contracts in government? McKinsey has a sordid record of involvement in scandal all over the world. Most notably, McKinsey advised Purdue Pharma on how to supercharge sales of opioids and, effectively, supercharge the opioid crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677165">This is another example, frankly, of how insider elites were able to cash in at the expense of common people. Many everyday people were prescribed opioids as a result of the false overpromotion of these products by Purdue, which was aided by McKinsey. In fact, they were disproportionately working Canadians; maybe because of physical labour, they were more likely to have workplace-related physical pain. This led to addiction, resulting in so much pain and suffering, which continues today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677166">The elite insiders at Purdue and at McKinsey were able to cash in, and they are still benefiting from government policy. Purdue produces Dilaudid for government-funded so-called safe supply programs, and McKinsey has benefited greatly from contracts with the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677167">Why is the government so bent on supporting McKinsey instead of advancing the interests of the common people? It is a real shame.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677168">Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan talks about common sense. My mother used to say that common sense is not all that common, and every time I hear him speak, I realize how right my mother was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677169"> Our government takes its responsibility as stewards of the public purse very seriously, and we are committed to making sure that government spending stands up to the highest levels of scrutiny. We welcome and accept the findings and recommendations of the Auditor General with regard to her most recent report on the procurement of professional services. The findings are very much in line with several previous internal and external reviews.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677170">Let me remind the member across the way that independent audits of McKinsey found no evidence of political interference. The joint Treasury Board and Public Services and Procurement Canada review, however, reinforced that there are always opportunities to further improve and strengthen the Government of Canada's procurement practices, and that is exactly what we have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677171"> PSPC is the federal government's central purchasing agent and is committed to conducting procurements in an open, fair and transparent manner. Of course, the Government of Canada already has solid regulations, procedures and guidelines in place to make sure that happens in every department. However, we are always looking for ways to continuously improve our processes, to make them more rigorous and to ensure decisions and justifications are properly documented along the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677172">To that end, PSPC has already instituted several changes. These include introducing a mandatory requirement for all contracting authorities to retain all and any documents related to contractual decisions for professional services. They also include changing how the department administers non-competitive national master standing offers by ensuring justifications are on file and that a challenge function occurs. In addition, the department has created a new position of chief, contract quality assurance and records compliance. This will help to ensure that critical elements of decision-making throughout the procurement process are properly documented, that guidelines and tools are put in place and that quality is being actively monitored. These efforts are consistent with PSPC's commitment to continuously improving government procurement practices more broadly, and I can say that we will keep looking for ways to strengthen the integrity of government procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677173"> Regarding the Auditor General's June 2024 report, we accept her recommendation to further strengthen measures to appropriately report and monitor potential conflicts of interest. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat now has new mandatory procedures that provide an additional check and balance for managers to reinforce their responsibilities and accountabilities when undertaking professional services procurement activities. As a department that has a proactive and rigorous process to identify conflicts of interest in the procurement process, PSPC is supporting the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat in the implementation of its new mandatory procedures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677174"> I want to thank the Auditor General and her team for undertaking this review and for their findings and valuable recommendations. They will help us continue to improve our processes and ultimately strengthen the integrity of federal procurement and professional services. Our government will always do all that is possible to ensure the best value for Canadian taxpayers with all government procurements. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8677180">Madam Speaker, I am rising to follow up on an immigration question I had asked the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> just a few weeks ago. I want to quote directly from the immigration levels plan that was tabled. It states on page 8, “Canada is in the midst of a housing crisis – highlighted by the insufficient supply of rental units and family homes. In this context, any population growth, which generally necessitates a corresponding increase in housing supply, puts additional strain on the overall supply and affordability of housing.” It goes on to cite how deep the housing crisis has become over the last few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677181">It is an interesting quotation because it is the first time I have heard the government publicly admit that it has created a housing crisis in this country through its own policies. In fact, if we go back to October 2015, the month before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took power, people only needed 39% of the median pre-tax household income to afford the cost of home ownership, to be able to purchase a home. Now it is almost 60%. CMHC reported that housing starts continue to decline and the six-month trend reveals a 1.9% decrease from 246,972 units in August to 243,759 units in September. Housing starts are down 15% year to year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677182">Why did I talk about housing when I am talking about immigration? It is because two years ago, in a briefing note prepared by IRCC officials to the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation>, they warned him that repeat record-high immigration levels in previous target plans would lead to a housing crunch. It would lead to a housing crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677183">I have a simple question for the parliamentary secretary. Why did the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> ignore those warnings from officials in 2022 and why did it take him two full years before he acted to reduce immigration levels from their record highs? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677184">Madam Speaker, the member's question gives me an opportunity to talk about how our immigration plan is adapting to the needs of our economy and communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677185">We are listening to Canadians and taking action, as we have done since we formed government in 2015. For the first time, our levels plan sets targets for temporary residents, which include international students and temporary foreign workers, as well as for permanent residents. This approach to welcoming newcomers will help preserve the integrity of our immigration system while responding to community needs and positioning newcomers for success by having adequate resources to support them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677186">Immigration is essential for our economy and accounts for nearly all of Canada's labour force growth. Following the pandemic, we brought in temporary measures when we faced a severe labour shortage. The plan worked by helping our economy navigate a challenging period and recover more quickly, and prevented a recession. Our levels plan reaffirms our commitment to reducing temporary residence volumes to 5% of Canada's population by the end of 2026. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677187">While we also reduce our permanent residence target, we will increase our focus on attracting the skilled workers we need to build new homes and provide patient care. We remain committed to reuniting families and are continuing our humanitarian tradition of resettling refugees. These lower targets for both temporary and permanent residents are expected to reduce the housing supply gap by roughly 670,000 units by the end of 2027. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677188">On that side of the House, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> speaks out of both sides of his mouth. Two years ago, during the pandemic, he said he would “remove gatekeepers to allow faster immigration". Just this year, he went to a community event and said we need to “end the deportations”. He said, “We have a worker shortage in Canada. We have a demographic problem. Our population is too old...[and] we need these workers in our country." A few months later, he went to a different community and said the opposite. He promises different things to different people. Canadians cannot trust a word he says. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677189">On this side of the House, we will always listen to Canadians all across the country. We are aware of the existing challenges and we are acting to address Canada's evolving needs. Our immigration plan will support our economy while responding to the pressures faced by families and communities. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677195"> Madam Speaker, we know that the cost of living in Canada has never been higher. Life has become unaffordable for far too many Canadians, and this historic cost of living crisis is not by chance. It is a direct result of the NDP-Liberal government's inflationary taxes and reckless spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677196">The Liberals' costly and punishing carbon tax is significantly adding to the cost of gas, groceries, home heating and all basic necessities. Their failed carbon tax is pushing Canadians to the brink. The NDP-Liberals are still hell-bent on making things worse for Canadians. The NDP-Liberals' plan to quadruple the carbon tax by 2030 is only going to further drive the cost of everything up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677197">While the Liberals dive deeper and deeper into the pockets of hard-working Canadians, they have the audacity to stand in this place and tell Canadians over and over again that they are making them richer with the carbon tax. This is simply not true and Canadians know that this is not true. Parents who are skipping meals or who are lined up at food banks know that it is not true. Canadians who are living at unsafe or uncomfortable temperatures to save on energy costs know that it is not true. Seniors who are reportedly going without medicine to keep their heat on certainly know that it is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677198">No matter how many times the NDP-Liberals tell Canadians they are putting more money in their pockets, Canadians know the realities of the bills that they are facing. The NDP-Liberals may want to turn a blind eye to the suffering they are causing Canadians, but the numbers will not let them. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has once again confirmed that the NDP-Liberal carbon tax is impoverishing Canadians. The PBO's latest report on the carbon tax proves this and it proves it using the NDP-Liberals' own numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677199">Of course, we all recall that these were the numbers that they desperately tried to hide. The NDP-Liberals literally tried to silence the Parliamentary Budget Officer from exposing the truth about the impact of their carbon tax with a gag order. That is the length the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is willing to go to in his effort to hide the fact that his carbon tax is nothing more than an expensive scam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677200">Despite what the NDP-Liberal government members say, the indisputable truth is that the carbon tax is making most Canadians poorer. The PBO has confirmed that Canadians will suffer a net cost, and that Canadians are paying more in the carbon tax than they will ever get back in rebates. In Saskatchewan, that is about $894 more for the average person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677201">It is absolutely shameful that Canadian families who are already struggling to make ends meet are facing additional financial pressures because of the costly coalition. In the midst of an ongoing affordability crisis, the NDP-Liberals hiked their carbon tax by 23% last spring, and they remain hell-bent on quadrupling it. Canadians are desperate for some relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677202">The reality is Canadians need help now. The Liberals and their NDP partners just do not get it. Conservatives would restore the Canadian promise that hard work is rewarded so that families do not have to decide between keeping a roof over their heads or putting food on the table. It is time for a carbon tax election so that common-sense Conservatives can offer Canadians some much-needed relief.</ParaText>

People on a lower income receive a lot more back through the Canada carbon rebate than they pay, and that is well documented in Saskatchewan by people who are working with folks who visit food banks. Another well-known Saskatchewan-based economics professor said that the misleading information has led to the belief that most Saskatchewan residents pay more, which is false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677207">In addition to the article I mentioned, I read an anecdote from Alan Holman, a man from Saskatoon who is on disability assistance. He says that without the Canada carbon rebate, he would have to scale back on spending for his everyday needs. He says that the Canada carbon rebate that he receives four times a year from the federal government is crucial for his household budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677208">Also from Regina is Peter Gilmer, who is an advocate with the Anti-Poverty Ministry in Regina. He says that people on low income rely on the rebates to pay for the essentials. He also says, “For the vast majority of low-income people, whether they’re on income security programs or earn low wages, they’re actually better off in terms of the bottom line when receiving the rebate and paying [the carbon levy].”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677209">Time and time again, members from the Conservative Party stand up in the House and talk about the hunger report from Food Banks Canada. The aforementioned event that my colleague and I have co-hosted here on the Hill was with Food Banks Canada. She will recall that every year, when representatives of Food Banks Canada come, they make four recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677210">In its 108-page report this year, Food Banks Canada did not mention carbon pricing, because it knows there is no tax on groceries. Conservative members continually stand in the House to mislead Canadians to suggest that carbon pricing applies to food, but it simply does not. The Food Banks Canada hunger report would have indicated that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677211">If it were simply a case of removing the carbon price from food, that would be a simple fix, but there is not a carbon price on food, and actually the leading driver of higher food costs in Canada is climate change itself. If we bury our heads in the sand and pretend that climate change does not exist and is not impacting our daily lives, and if we just say it is somebody else's problem because we are a smaller country by population so other people ought to fix it first, well, I will say that in Canada I know that we all believe we are leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677212">I will finish by stating the four recommendations that Food Banks Canada has made to the federal government and to all governments across Canada: first, rebuilding Canada's social safety net; second, solving the affordability crisis; third, helping workers with low incomes make ends meet; and fourth, addressing northern and remote food insecurity and poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677213">There are policy recommendations on all four, addressing the key issues. We have been rebuilding Canada's social safety net. One of the ways is through dental care. I just ask the member opposite, if she is going to quote Food Banks Canada, to please rely on the insight and the perspective it has shared, not on the Conservatives' own political rhetoric.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677214"> Madam Speaker, we know that the NDP-Liberal carbon tax is an expensive scam. Saskatchewanians are not receiving back more than they pay into it. We know that the Liberals have failed to meet every single one of their own environmental targets, but what they have unfortunately succeeded in doing is impoverishing Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677215">The member on the other side says that food is not taxed, but he obviously does not understand how the supply chain works, especially when food is going into rural and remote communities. For anything that needs to be shipped by train, truck or car, there is a carbon tax on the fuel that is used for that. It is simply untrue to say that food is not taxed, let alone all other goods and services. When we are going to the grocery store, we are paying GST on diapers, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677216">I would just suggest that the member look at the facts. Carbon tax is on the whole of the supply chain, from the seed to the store.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8677217"> Madam Speaker, I would like to go back to Saskatchewan resident and poverty elimination expert Mr. Gilmer, and I will again read from this article because I think it is quite informing. If the member opposite does not want to listen to Food Banks Canada, perhaps she could listen to food bank workers and poverty elimination experts from her riding, or at least from Regina.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677218">In this case, an advocate says that politicians are disregarding the impact that the Canada carbon rebate has on household finances, particularly for lower income families. They are being “reckless and irresponsible”. The article repeats that “the law to impose a carbon levy [to reduce carbon emissions] was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada” and describes Mr. Gilmer as saying, “when governments get into squabbles, it's usually those with low incomes who take the brunt.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8677219">As we have seen time and time again, the Conservatives are using lower income Canadians as a prop. They are suggesting that policies that are designed to lower our emissions are hurting lower income Canadians, when they are not. Mr. Gilmer said, “We need to make sure the rebate is in place.” I could not agree more with that.</ParaText>
