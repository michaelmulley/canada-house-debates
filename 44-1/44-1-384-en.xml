I have been a member for a long time; I follow the procedure, and I am not aware of a single case in which a member who had a question of privilege, especially one with the urgent nature of that being raised, was told to wait. If there is a convention of the House I am not familiar with, I wonder if you could share even a single instance in which any member raising a matter of this nature has been told they have to wait for the convenience of another member, who is not speaking on the matter of privilege, until they are finished. Very respectfully, my understanding is no such precedent exists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769697">I know there is a requirement to provide an hour's notice, but there is also a requirement to raise the issue at the earliest possible opportunity. In fact, there are cases in which Speakers have dismissed questions of privilege simply on the basis that they were not raised in sufficient time and with sufficient proximity. I am thinking of Speaker Regan. Members are under an obligation: If they do not follow that rule, then their very serious question of privilege could be dismissed, even if it was a question of privilege deemed to have merit, simply because—</ParaText>

That is what the Conservatives have—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8769819">Madam Speaker, as I said, instead of changing things to improve people's lives, Bloc Québécois members have often supported the Conservatives. They voted with the Conservatives against the dental care plan, despite the fact that it disproportionately benefits Quebeckers. They voted against free contraceptives. They voted against diabetes medication. They voted with the Conservatives to cut assistance to Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769820">What does the NDP want to do? New Democrats understand that people need help, and they need it now. That is why we proposed removing the GST on some essential items and on monthly bills. In other words, we want to remove the tax on Internet, cellphone and heating bills, as well as on children's necessities, like diapers and clothing. Removing the GST on essentials and monthly bills is a concrete measure that will help people. The Liberals eventually gave in to our proposal because we lobbied and pushed for it, but they got it wrong. They let people down. Their proposal is not permanent, and it does not include monthly bills. The motion we are moving today fixes the problem.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8769821">Today our motion offers to give people some real help right away and to expand it to include monthly bills, like we had initially proposed, including cellphone bills, Internet bills and home heating bills, to give people permanent relief. It is a plan that would give people meaningful relief right away, and it also acknowledges that we need to fix the cheques. The cheques being proposed right now would go out to someone earning $149,000 but would not go to a senior. That does not make any sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769822">Therefore today's motion would do two things. One is to make GST relief permanent. Let us give people permanent relief and let us make sure it includes monthly bills so people can get some real relief. On top of that, let us fix the cheques.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769823">We are making it very clear, and a vote today in the House would make it very clear, that we are saying collectively that seniors, yes, deserve some help as they are some of the hardest-hit people in our country, that people living with disabilities absolutely need some help, and that someone who just started working this year should not be excluded because they just got their job. We are calling for the cheques to be expanded and for the GST relief to be permanent and include monthly bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769824">We have an important choice to make. New Democrats have always been and will always be the party of the working class. We have recently shown that very clearly, and the other parties have shown where they stand. They have shown that they do not stand with the working class. The Liberals have let down workers by making the GST relief not permanent. The Conservatives have shown that they are really on the side of the billionaires and CEOs, and they are against the working class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769825"> We are going to keep on fighting to make sure people know we have their back. Much more work is needed and much more help is needed. We are going to continue to fight for people.</ParaText>

Members are entitled to go about their parliamentary business undisturbed, and cannot be prevented from entering the chamber or a committee room for a parliamentary proceeding. This privilege can be traced back to at least the early eighteenth century, and is part of the heritage of all legislative bodies that trace their origins to the British parliamentary tradition. It is based on the pre-eminent right of the House to the attendance and service of its Members. Any obstruction of Members constitutes a breach of privilege and a contempt of the House of Commons.</QuotePara>

I have given multiple examples of different rulings from multiple different reports within the procedure and House affairs committee.

The network provides a supportive space to share strategies on how to overcome gendered stereotypes and barriers in this sector and share strategies and ideas for legislators. I look forward to seeing the WLID network grow, including members in the House and the other place. </ParaText>

That is why it produces souls worthy of those extremes. Before winter turned our forests white, 80-year-old Jean-Guy Carrier was paddling on one of our thousands of lakes with his son-in-law when their boat capsized. The two men tried to get back to shore, but Mr. Carrier did not know how to swim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769951">However, it was his son-in-law who became fatigued and whose body was being pulled to the bottom of the lake. Mr. Carrier somehow managed to pull his son-in-law to shore, with untold strength and courage, the kind that perhaps can only come from love. He was unconscious and not breathing, but Mr. Carrier managed to resuscitate him and bring him back to life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8769952">Like many others, I believe that Mr. Carrier's actions should inspire us all. Our world needs kindness. Mr. Carrier's heart was forged by the extremes of our beloved north shore.</ParaText>

While Conservatives slowed down our recovery, we have accelerated our postpandemic recovery and are now on track to have the highest growth rate in the G7.

              <ParaText id="8770176">Madam Speaker, I am rising on a point of order coming out of question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770177"> We are continuing to see this trend of questions, or preambles, where 99% of the question is on a subject that is not related to government business, and then, finally, the end of the question somehow asks the government a question. However, the Speaker has made it clear, in the past, that the proper way in which a question needs to be asked is to, at the very least, start the question by talking about some form of government business and conclude the question in the same way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770178">I believe that the Speaker has set a precedent. Today, Madam Speaker, as you represent the Speaker's decisions moving forward, you indicated that you will remove questions from individuals and cut them off. I know that it can be challenging to hear what is going on with some of the noise in here, but I think it is incumbent upon the Speaker to listen to what is going on and stop a question if it is clear that the content of the question has nothing to do with government business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770179">Government business is what the government is doing. Asking the government to call an election is not government business. I would ask, Madam Speaker, even if you were somehow to accept the fact that asking the government to call an election is government business, when 99% of the question leading up to it has nothing to do with the government but instead is asking questions of the opposition parties, you have to do something in order to get the House back in order, which might be stopping the question and it might be removing future questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770180">In conclusion, the question that the Conservatives keep asking is about something that is going to happen on Monday. It is very important to recognize, and I think it is fair to say, that throughout question period on Monday, the same questions are going to be answered because it is after question period. Please give this consideration over the weekend, so that you can handle it appropriately on Monday. </ParaText>

We are not given three and four opportunities to repeat the same question to get it on the record; it is shut down.

              <ParaText id="8770210">I am very concerned, Madam Speaker, and you have heard my frustration, that there is a very unfair application in the House because of the intimidation tactics of the Conservatives. When we get up on points of order, we are regularly shut down quickly. Conservatives can speak on as long as they want, and it allows for a gaslighting in the House. What we are asking for is a fair application. If you rule as Chair that something is not government business, that is your decision, fair play, but to allow the Conservatives to keep going and going because of the intimidation they do with shouting and trying to undermine Parliament, it makes it very difficult for the rest of us to be willing to go along with the politeness of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770239">Madam Speaker, 35 years ago, Canada was shaken to its core when a horrific act of gender-based violence devastated our country. On December 6, 1989, a gunman walked into a classroom at École polytechnique de Montréal, separated the women from the men, and brutally opened fire on the women. He took the lives of 14 young women and wounded 13 more simply because they were women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770240"> On the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, we mourn the heartbreaking loss of these young women, whose promising futures were stolen from them. Today, we remember Geneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault, Annie Turcotte and Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz. These were 14 brilliant lives cut tragically short.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770241">They were students, daughters, sisters, wives and friends. They were athletes, musicians, artists, future engineers, nurses and so much more. Each had unique talents and passions they never got to share, and we all missed out on what they could have contributed to their communities.</ParaText>

On this day, and throughout the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, we acknowledge that the misogyny, sexism and hatred that motivated the tragedy at Polytechnique remains very much a real threat for women in Canada and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770244">From 2011 to 2021, 1,125 women and girls were victims of gender-related homicide. Of these homicides, 93% were committed by a male intimate partner or family member. While indigenous women account for approximately 5% of all women and girls in Canada, they accounted for 23% of victims of homicide in 2021. In 2023, 187 women and girls were killed violently in Canada. That is one woman every two days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770245">Gender-based violence leaves lasting scars that affect all aspects of survivors' being, including their health, finances and future. When it starts early, it can echo through generations, trapping women in cycles of violence. We must engage young boys so that they know what healthy relationships look like, so we can create a world where lasting gender equality exists. We must break these cycles and create a world where every woman can live free from fear and full of opportunity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770247">We must also recognize the relationship between femicide and gun violence. According to the Canadian Women's Foundation, the single greatest risk factor of intimate partner violence becoming lethal is the presence of a gun in the home. Our government has always taken the issue of gun control seriously. We have banned 1,500 assault weapons, including the gun that was used at École Polytechnique. Just yesterday, our government announced additional measures. We are banning 324 more makes and models of assault-style rifles to keep our streets safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770248">Despite all the efforts over the last 35 years, we still have more to do, but we cannot do it alone. That is why we worked with provinces and territories to launch a national action plan to end gender-based violence and put in place bilateral agreements totalling more than $500 million over four years, allowing each jurisdiction to address their respective priorities and challenges. We owe it to every life taken too soon to take a stand and fight for a future free from gender-based violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770249">As we continue to address gender-based violence, we honour the lives taken at École Polytechnique, and we commit to doing more for those most at risk, including young women, indigenous women, Black and immigrant women, gender-diverse individuals, women with disabilities and those in rural communities. Today and every day, let us remember that we all have a role to play in creating a future where all women can live free of violence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770250">Mr. Speaker, December 6 is always a hard day. It is always a harsh wake-up call. It brings back all the trauma. Exactly 35 years ago today, the unthinkable happened. It was in Montreal, on the eve of exams. The holidays were approaching. It should have been a time for celebration, but on that day, 14 female engineering students at the Polytechnique in Montreal were murdered in cold blood, because they were women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770251">The tragedy left us stunned with horror. We could not believe what had happened. We were all in shock. These 14 young women were all university students in the prime of life. They were probably feeling carefree, like people are at that age, when they think that they have everything figured out, that they are invincible, that the world is their oyster. That is how it should have been for these women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770252">Remember the 14: Geneviève Bergeron; Hélène Colgan; Nathalie Croteau; Barbara Daigneault; Anne‑Marie Edward; Maud Haviernick; Barbara Klucznik‑Widajewicz; Maryse Laganière; Maryse Leclair; Anne‑Marie Lemay; Sonia Pelletier; Michèle Richard; Annie St‑Arneault; and Annie Turcotte.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770253">They were separated from the male students and murdered in cold blood because they were women. It is unspeakably cruel that a woman can be murdered and suffer this fate simply because she is a woman. In fact, it was so shocking that this Parliament decreed that every December 6 would be the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence against Women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770254">I was in shock when it happened. I was 22. Obviously, we were all shaken by this tragedy. I also remember the moments surrounding the event. These women were my age. They were studying at university, just as I was. They had dreams and ambitions. In an instant, all that was shattered. Understandably, there were countless collateral victims, including family, colleagues and friends. Their journey came to an end, while mine continued. For all these reasons, they will forever be in my thoughts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770255">Today we pay tribute to these women, but we also pay tribute to the women in Canada and women around the world who are victims of hate and violence in all its forms. Thirty-five years later, this day is still necessary and just as relevant. Unfortunately, intimate partner violence, sexual assault and misogynistic speech still exist. The year is not over yet, but in 2024 alone, in Quebec, there have been 25 femicides. In Canada, there have been 169 so far in 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770256">In Canada, gender equality should not even be an issue. It should be settled question. It should be absorbed and learned from an early age. Gender equality is not up for debate. Everyone needs to understand that violence is never the answer, that women need to be completely free, free to study, free to govern, free to be MPs, free to be ministers, free from fear and from all forms of violence. They should never have to be in a constant state of hypervigilance when they walk down the street, as we are far too often. Only a woman can say that these days. Only women can say that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770257">At the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, I have incredible colleagues from all parties who I work with to improve this sad state of affairs, to ensure that women can move around freely and safely. We are making recommendations to the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8770258">Respectfully, I would like to make a few observations. This is not coming from a place of partisanship. I just want to share these ideas so that we can work together to fix this very sad trend of increasing violence. Violence has increased by 116% in Canada since 2015. Whether it is sexual assault or child abuse, all this violence is happening right under our noses. In my riding, people are firing guns. We really need to put positive measures in place in order for things to improve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770259">Quebec's justice minister, Simon Jolin-Barrette, says that Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C‑5</Document>, which has been introduced in the House, allows people who commit violent acts to serve their sentences at home. Then there is Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C‑75</Document>, which allows violent offenders to be released on bail. Normally, we would not allow people who have committed such acts to serve their sentences at home or to be released on bail. This is something that worries us on this side of the House. I am not saying this in a partisan way. The police forces are telling us this. Quebeckers are very sensitive to what the Quebec government says. It was Quebec's justice minister who shared this message about sexual assault. Women are being assaulted and men are walking around free. I say men because we know that 90% of sexual assaults are committed against women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770260">Today we are paying tribute to the victims. It is nice, and we are all giving fine speeches. We are joined in sadness. However, let us also take a close look at the actions we are taking and the decisions we are making as legislators. When we realize that something is not working, that we are not getting the desired results, let us have the collective intelligence to review, in this place, the measures that have been taken. I will pick up on something that was said earlier by the minister, whom I like very much. She talked about measures that have been put in place and an action plan she wants to table. I will just make this comment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770261">I would be remiss if I did not take a few seconds to commend the organizations in my colleagues' ridings and in my own riding, such as Fondation jonction pour elle, the Centre-Femmes Bellechasse, the Centre-Femmes l'Ancrage, and the Association féministe d'éducation et d'action sociale. These are all women helping other women in need, including women fleeing violence. These women welcome them and help them move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770262">In tribute to all the injured, abused and murdered women, I say this: We must never forget them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770264">We have not forgotten them, sisters who were taken from us. We have not forgotten Geneviève Bergeron, 21, mechanical engineering student. We have not forgotten Maryse Laganière, 25, financial services employee. We have not forgotten Hélène Colgan, 23, mechanical engineering student. We have not forgotten Maryse Leclair, 23, metallurgical engineering student. We have not forgotten Nathalie Croteau, 23, mechanical engineering student.

We have not forgotten Annie St-Arneault, 23, mechanical engineering student. We have not forgotten Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz, 31, nursing student. We have not forgotten Annie Turcotte, 20, metallurgical engineering student.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770265">We have not forgotten them, and there is hope in their memory. Tonight, women and men will gather for a candlelight vigil in their honour. Tonight, there will be tenderness, love, and determination. Tonight, there will be human warmth and a willingness for things to move forward. They, my sisters, will be with us, as they have been for 35 years. Though taken from us, these women are a driving force. They push us to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770266">I am talking about hope because progress is possible. École Polytechnique has more women students than ever before. The school far exceeds the Canadian and Quebec average for female enrolment in engineering. In 2023, 34.6% of students enrolled at the Ph.D level were women. École Polytechnique exceeds 30% female enrolment year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770267">In the late 1980s, barely 15% of students were women, but that was already seen as too many because of misogyny, fear, hatred and guns. However, misogyny did not win. Fear did not win. Hatred did not win. Guns did not win. For decades, the victims of this attack have served as role models for thousands of women who carry their aspirations in their backpacks and who go on to use their degrees to help make Quebec society more vibrant and modern than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770268">My sisters must believe me. I know that the road is long, but we are also making progress on tightening gun control. We are working tirelessly and steadfastly to ensure that the weapons used against them can never be used again, either against women or against men. We still have work to do, but we are making progress with these women in mind. We must not go backwards. As we saw with the gun registry, the danger is very real. We must remain vigilant for them, for women, for our mothers, our sisters and our daughters, for the women yet to be born.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770269">We will never forget my sisters who were taken from us on December 6, 1989. We will continue to fight against violence and for the emancipation of women. We will continue the fight with them at our side. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770271">New Democrats will always remember the women of École polytechnique de Montréal who lost their lives to patriarchy and white privilege. This deadly combination continues with the upholding of male supremacy across the globe. It is called misogyny, an ingrained prejudice and contempt for women. It is misogyny that has kept women excluded from the hallways of power. It has limited their job opportunities, income, ability to move freely in the community, safety from violence or even access to the health care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770272">For indigenous women in Canada, the impacts are even more deadly. Indigenous women are killed at seven times the rate of non-indigenous women in Canada. This is a recognized genocide that has become so normalized in this country that, when an indigenous woman, girl or two-spirit individual goes missing or is killed, it barely makes the news. This reality is happening right now in Winnipeg, where murdered indigenous women have been abandoned in a landfill. It was not a given that the hallways of power would offer dignity to these women and search for them wherever they were. No, it took pressure from sisters to get it done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770273">I take a moment here to recognize the power of the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="278288" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>, who fought alongside indigenous women and their families and created a red dress alert system to find and protect indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people. This is what action on violence against women looks like. It is shameful that women and gender-diverse people in this country need to stand on guard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770274">In 35 years, misogyny has not dissipated. In fact, it has increased. With the reach of online gaming and social media, misogyny now has a new name: manospheres. There are clubs, podcasts and books. Influencers use these platforms to radicalize young males through a combination of algorithmic design, social dynamics and exposure to extremist ideologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770275">Let us remember these words: algorithmic amplification, gamification of hate, normalization of misogyny, recruitment of vulnerable men and lack of countermessaging. These are all enemies of human rights, and they are the new wave of violence against women and diverse genders. Right now, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights draws the country's attention to the fact that a “growing number of men spread hateful ideas about women, trans and nonbinary [people] online. Some internet communities even encourage and celebrate gender-based violence.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770276">The article continues, “Researchers have called for a variety of regulatory and technical improvements to reduce the reach and harmfulness of radical, hateful internet content. Simply banning users who engage in hate speech—deplatforming—has been shown to reduce their reach.” Legislatures must take action on this immediately; the Internet giants will not, because they are benefiting financially from hate and the abuse of women and people of diverse genders.</ParaText>

In response to the 2015 question of privilege in which concerns were raised about whether a 74-second delay of a shuttle bus rose to the level of a prima facie breach of privilege, one of your predecessors ruled, on May 12, 2015, at page 1379 of the Debates:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> In this light, emphasizing the notion of balance, questions raised by the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons are pertinent with regard to defining what constitutes an impediment to unfettered access for members to the parliamentary precinct and buildings. It would indeed be unfortunate for members to carry the concept of physical obstruction to illogical and unreasonable lengths. However, I would caution that the House ought not either to fall into the trap of assessing these matters on the sole basis of the duration of a delay or impediment. One can easily imagine a situation where even a very brief obstruction, depending on its severity or nature, could lead a Speaker to arrive at a prima facie finding of privilege and to allow a debate in the House.</QuotePara>

It is essential to recall that this issue, and this question of privilege, is not about some politicians looking out for their self-interest. Rather, as Bosc and Gagnon articulate on pages 59, “The privileges of the Commons are designed to safeguard the rights of each and every elector.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770303">Later, on page 60 of that same book, Bosc and Gagnon, quoting from the 20th edition of Erskine May's guide on parliamentary procedure, which says, “The privileges of Parliament are rights, which are 'absolutely necessary for the due execution of its powers'. They are enjoyed by individual Members because the House cannot perform its functions without unimpeded use of the services of its Members”. A similar point is made by Maingot, at page 12. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770317">I was stopped by PPS, who told me that I could not go in there because there were about 100 people who had stormed the building and were now occupying it. I obviously was alarmed by this. The officer went over to speak to another officer, who then said that I could go into the building and that it would be safe for me. I questioned this because my office building is located on the first floor in the Confederation Building, but I was told, “Do not worry; it is just a passive occupation.” </ParaText>

Knowing that protesters had also passed the entrance of the security portion of the Confederation Building, and some were standing outside the door of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>'s office, was very concerning for me.</ParaText>

I was actually appalled and shocked at the number of people who were sitting in the accessible entrance going through security. These were stakeholders. These were Canadians who were coming for meetings. The fact that there was chaos at the front entrance of the building, and PPS was still allowing stakeholders into the building and putting them through security, frankly and honestly, is just bananas to me.

This year's conference was on reconciliation, and the theme was “Moving Forward Together: Exploring Pathways to Reconciliation, Healing and Public Safety”. Given one of CSC’s priorities is addressing the overrepresentation of indigenous offenders, CSC deemed it was important it be actively involved to further its commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770419">CSC leveraged this opportunity to have executive committee members, 18 in total, attend the congress as well as hold their in-person executive committee meeting, which took place the day after the conference ended, at no additional cost for a meeting room. Participants stayed in campus-like accommodations at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and, during the conference, meals were included and not claimed by participants. Considering that the event took place less than a month ago, total costs are not yet available and disclosure of information at this time could lead to incorrect information being provided.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770422">Mr. Speaker, due to Alberta's unusually early wildfire season, which began on February 20, 2024, and was fueled by widespread drought conditions in 2024, there was not a period in which the prescriptions required for controlled ignition could take place. The elevated fire risk associated with these conditions made it unsafe and contrary to prescriptions required to carry out such operations. Prescriptions for fires have the following science-based considerations: wind speed, fuel moisture, drought code, landscape topography, barriers to fire spread and fuel type that is present, that is, what you are planning to burn and what is in the area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770423">Parks Canada utilizes a variety of wildfire management tools and strategies, including prescribed fires, forest thinning and the creation of community fire guards, to mitigate the impacts of wildfires and protect public safety, local communities and critical infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770424">A prescribed fire is a carefully planned and controlled fire ignited by trained fire management professionals. It mimics the low- to medium-intensity fires that naturally occur in ecosystems adapted to fire, helping to restore and maintain ecological health and biodiversity. Parks Canada employs prescribed fires as a vital tool to promote ecosystem conservation, reduce wildfire risks to surrounding communities and protect cultural heritage sites.</ParaText>

The office that Canadians have elected me to occupy is also in the Confederation building. On Tuesday, with the illegal protest that happened, which was assisted by three members of the NDP, the Confederation building was targeted because its ease of access outside the fences of West Block and Centre Block made it an easy target. Therefore, the NDP was complicit. I was unable to do my duties as a member of Parliament. I had a meeting scheduled that day with the ambassador from Israel in my office to discuss issues going on in the Middle East, and the ambassador cancelled the meeting because his security team felt threatened by this. </ParaText>

If they actually reviewed the procedural bible, on page 9374 of the Debates, they would see a ruling from June 13, 2012. The Speaker said to this point, “in the case of a question of privilege, the floor is not the members'.... The Speaker has the right to terminate [the] discussion if the Speaker feels that relevant points [to the question of privilege] that have not been previously raised have not been brought forward.” These are, more properly, debates for after your decision, and I would ask you to uphold the jurisprudence, the traditions of the House, and bring an end to this repetition by Conservatives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8770499">My concerns are regarding the protective policing program. I just want to put a few words on the record from the government's own documents: “The RCMP Protective Policing Program (PPP) is facing significant challenges meeting increased demand for their services, putting unsustainable pressure on the PPP program.” It also says, “Security and protection are of increasing concern due to a significant increase in the number of threats against public figures”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770500">I did feel responsible to ensure that the public safety aspect of this is put on the record, because we do not know who the individuals are. We do know who the NDP members are who were supporting them, but we do not know who the other members are. We walked to our offices and had individuals blocking our way. We do not know who they are, but their purpose was to block us from going into our offices. If we allow it to transpire that there could be sit-ins in our offices, I do believe it would raise considerable safety concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8770501">In particular, given the concerns raised by the government's own document, there is a reason we have the protective policing program in the first place. I cannot use props, but MPs are able to carry panic buttons for a reason—</ParaText>
