              <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Mr. Philip Lawrence (Northumberland—Peterborough South, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8777133">Mr. Speaker, before I start, I would like to wish everyone a merry Christmas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777134"> Today, we will talk about the SDTC and some of the actions that happened. It can be a bit technical, but in essence it is a horrendous but fairly simple scandal. It is involves the formation of an organization, a company on the behest of the government, and it had a laudable objective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777135">We are suffering through a productivity crisis. Our productivity is among the lowest of advanced economies. We would rank at the bottom probably in the G7 and as one of the lower performers in the OECD. Productivity sounds like working hard and all those good things, but that is not substantially what productivity gets a lift by. We can work as hard as we want, but if we do not have the appropriate innovation and technology, we simply will not get ahead as a company or, in this case, as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777136">This example is obviously an exaggeration but does well to show an example. If we are tasked with digging a hole, perhaps a foundation for a house or a building, and if our only technology is a shovel, we will be there for a long time. Even if we have the best workers in the world, we will not be able to compete with someone who has an excavator. Unfortunately, this is too often the case, granted that is exaggerated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777137"> Our machinery, our systems, our technology are often five, or 10 or 15 years behind most of our competition. One of the most significant competitors is right across the border, in the United States of America. Its equipment will often be five to 10 years, on average, younger than ours. If we have an older car, as I do, it does not operate as efficiently or as effectively as a brand-new car, or if it is an older refrigerator, it does not operate as well as a brand-new one. Since we are using older machinery and equipment, we are falling further and further behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777138">This brings me to the SDTC, which its laudable objective was to help cure this problem by stimulating the economy, by improving productivity through investments by the government, investments in the economy and in innovation particularly. The idea was that if we innovated, if we came up with some absolutely amazing ideas that we could grow into machinery, we could increase productivity. Productivity, when it is increased, affects nearly all of us. A rising tide lifts all boats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777139">The idea was to make some investments into these important innovations and technologies to help the Canadian economy and all Canadians. It is a laudable objective. In fact, past governments have even participated and agreed with this. There is some debate on whether a government can do this effectively or not. In this case, we really did not get the opportunity to see whether it could be effective or not. That was because instead of making those investments into equipment, technology and innovation that would help our economy, unfortunately, Liberal cronyism and corruption got the best of this organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777140">What happened was the government, with taxpayer dollars, funded $400 million. This is a fiduciary duty. The government was collecting from Canadians from coast to coast, taking that $400 million, putting it into a pot and giving these individuals, the members of the board of the SDTC, the responsibility of finding some of the best innovation to invest in so we can lift the entire standard of living for Canadians from coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777141">These people were given a tremendous responsibility, a real fiduciary responsibility. They were giving other people's money to invest on their behalf for the hopeful return of improving the standard of living for all. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth of what happened. We had $400 million, which were basically spent in corruption and given to Liberal insiders instead of actually helping innovation. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777142"> There are a number of different facets, including over $50 million given to ineligible contracts. This is just saying that what we are going to do is design a framework to give this $400 million away and in that framework, we are hopefully going to capture and design it well enough so that we are going to get those great companies, those great individuals who have those ideas that can help the productivity issue. They did come up with that framework. Then they decided to take $50 million and not put it within that framework, making it totally ineligible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777143">The most troubling part of this is that, of that $400 million, tens of millions of dollars were given away in conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest can sound a bit fancy, but what does that all mean?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777144"> Let us go back to that pot of money that was been gathered from coast to coast through income tax, sales tax and through the carbon tax. All of this money was taken, put into this pot and SDTC was given the responsibility to administrate and to award these monies. We have this $400 million and then we have this group of people who have to decide where that money goes. Unfortunately, tens of millions of dollars of that went to people who were supposed to objectively decide where that money would go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777145">In some cases, this is how it would work. There would be an application and then that application would come before these individuals who would be the arbiters of where that money would go. What would happen? One board of directors or one of the members would say that they had a conflict of interest. That is company A. Therefore, that individual would walk out of the room, all the while knowing that they would hear from an individual who had ownership or who had an interest in company B, which was next in line with an application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777146">We have an interest in company B and we are looking at the grant for company A, knowing full well that in the next half an hour, they are going to decide whether we get the money. The idea that this would not bias someone is just this side of absurd. Hundreds of millions of dollars have gone out the door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777147">It is important to note, and this is the part that is really under-reported and really not expressed enough, that this money does not come from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trust fund. That money does not emerge from ether. The is pulled from the hands of hard-working Canadians. It is taken from a single mom. In fact, a single mom earning $40,000 or $50,000 can face a marginal effective tax rate as high as 40%, 50%, even 60%. With the clawbacks and with income tax, that is absolutely what they pay. We can look it up at the Fraser Institute or we can look at C.D. Howe, which has written numerous papers on it. I trust the members to look at this and review it, because that is the reality of it. This money that is being taken from hard-working Canadians is then funnelled, in buckets full, to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777148">I want to give one example of where that $400 million could have been spent and where that $400 million could have done, in my estimation, a great deal of good. I have the privilege of being the shadow minister for transportation. In the last couple of transportation committee meetings, we have been discussing and studying the “big dock”. Not many of us will know what the “big dock” is and that is fine. The “big dock” is located in Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777149">There are two first nations groups and also Métis people that utilize the “big dock”, in addition to a rural municipality. The “big dock” is the centre of activity. It is where children learn to swim. It is often the time where children might throw in their first line to catch that fish. I can remember my son actually catching his first fish. It is such an exciting moment. This is the centre of community. Also, the only way people can get in and out of the community during the summer is through this big dock or wharf. At the transport committee, we learned that this dock and the vicinity was contaminated and that Transport Canada knew about this since 1997.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777150">Most recently, a report in 2017 said there were hydrocarbons, arsenic, and other heavy metals and contaminants that I certainly would not want my children, or anyone's children, to swim or play in. There are even older reports that show there is perhaps radiation surrounding this dock. Transport Canada knew about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777151">In the 2017 report, which there was an obligation under the environmental assessment to disclose, the government said it was looking at divesting this. It sent two out of the three indigenous groups this in a package of due diligence. It was a huge package. Those who have practised law know what due diligence can look like. It can be tens of thousands of documents at a time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777152">The Liberals, through Transport Canada, said it was good enough because they disclosed it. They did not disclose it. They kept it a secret. Since 2017, they knew it was contaminated. Worse, they had to be dragged kicking and screaming. We actually found out about it because the chiefs at the time realized the dock was actually getting covered as the water levels were declining, because sediment was building up around the dock. They needed to dredge it. It was not purely for recreation; as I said, it is the only way out of the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777153">When the wildfires struck the area, the communities had difficulty evacuating. They asked in 2023 and again in 2024 to have the area dredged. Transport Canada was reluctant. The communities did not know why, but they knew that if another wildfire hit, the people may not be able to get out. They might literally burn to death. They said, “We are going to do it, whether you want it or not.” What was the response from Transport Canada? “You will be put in jail. If you go ahead and dredge this, you will go to jail.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777154">The communities were then left in the terrible position of letting their people down by not dredging it, meaning the next wildfire could very well be the end of their people, or they could go to jail. They actually took what I thought was a brilliant course of action. They hired their own toxicologist. They wanted to find out what was going on. They found out a couple of things: first, it was contaminated; second, after the contamination was discovered, the government did not bother to study it for the effect on human health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777155">The Liberal government, through its agency Transport Canada, knew it was contaminated. The next logical step from a professional toxicologist was to look at the effect of that contamination on human health. Instead of doing that to find out if it would have an impact and what that impact would be, the communities decided to keep this as a commercial port, even though anyone who has been to the big dock would easily say it is much more than an area, a barge dock, where we ship off supplies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777156">The big dock is a community hub. This is where children swim and fish. The Liberals chose to turn a blind eye to this. That is what they did. It was not until the indigenous people chose to hire their own toxicologist that they found out about the contamination. Here we are now, still dragging the Liberals kicking and streaming. The communities asked for $25 million, which is a fair amount of money. Goodness sakes, for folks in my community, $25 million sounds like a lot of money. However, the government spent $400 million to achieve nothing but padding the pockets of Liberal insiders, and for less than 10% of that investment, we could have cleaned up and remediated the entire area around the big dock.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777157">The government could have built a brand new dock so there was an area for children to swim and fish in and enjoy again, an area where the first peoples, the Chipewyan nation, could evacuate effectively. It could have done that for less than 10% of what it wasted padding the pockets of Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777158"> I have been trying to speak to this in a way I hope most folks can understand when we hear the number $400 million. With the billions the government has spent, we do not know what the deficit is because it will not even tell us. Its public accounts are due by September at the very latest. We are now in December. We still do not know effectively what the deficit is. We will hear criticisms, mostly from that side of the aisle and the folks on the other side of the aisle who support them, that sometimes we ask questions that are too aggressive or even seem petty. However, I have heard the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> ask this completely substantial and reasonable question: What is the deficit? What type of government does not respond to that type of question six months after it is supposed to have published it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777159"> Do members know what would happen in a private business if a CEO refused to tell people what its losses, revenue and costs were for this long a time? I can tell them exactly what would happen. They would be fired and would go to jail. There is a duty on all of us, as it is not the government's money it is administering or negotiating; it is not the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s money. It is that of the people of Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Orono, Cramahe and Brighton, who work day in and day out for it. These are dollars they were hoping to utilize for their children's education. For many of them, their children's education is so far off that they just want to make sure their kids can eat at the end of the week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777160">Instead of that money going where it can best be spent by the people who earned it, it is sent here, to the ivory white towers, where these folks will tell them they know better. The Liberals will make sure those people do not just spend their money on beer and popcorn; rather, they will take that money and invest it for them because they know better. Well, we have clearly seen that they do not and that the money belongs in the hands of the hard-working people who earned it. It belongs in the hands of our indigenous communities. It belongs in the hands of our farmers, business owners and job creators, because they earned it, they value it and they know where best to spend it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777161">The next time members hear some story about this great Liberal program that is going to come out and revolutionize the world, I want them to think about the single mother who is putting water in the milk to make sure her child has enough to get through the end of the week. Is it worth taking another $20 or $30 from her for this great imaginary program that will never do anything but build bureaucracy? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777162">We need to return to being the freest country in the world. We need to return to being a country where everyone has opportunities, where it does not matter who they are or where they came from, but how hard they work, what they want to accomplish and who they want to be. </ParaText>

We both sit on the transport committee and he did a great job playing with the facts. He said we have turned a blind eye, but I would like to remind him that when the Conservatives, under Stephen Harper, found out about this contamination, they not only turned a blind eye but completely shut off their ears because they did not want to know anything about it. Moreover, they were ready to sell it. </ParaText>

The government benches have one solution: building bureaucracy. We have another solution: building houses. According to experts, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>'s plan of just removing the GST would create over 30,000 home builds. The more homes we build, the less houses cost and the more chances we have for folks to walk across that threshold and enjoy the dream of home ownership.</ParaText>

The member has a background of immense experience in supporting small business owners and understanding legal technicalities that impact businesses. One thing we have been hearing about is the administrative and compliance costs associated with how the government is going to be switching the rules around GST back and forth; this is going to create an immense burden for small business owners. Rather than our proposal for eliminating the carbon tax everywhere and for good, which is clear and simple, what the Liberals are doing imposes a major burden on small business owners. Would the member share a bit about that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777176">Mr. Speaker, I am just going to spend a little time quickly talking about efficiency and how an economy works. We can think of capitalism as the allocation of resources based on consumer demands; what consumers want, they will get through a system of purchases and otherwise. The more efficient that is, the more those goods get out effectively and the wealthier everyone is. Every time the government puts in a regulation, it makes the system less efficient. Some of the regulations the government puts in are needed, so members should not take me the wrong way. This means that there will be more money going to Ottawa and less money going to Canadians. Particularly where the regulations create temporary, short-term distortions, they can actually do a lot of permanent harm to the economy. This is because they disrupt the efficiency of the economy, and the buy-and-sell signals that exist in a capitalist economy are distorted. I would love to believe that this had a good intention, but I can almost guarantee that the outcome will be negative for most Canadians.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Mr. Alistair MacGregor (Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8777187">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be changing the channel on the Conservative speeches that the House has been stuck with for the last two months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777188">For the benefit of my constituents in the great riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, I will note that the House of Commons has been held up since the end of September because of an ongoing argument over a House order to produce documents from Sustainable Development Technology Canada. That order was made by the House back in June; of course, because the government has not complied with it, we are faced with a motion of privilege. Basically, a privilege motion is brought forward by any member who feels that their personal rights as an MP of the House or the rights of the House as a collectivity have been breached. In this case, it was brought forward by the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777189">The original motion that we are dealing with is very simple, and I will read it out for the record: “That the government's failure of fully providing documents, as ordered by the House on June 10, 2024, be hereby referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs”. The Conservatives, throughout the last couple of months, have been putting forward different variations of amendments and subamendments, but I will just stick to debate on the motion because I think that is an order with language that people can clearly understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777190"> On the face of it, it seems simple enough. The unfortunate thing is that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have found a way out of the mess that we are currently in. However, because both of these parties have abdicated their responsibility and are basically stuck in a playground fight with one another, all business of the House of Commons has come to a complete standstill. That is a problem. It costs a lot of money to run this place each and every day. We not only have the sitting members of Parliament, who are collecting their salaries, but we also have an extensive House of Commons administration, which is here to make sure that this place runs as smoothly as possible. I think Canadians would be quite full of regret if they were to see how their taxpayer dollars are being wasted in this frivolous debate, which has been going on for over two months now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777191">We have incredibly important bills and business of the House that could have been discussed, but instead, day after day, we are just treated to a litany of Conservative MPs, who keep on talking about the same old thing. However, I will say this for the record: I firmly believe that the House absolutely has a constitutionally protected right to send for persons and papers. The House can make an order, which is an important function of Parliament, to send for papers, and those papers could be documents of any kind, physical copies or electronic copies, but really the only limits are that they need to exist and they need to be within Canada. This is an unfettered right; it has been upheld again and again by the parliamentary counsel in rulings. Not only you, Mr. Speaker, but also previous occupants of the chair have reaffirmed that this right exists. Therefore, from the outset, I want to state clearly that I agree with the main thrust of what we are trying to achieve here, which is that the House wants to see all of those documents in their unredacted form. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777192">However, we are at an obvious impasse. The government is unwilling to budge, and the Conservatives are unwilling to stand down. As a result, we are not going anywhere in the House, and important issues in foreign affairs, economic policy, health policy and all the things that Canadians elected us as MPs to come here and deliberate about on their behalf are not getting dealt with. In fact, the only recourse we have as members of Parliament right now is to bring up the occasional concurrence debate on a committee report that has already been tabled. It is not much of a debate because, of course, those committees have already agreed to those reports by majority vote, and they have been duly tabled. Therefore, we are left with the only option of spending three hours here and three hours there debating a report that has already been deliberated in thoroughness at its respective committee. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777193">However, because that is the only avenue we have available to us, that is the only way that we have been able to bring forward important subjects on foreign affairs, on health, on economic policy and, again, on what Canadians are expecting us to do. As we are at an impasse, we have to look at this and try to be the adults in the room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777194"> I will remind people that the Conservatives are filibustering their own motion right now. The motion they have brought forward is to bring this matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. That is a very important committee. That committee not only determines the membership of other standing committees, but it deals with all of these really important issues. If the House is at an impasse, it falls to that committee to deliberate and find a way forward. If we were to arrive at a space where we could send this motion, again, a Conservative motion that they brought forward and are filibustering, if we could find some way to bring this to the procedure and House affairs committee, so that that committee could deliberate on the way forward, then it would allow this House of Commons to get back to the business of debating the issues that matter to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777195"> Now there are a few things I want to raise, because I have listened to Conservative speech after Conservative speech on this matter and it is unclear exactly what details they are looking for. On one hand, there are major problems with how this funding was allocated. The Auditor General observed that and the committee in its investigation observed that there were obviously major problems. Were they criminal? That is not for me to say. Obviously, there was some gross mishandling of taxpayer dollars and people absolutely need to be held accountable for that, but it is not up to us to determine whether this is a criminal matter. That falls on the independence of the RCMP and also our criminal prosecution services. They are the only ones who can decide whether this proceeds in a criminal way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777196">There have been some arguments back and forth on whether the House of Commons is within its rights to hand these documents over to the RCMP or whether that would constitute interference in an independent investigation. Again, this is not a question that I am best equipped to answer, nor the House as a collective body. I have repeatedly asked Conservative MPs after their speeches, because there is this uncertainty about what role the RCMP should play in this, if it would not be best to refer this to the PROC committee, call the commissioner of the RCMP forward as a witness and get best guidance from the top RCMP official in the land. I take this very seriously because at two standing committees I serve on, public safety and justice, I can say that I have dealt with this subject matter quite a bit. I have a lot of respect for the work that our police do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777197"> Again, in an effort to find a reasonable and adult way forward, could we not just break this impasse to find a way for the RCMP to appear at that committee to find a way forward? If the procedure and House affairs committee recommends a path forward, then if the House is still not satisfied, we can again continue this privilege debate. However, I think it is sincerely unfair that debating this now very frivolous motion has held up the business of the House for more than two months. I lay the blame equally on both the Conservatives and the Liberals. They have obviously been unable to find a way forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777198"> What I would say is that a lot of the Conservatives' speeches these days seem to have to fit several criteria, as set out by their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>: They have to be full of hyperbole, they have to fit on a bumper sticker and often they have to rhyme. I think we are lowering the quality of the debate that could be had in this place. I do not think this House as a whole is rising up to the expectations that Canadians have at this moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777199"> Over the last two and a half months, all I have been witness to, from both the Liberals and the Conservatives, has been Liberal and Conservative members pointing to each other saying they are not as bad as the other when they were in government. To borrow from Tommy Douglas's fable on Mouseland, it is like the mice are being asked to choose between the blue cats and the red cats. At the end of the day, they are all cats and they are all bad for mice. We are not in a good situation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777200"> We are in a cost of living crisis right now. I would much rather spend my time in this House talking about how, over the last 40 years of Conservative and Liberal governments, we have developed a culture in Ottawa that is full of corporate deference. We have seen our corporate tax rates slashed to one of the lowest in the G7. We have seen policies enacted by both Liberals and Conservatives that have allowed mergers and acquisitions to result in the concentrated corporate power we see in so many of our sectors right now, whether it is telecommunications, grocery retail, or even oil and gas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777201">We keep hearing arguments from the Liberals saying that they have done so much, and that we should look at what they have done and that ask why Canadians are not happy with what they have done. They are obviously missing the mark. They are out of tune. They are led by someone I once described as radioactive. I hope the Liberals understand that they are not going anywhere with the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> as their leader. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777202">However, the Conservatives are not doing any better because those bumper sticker slogans full of hyperbole and rhyming are just cheapening the debate. I do not see a very real offer coming from them, especially when their leader is fighting against a system in which he has been a member of Parliament for quite some time now. He was first elected in this place in 2004. I am the same age as the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservatives</Affiliation>, so when he was first elected, he was 25 years old. At that time, I was out in the wilds of British Columbia, breaking my back as a tree planter. For him to fight against the system that he is so clearly a part of and offer himself as something new is a complete and total joke. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777203">Let us face it. He gets his politics from the time he was Stephen Harper's favourite attack dog. I can say that it was people like him who inspired me to run in this place. I remember when I first saw the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> on TV and could not believe someone could be elected who was so arrogant, so full of spite and just downright nasty. It is quite obvious from the antics he displays here now that he has not changed his ways. I will always be inspired to run against that kind of politics and against the politics of the Liberals, who believe they are God's gift to Canada and wonder why everyone cannot just be happy with the incredible work they are doing. The Liberals have let people down. They are not doing enough. The Conservatives are going to bring in the exact same types of policies the Harper government was tossed out of office for in 2015, and that is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777204"> The other thing is that the Conservatives stand here and talk about affordability issues when we know the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has already started his fundraising circuit and is going to be frequented by the exact corporate executives who are jacking up prices everywhere and taking Canadians' hard-earned money. Many Canadians would agree with me that billionaires do not need more relief, the working class does, and yet, because of the corporate deference policies that we have seen from these two parties over 40 years, we are at the natural result of those policies. They are, number one, many corporate sectors have seen record profits and, number two, those record profits are happening at a time when Canadians are suffering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777205">It is not a hard stretch of the imagination to link the fact that in 2023, the corporate grocery retail, five companies that control 80% of the market combined, saw profits of over $6 billion. At the same time, we have a record number of Canadians having to visit food banks. The math is simple. I would agree with my friends that I would rather see the dollars in the pockets of my constituents, but it is not the government removing those dollars, it is corporate profits. More and more of Canadians' net incomes are being spent on the essentials of life: heating, fuel, transportation, housing and food. That is not the government's fault, it is the fault of corporations that have been unfairly jacking up prices. They are acting like a vacuum cleaner, sucking up the hard-earned net dollars of my constituents to pad CEO bonuses, stock buybacks and dividend payouts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777206"> It is a system that needs to be changed. It needs a wholesale cleanup, and we cannot trust the two parties that have built this system. It is not New Democrats, the Green Party or the Bloc Québécois. It is Liberal and Conservative federal governments trading places. Canadians need to realize these two parties, at their core, are but two sides of the same coin. They may quibble over the big partisan talking points of the day, but these two parties are two different sides of the same coin. They fundamentally believe in that neo-liberal economic policy, which over the last 40 years, especially since the greed of the 1980s, has led to deregulation, mergers, acquisitions and unrivalled corporate power that has put Canadians in the economic situation they are in today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777207">I want to talk briefly about some of the other things that have been held up. I will be personal here. I have a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11738234" Type="4">C-277</Document>, which was voted on unanimously by the House of Commons at second reading in May. It sailed through the Standing Committee on Health, with some minor amendments, but again, it was unanimously adopted by the Standing Committee on Health and reported back to the House. It is being held up by this filibuster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777208">There are even good Conservative bills that are being held up by this filibuster, some of the Conservatives' own legislation. There are some good bills from the government that, in those rare occurrences, we can find all-party agreement on, but we are again in a situation now where these are being held up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777209">Going back to my particular bill, the brain injury community has been without hope for a long time. Bill <Document DbId="11738234" Type="4">C-277</Document>, is designed to set up a national strategy on brain injuries. I have received compliments from Conservative and Liberal MPs across the political spectrum. They have told me that this is a good bill and this is what is needed. The brain injury community's hopes are being dashed right now because of this filibuster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777210">Just last week, because of the support this bill has, I sought unanimous consent to see it reported, go through report stage, through third reading and be sent off to the Senate. This was denied by the Conservatives. I have been trying to find ways we can get good legislation through this impasse, but we are at a stage right now, this last week of sitting, where the partisan emotions are so high that we are unable to see past each other's talking points, especially the Liberals and the Conservatives, to find a way to let good legislation go through. This is not only a shame on us as an institution, but it is a shame for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777211">With the new incoming Trump administration, the way Canadians are falling behind in the cost of living crisis and what we are going to do with the future of our foreign policy, it is a dangerous world out there. It is not good for Canadians within our borders. We are stuck in this stasis field of continuous filibustering, and the House is not living up to the expectations of Canadians. I urge my fellow parliamentarians to reach for the spirit of Christmas, if they need to, but we need to find a way to break this impasse. We need to find a way to live up to the expectations of our constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777212">I will conclude with the following. I fully agree with the unfettered right of the House of Commons to send for papers. The Liberals have some explaining to do. They need to answer why they are not releasing all of those documents and why some of those documents were redacted. However, I am not going to absolve the Conservatives of responsibility on this either. They are the ones who are putting up speaker after speaker. They are the ones who are preventing us from voting on their motion— </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777214"> Mr. Speaker, I am rising to provide additional information to you, as Speaker, on the deliberate matter of privilege that was raised on Friday morning by the Conservative deputy leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777215">As the <Affiliation DbId="278358" Type="2">Conservative deputy whip</Affiliation> said at the time, “a personal first-hand account is very much part of the information that the Speaker must hear.” Given that I was named by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>, it is only right that I be given the opportunity to respond. The member for Thornhill made a number of wildly misleading accusations of increasing seriousness and severity. She began by saying that the protesters at the Confederation Building lobby on Tuesday morning were organized and supported by me. The accusations grew into talk about NDP-organized protesters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777216">Her colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, spoke of NDP complicity and said that the “illegal protest” was assisted by me. In the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>'s intervention, she stated, in her third paragraph, “The demonstration started around 8:45 a.m. The protesters said they would allow MPs with offices in the building to pass through the crowd”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777217">I think it important to provide my own account, given that, on personal attacks being made or members' motives being maligned, the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, chapter 13, states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777220">I should share with you that, like all members on the Hill, at 8:45 a.m., I received a situation advisory update on my cellphone, which is customary. That identified a peaceful sit-in at the Confederation Building. That day, in fact, that entire week, we had our constituency assistants from across the country here in Ottawa for training. That is why my staff were with me on that particular day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777221">A press conference will bear out that I had the role of introducing our Speaker at a press conference shortly after this advisory was sent. At 8:45 a.m., while attending to my responsibilities at the Wellington Building, I did come across an action that was happening, with people in front of the Confederation Building who were demanding for an arms embargo and an end to the Israeli genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777222">Mr. Speaker, you may know this, and some members may know this, but I would doubt that many Conservatives would know this. As was witnessed last week, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party called a picket line a rally for striking workers. As Canada's only labour party, we have a long-held tradition of not crossing picket lines. We view this action in the lobby of Confederation to be very much in keeping with a picket line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777223">While the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> was correct that this was an action of maybe a hundred, and the member said that it was perhaps 130, people, led by many Jews against genocide, to suggest that this was somehow an NDP-organized action does not just denigrate the spirit of our parliamentary privileges but also takes away the agency of the tens of thousands of progressive Jews against genocide, and the agency of those who took it upon themselves, as referenced by the member for Thornhill, to be present in the lobby. They would allow people to pass, provided that they heard the message.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777224"> I rise on this question of privilege because the hypocrisy coming out of the Conservative caucus would be laughable if it were not so offensive. The actions here between January 22 and February 23, 2022, known as the convoy, shut down this entire precinct's operations, not for 45 minutes, as this action did, but for an entire month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777225">As is tradition with New Democrats attending picket lines, I went inside the Confederation Building. I stood in the corridor of the doorway so as to not cross what I considered an action demanding MPs to hear the voices of the 100-plus progressive Jews against genocide. I would like to report to the House what I did hear. I heard a call for a motion passed sometime back in March on an opposition day for a full embargo, calls for an end to the genocide and a beautiful expression of Judaism with the blowing of the shofar, the recitation of the Torah and the singing of songs in the Jewish tradition that go back to time immemorial in solidarity with basic notions of justice and peace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777226"> Evidence will show that, through a video that was posted, when I arrived, I was confronted by a PPS officer at the door. I immediately identified myself as a member of Parliament. Despite the wildly inaccurate accusations by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>, I actually stated in that video exchange, which you can certainly take into your consideration, that I was there to bear witness. I was there to observe what was happening with those citizens, Jewish people of conscience who want to end the genocide and are calling for the arms embargo. I also witnessed a highly organized liaison process between PPS and the organizers. PPS, I think, given the sheer number of people, accorded itself in a very professional way to negotiate the protesters' peaceful removal and retreat from the Confederation Building, which did happen and was also recorded on video. Their own organizers said that they were slowly going to leave and that they were going to retreat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777227">It should be noted that, in comparison, if this is what we are doing here today, photos from the convoy include the former Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>; the member for <Affiliation DbId="278203" Type="2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</Affiliation>; the member for <Affiliation DbId="278182" Type="2">Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan</Affiliation>; and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278477" Type="2">Saskatoon—Grasswood</Affiliation>. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> was in a photo with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278498" Type="2">Miramichi—Grand Lake</Affiliation> and convoy supporters. This week, we will finally be tabling the final report on the Emergencies Act review, but it was the OPP that compiled a report on February 6, 2022, more than a week after the Conservative-supported convoy demonstrators first arrived in the national capital region, that became evidence to the public inquiry on the Emergencies Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777228">The vexatious comments made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> are trying to impugn the NDP for standing up and bearing witness to what was otherwise a very brief and beautiful act of what, perhaps, could be called civil disobedience there in the lobby, which will be borne out by whatever processes take place. However, a very quickly negotiated retreat happened well before most people would be coming and going from the building. I can say that I quite readily watched PPS escort many MPs in and out of that particular building. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777229">As we can see, the accusations that we somehow organized this protest to intentionally disrupt or obstruct Conservative members from participating in Parliament are completely fabricated and misleading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777230">However, the Conservatives did not stop there. They could not help themselves from linking this protest to “mobs [that] target Jewish neighbourhoods, firebomb Jewish schools, obstruct synagogues and wreak havoc”. This is a shameful way to characterize Jewish people of this country in their civil disobedience to genocide. To characterize Jewish people in this way, in my estimation, is a form of anti-Semitism, and it is a disgusting allegation to make. To liken a group of Jewish protesters to anti-Semitic mobs is beneath contempt. Linking members of Parliament, by extension, to such disgusting acts itself can be considered a form of a prime facie breach of our privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777231">Those are my remarks. I am glad that I had an opportunity to finally put that on the record and clear the air on this particular matter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777232"> Mr. Speaker, I also would like to take a moment to share some of my thoughts on the matter of privilege which was raised on Friday morning by the Conservative Party deputy leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>. As the <Affiliation DbId="278358" Type="2">Conservative deputy whip</Affiliation> said at the time, “a personal first-hand account is very much part of the information that the Speaker must [have]” to make a decision on the matter, and I would like the opportunity to be able to respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777233">It is up to the Speaker to determine whether the action amounted to a violation of privilege of the individual member. I want to make it very clear that, from my perspective, for my part, I did not experience any violation of my privilege as a member of Parliament. I was able to access my office without problem, using the entrance. I was able to have my scheduled meetings in my office without any interruption, and my staff were also able to access their office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777234"> I will say that the meeting I had that day had nothing to do with what was happening in the foyer. I was able, with my staff, to get to my office. My guest was able to access my office and we were able to have our meeting. Then my guest was actually able to leave as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777235"> I want to challenge some of what was said by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> and her Conservative colleagues as they made extreme and misleading allegations that impugned me and my colleagues. She suggested that the action was “aided by New Democrat MPs”, that it was “NDP-organized” and that NDP MPs were “part of this protest, in an effort to impede and obstruct the work of fellow parliamentarians”. Frankly, that is just completely false. I had no knowledge of the protest action; I learned about it from the PPS email that was sent to all members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777236"> I did stop to listen to the protesters on my way in and out of the building, which is where my colleagues and I were photographed listening. This is part of our job. I am not from Israel. I am not from Palestine. I am not Jewish. I am not Muslim. I am not Arab. I require the perspectives of other people to inform the decisions I make as a member of Parliament. Frankly, for me, being in the Confederation Building and seeing people standing up against a genocide happening against children was a moment I will remember for a very long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777237"> It is part of our job to listen. It is part of our job to understand what is being said by Canadians. I understand that the protest action was organized by a coalition called Jews Say No To Genocide. Something that I have noted that none of the Conservatives have raised is that the issue the protesters, many of whom were Jewish Canadian, were speaking out against is a genocide that has been identified as happening in Gaza and in which Canada has complicity, particularly in arms transfers to Israel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777238"> The protesters were saying, “not in our name”. It is well known that New Democrats are deeply upset with the Canadian government's position and Canada's complicity in the genocide. However, whether or not a parliamentarian agrees with the argument, or whether they are uncomfortable or comfortable with the argument, is irrelevant to the question of privilege. For my part, I believe it is important to hear from Canadians, given the tens of thousands of people who have been killed, especially children, with Canadians' tacit support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777239">This is why I stopped to give a few minutes of my time to the group. However, to suggest that NDP MPs organized or were part of the protest is entirely false. For my part, I saw a peaceful and very short sit-in. I heard singing. I heard a rabbi speaking to the group about peace. I heard peaceful calls for Canada to end its complicity in a genocide. I believe that the protest action was over within an hour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777240">It was very, very different from some of the protests on Parliament Hill that have lasted for weeks and weeks, the same protests in which white supremacy symbols were shown and the same protests that my racialized staff had to cross to get to my office. However, that does not have to do with the current question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777241"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> stated, “It is not only my privilege that is breached, but it is everybody who has an office in the Confederation Building and those who try to access the parliamentary precinct.” I disagree. As I mentioned earlier, I had a meeting in my office in the Confederation Building for an unrelated issue, and I got in and out of the building with great ease, as did my guest and my staff. My parliamentary work was unobstructed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777242">For my part, PPS staff were helpful in ensuring that my colleagues and I got to work without a problem. I would like to take a moment to thank them for the work they do and for their professionalism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777243"> I do want to give additional information for you to consider, Mr. Speaker, in response to the speeches made by Conservative members on Friday. First, the term “occupation” was used. It was not an occupation by any means; it was a peaceful and very short sit-in. I want to give some new information on the context of the action, as the Conservatives' choice of words is really very misleading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777244"> Peaceful sit-ins are a common feature of peace movements and civil rights movements. From the Woolworth's lunch counter protests during the civil rights era to women's suffrage movements and peace movements, peaceful sit-ins are a standard tactic of non-violent protest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777245"> In July, 400 people with Jewish Voice for Peace held a sit-in in the atrium of the United States Congress to protest the United States' support for the genocide in Gaza. There was a similar sit-in protest last year at the Alberta legislature, without incident, again protesting Canada's complicity in the horror in Gaza. At the legislature in Texas, there have been a number of peaceful sit-ins over recent years on issues ranging from sanctuary cities to human rights. Other provincial and state legislatures have also had sit-in protests on a range of social justice issues. All of these people have been continuing the non-violent tradition of temporarily taking up public space to protest injustice, and Canadians certainly have the right to protest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777246"> The issue, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, is not the merits of the protest at the Confederation Building and what it is called, but whether it infringed on the individual member's privilege. To this I would say again that the second access to the building was open, and I personally had no challenges or issues whatsoever accessing my office. A protest's making members uncomfortable is not the same as impeding their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777247"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278203" Type="2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</Affiliation> said she felt unsafe, but feeling unsafe is not the same as being unsafe. What I saw was a peaceful protest with singing, with chanting in Hebrew, and with seniors and young people united together. I do not quite understand how a person could see this group, which included a rabbi and elders, and feel unsafe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777248">One might feel uncomfortable maybe, because it should make any person question their thinking about a genocide. We should all feel uncomfortable about our country's complicity in the killing and maiming of children in Gaza, but we should not feel unsafe. It is a case where MPs could have taken a minute to listen to protesters' concerns and hear these Canadians out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777249"> Finally, we want to address a comment by the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> that I find especially troubling: “This is also a continuation of the very tactics that we have seen on our streets from unhinged mobs that think that their petty grievances allow them to target Jewish neighbourhoods, firebomb Jewish schools, obstruct synagogues and wreak havoc on our Canadian values, while abiding and abetting groups that are designated as terrorists in this country.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777250"> There is no question that incidents of anti-Semitism have increased in Canada, and this must be condemned by every member of Parliament in the House. Like all Canadians, Jewish Canadians deserve the right to feel safe in their communities, but the protest was led by Jewish Canadians who are advocating for peace, for human rights and for Canada to uphold its obligations under international law. To suggest that these Jewish Canadians are responsible for anti-Semitic attacks is, in my view, deeply offensive. To suggest that the protesters are part of an “unhinged” mob with “petty grievances” is offensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777251">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> can disagree with the protesters, but to insult these people who are protesting the killing of children, the maiming of children and the starving of children is wrong. To suggest that these Jewish protesters who called for peace are aiding terrorism is offensive, and I would ask the member to consider withdrawing the comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777252">The protest that happened last Tuesday was a peaceful sit-in. As parliamentarians, we have an obligation to listen to Canadians. As parliamentarians and legislators, we should be doing everything we can to amplify their voices. I would like that to be considered as part of the deliberations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777268">Today we are here, once again, to discuss the economic vandalism of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal-NDP partners and what they have inflicted upon Canadians. Nowhere is that vandalism clearer than in the housing crisis today in this country. All we have to do is look at a real estate listing or talk to someone with a mortgage to realize that, after nine years of the government, the dream of home ownership in this country is simply dead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777269">My parents came to this country looking for opportunity and they found it. They worked hard. They made countless sacrifices. They saved up. They were eventually able to buy a home for about $150,000 in the place that I grew up, in Thornhill. That was on a taxi driver's salary. Today, a house in that same neighbourhood is selling for close to $2 million, but one could get a deal at $1.5 million, a more than tenfold increase. I can assure members now that taxi drivers, small business owners and nearly everyone else who works for a living is not earning a tenfold increase in salary to match that tenfold increase in housing prices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777270">Because my parents had an affordable place to live in a safe neighbourhood, they could raise a family. They could start a business. They could live the life they dreamed of after fleeing one that we would never know. That dream is being cruelly taken away from too many in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777271">In Toronto, it used to take 25 years to pay off a mortgage. Now it could take more than 30 years to save up for a down payment. The average salary needed to afford the average home in this city is $263,300. That is not a mansion or a palace, but an average home, a bungalow, in a place like Scarborough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777272">Who makes $263,000 a year? It is certainly not most people in Toronto, where the average salary is $60,000 a year. It is certainly not a new immigrant to this country who is coming here to look for a fresh start and to forge new horizons. It is certainly not new graduates, looking for a place to start their careers and thinking that maybe they will be able to start a family. It is not even a parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777273">The Liberals have made this country so unaffordable that even their own MPs could not afford a home in the place where they came from or in our nation's capital. That is not a knock on them, but a reality that their boss has inflicted upon Canadians right across the country. That is not just in Toronto. It is in Brampton, where home prices are up 139% in just 10 years, in Burlington, where they are up 101%, and in rural places like Prince Edward County, where prices are up 211%. In fact, 24 out of 28 areas in Ontario, as defined by the Canadian Real Estate Association, have seen price increases over 100% in the last 10 years alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777274">I also want to tell members that it is not just in Ontario. In Prince Edward Island, housing prices are up 137% right across the province. In British Columbia, they are up 90%. Even in Quebec, which used to have some of the country's most affordable homes, they are up 81%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777275">Actions have consequences and the Liberal-NDP government is certainly finding that out now as the results of its economic vandalism become clearer and clearer. This is what happens when we pump a half-a-trillion dollars of inflationary spending into the Canadian economy, disproportionately benefiting asset holders and not the people who are looking for somewhere to call home. This is what happens when we ship billions of dollars off to municipalities with no strings attached to how that money is used or what it goes to. The government sent $471 million to Toronto, but since then housing starts are down 40% and, get this, development charges are up 42%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777276">That is what happens when our immigration system is broken by a government that cannot do the simple math. In 2022, we accepted 437,000 new citizens and 607,000 permanent residents, but we only built 219,000 new homes. Anybody who would do the basic math on this could have anticipated what would happen next.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777277">However, the Minister of Immigration at the time did not. In fact, he ignored the recommendations from his own department that warned about a housing shortage. This guy is now the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation>. The man who helped break the immigration system, in addition to losing track of all of the people that he let in, is now responsible for fixing housing in this country. It is going exactly how we might expect. Housing prices continue to rise and housing starts continue to go down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777278">We know the Liberals try to distract Canadians with what is happening in other countries as a way to somehow minimize the valid concerns of the people in our own country, so let us talk about some of these foreign countries for just a moment. Housing in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal was deemed much more unaffordable than cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York. Toronto and Vancouver were also deemed “impossibly unaffordable” when compared to Australia, China, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777279">What do we do about all of this? The Liberal answer is to continue to keep funnelling money into an accelerator fund that has built exactly zero homes and to keep shovelling cash into the infrastructure bank, which has completed exactly the same number of projects. They are doubling down on the same approach that got us here and are not willing or are unable to make new housing available while, at the same time, continuing to mess with the immigration system, a mess that has the weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> staring down the barrel of a 25%-tariff threat from the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777280">Common-sense Conservatives have a different approach. We are going to cut the GST on new housing construction so it is cheaper, not more expensive, to build the units Canadians need. We are going to make life more affordable by increasing the supply and availability of places to live from coast to coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777281">The current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation> loves the photo ops. Most of his job is big, fancy photo ops but no meaningful results, because we cannot argue with the facts. We are going to quit the photo ops and the posturing and replace them with actual negotiation that ties the number of infrastructure dollars that cities receive to the number of homes they build. We will make sure that high-density housing gets built near critical infrastructure like public transit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777282">It is a common-sense approach. What we incentivize, we get. The government incentivizes inaction and delay, and that is what they are getting. We will incentivize results for Canadians so they can achieve the dream of home ownership. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777283">Even Liberals approve of the plan, Liberals like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s adviser, Mike Moffatt, who called it “bold”. He said he was a big fan of the idea. He knows that it is time for real action, as do most other Canadians. It seems like everyone except the ones who sit on the other side of the House know exactly what the solution is. Conservatives are going to axe the tax, build homes and finally bring home a country where hard work pays off once again and where affordable housing gives way to that Canadian dream. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777284">There is much more I can talk about. I could go on about the lowest projected growth among advanced economies, the 1.5 million Canadians seeking work who cannot find it, the rapid growth of our bureaucracy and the red tape here in Ottawa, the impending quadrupling of a carbon tax that will delete more than $30 billion from our GDP or the new capital gains tax, which will send all that money down south. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777285">I could go on and on. Unfortunately, I will run out of time. I would much rather have four years to come up with the solutions to address the problems created by the Liberals and the NDP instead of the 10 minutes that this debate affords. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777286">All Canadians needed a carbon tax election yesterday, which is what we are hearing right across the country, so we can have a common-sense Conservative majority government led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, who will fix this mess, axe the tax, build homes, fix the budget and stop crime. It is within our reach. We are going to build homes that Canadians can actually afford. We are going to bring it home after the next election, after we have a Conservative majority government in this place, led by the member for Carleton. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777305">Madam Speaker, we just learned that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> will finally present her economic statement on December 16. This will be the first time in the history of our country that the fall economic statement is presented so late. The government dragged its feet because it wants to avoid revealing that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is weak and has lost control of spending, deficits, taxes and the cost of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777306">We have one message. We are asking for only one thing in this economic statement. We want the government to stop its inflationary spending that is driving up the cost of living, stop its job-killing tax hikes, stop putting Canadians in debt and stop threatening our social programs by making irresponsible decisions. That is what the Conservatives are asking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777307">We rise today to call on the government to eliminate the taxes on houses and condos. The bulk of housing costs for Canadians are not incurred to pay carpenters, materials or land. It is the taxes and red tape from all three levels of government that increase housing costs and make it impossible for young people to purchase a home. That is why common-sense Conservatives will get rid of the GST on new homes and save Quebec families up to $50,000 when they buy a nice home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777308">This is where we differ from the other parties. They believe that the government should take the money and give it to next level of government, which would give it to yet another level of government, which would, in turn, give it to the bureaucrats, who, in the end, would approve the housing. We feel that there is a faster route between two points, and that is a straight line. That is why we propose putting the money straight into the pockets of homebuyers by lowering their taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777309">Based on the data published by the government about the GST exemption for rental property, we estimate that our proposed measure would help build 30,000 more homes per year. Lower taxes on housing means more home construction. This is the solution that will really deliver results for ordinary Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777310">The part I am most proud of is that we will do away with the housing accelerator fund, because this program actually slows down the construction of housing. I am very proud to announce that we will eliminate this program and save the $8 billion the Liberal government is planning to pump into it, because this Liberal program will only increase bureaucracy and give more money to greedy politicians. I find it a bit pathetic that the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> is calling mayors to tell them he has sent them big cheques. He is telling them they must send a letter asking for his program to remain in place, even though it has slowed down housing construction. Obviously, these politicians are agreeing to this because they want taxpayer money. Politicians want money, but we are not here to work for other politicians. We are here to work for taxpayers and for young people who want to buy a home. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777311">That is why I will be very proud to cut these programs. That is not because these programs do not help. It would be incorrect to say that, because, in fact, the programs actually cause harm. Every time that bureaucracies receive money, the problem is not that they do not help. The problem is that they cause harm. Multi-layered bureaucracies prevent the building of new homes. We know this because, in the past 20 years, municipal revenues have ballooned twice as fast as inflation and population growth combined. If giving more money to municipalities was enough to speed up the construction of affordable homes, we would have the most affordable housing in the world. That is not the solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777312">The solution is to get rid of the bureaucracy, cut taxes and leave money in the pockets of the people actually doing the building and buying the homes. That is what we intend to do by cutting the GST on new homes sold, which will help every Canadian family save up to $50,000.</ParaText>

She calls it a “fall update”. Santa Claus will already have been preparing to lift off from the North Pole and the snow will have been falling. The leaves have long disappeared into the earth, they have disintegrated and biodegraded because it has been so long since those leaves fell, yet we are waiting until December 16 because she wants to hide that the weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has lost control of deficits, spending and our economy. We will see if she keeps her solemn commitment to a $40-billion deficit or if that promise will also go by the wayside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777314">That is why we have only one request: stop, just stop, in the name of God. The Liberals can stop the inflationary spending, stop doubling debt and stop driving up taxes on starving Canadians. They can stop everything they are doing until we have a carbon tax election, at which time common-sense Conservatives can axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Also, they can stop taxing new homes. That is why common-sense Conservatives are proposing to get rid of the GST on new homes to save up to $50,000 on a home for a young family trying to start out. After the Liberal government doubled the cost, it is the least we could do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777315">Liberals would rather have the money go to bureaucrats. They believe in trickle-down government. They take from the people and give it to one government, which gives it to another government that gives it to a third government that gives it to some bureaucrats. These bureaucrats, apparently, are going to start shuffling papers more quickly to eventually approve some homes. It is not that the housing accelerator program, which I plan, with delight, to get rid of, has not helped; it is that it has made the problem so much worse. When more money is given to bureaucrats, it is not that they do not do helpful things; it is that they stand in the way and cause even more harm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777316">One developer said just the other day, “Over the last 10 years, the list of application requirements has increased exponentially, and so has the number of bureaucrats looking at your application. And there’s often a pattern of staff waiting till the last day — say on Day 29 of 30 — they write back with a comment (pertaining to) something minor, which triggers another cycle. Imagine three or four such review cycles.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777317">The more of these bureaucrats, the more layers and the more delay. By getting rid of this program alone and doing nothing else, we will speed up housing construction. Yes, there will be greedy, fat-cat, big-city politicians who will whine and complain because they had expected to have that money to build their empires. My message to them is, “Go on whining and complaining because I am not here to build your empire. I am here to build homes for Canadians.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777318">That will be the choice in a housing tax election: either the NDP-Liberals, who fund local bureaucracies, or common-sense Conservatives, who axe the tax to build the homes. </ParaText>

We know that because since he became the MP, housing costs have doubled in Saint John. He was not able to get the Energy East pipeline approved. He squeals away that he does not like the carbon tax but then votes to quadruple that same tax. I do not know if that is duplicity or incompetence, but it is probably a combination of the two.</ParaText>

He said to do away with this idea of axing the GST on new homes and just give him the money. Every time someone buys a home in Aurora, the GST would go to the mayor instead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777323">If that was going to help build homes, it already would have. His revenues are up 192% while population growth and inflation have been 62% in the last 15 years. What has that done? It has driven up housing costs. We need less money for politicians and fewer taxes for home buyers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777334">Madam Speaker, I am glad we are having a debate on a substantive motion, and I will talk a little more about it. I will be splitting my time on this important issue with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777335">I am glad we are having a debate on the substantive issue of how we build more homes in Canada. We have that challenge because of the fact that Canada is growing in size. We are at 40 million people, and it is a good thing that we are growing as a country. We have an aging population and we need to ensure that we have more young people who are working and are able to populate our country from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777336">However, that comes with challenges on the infrastructure. We obviously have to keep pace with the growing population. We have to build more homes. We have to build more roads and public transit. We need to ensure that the infrastructure necessary to serve these homes, like water and sewer and electricity, is there as well. Of course, all of it costs money and it takes time to build.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777337"> How we go about doing that is a really important question. That is what we are debating through this opposition day motion. I will put aside all the name-calling and the personal insults, which is beneath this place and beneath all of us. I want to give credit where credit is due. For the very first time, the Conservative Party, on this substantive issue, has put forward a policy idea. Whether we agree or disagree is obviously up to all of us. However, I am glad to see that the Conservatives have put forward the idea of eliminating GST from home purchases under a million dollars. This idea merits a debate, but from my perspective, it is really not going to help build more homes. Therefore, I will be voting against this motion, and I will lay out my reasons for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777338"> As I see it, what is being proposed is basically to cut 5% of the GST from all new homes that are being built at a million dollars or less. According to the Conservative math that would save about $5,000, but it does not create any incentive whatsoever to build more homes, whether they are homes are to own or to rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777339"> It definitely does not create any incentive whatsoever to build homes that are affordable for people who are not able to rent or own a home and who need some sort of subsidy or support to have a roof over their heads. That particular element is missing. In fact, what we have just heard from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is that the Conservatives would cancel all existing programs, all kinds of existing supports and funding that would help build affordable homes across the country. In a very quick moment, I will speak to affordable housing that is being built in my community of Ottawa Centre alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777340"> The Conservative proposal would basically cut the GST and at the same time cut all programs that allow municipalities to build the necessary infrastructure like water, sewer and electricity, all those things that are necessary to then ensure that people can live in these homes. It is hard to make a house a home without plumbing or electricity. That is a very significant challenge. This is why we are seeing other levels of government, provinces and municipalities, which play a bigger role in building homes, opposing the Conservative idea. They do not support it because they see the challenges it would cause. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777341">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> can make it all about how he does not want to support politicians creating empires, etc, but he, as we know, has no experience in building anything. When he was the minister of housing, I think he was able to build six affordable homes, and that is not a record of which to be extremely proud.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777342">However, if we talk to mayors like here in the City of Ottawa, who are responsible for the rules and all the work that happens to build homes, they will tell me that a simple cut in the GST is not sufficient to build the kinds of homes we need. If it were sufficient, this idea would have been implemented some time ago. This it not to mention the hypocrisy we are seeing from the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777343">The member from the Bloc mentioned earlier that when we as a government brought in getting rid of GST from purpose-built rentals, the Conservatives voted against that idea. Therefore, they cannot be speaking out of both sides of their mouths. On one hand, they thought that was not good enough, that we should not be cutting GST from purpose-built rental. Now they think that they have the best idea in place and that everybody should align behind it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777344">We are trying to do a mix of both those ideas. On one hand, we have cut GST from purpose-built rentals so that we can induce more building of rental properties, and we are seeing the result of that. We are seeing rent coming down across the country. At the same time, we are creating incentives for municipalities to build more homes, and that is the essence of the housing accelerator fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777345"> We have done two things through that fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777346"> First, we have been using the money to build more affordable housing in our communities and municipalities. We know that about 15 or 16 Conservative MPs have lobbied the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> over time. I can give the full list, if anyone wants me to, but I do not want to take away from my important time. Those members have written letters to the Minister of Housing asking that money be given to their municipalities, because they need those dollars to build more affordable housing in their respective communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777347">In Ottawa, for example, if we look at my community of Ottawa Centre, we see affordable housing being built at Rochester Heights, which is maybe a 10-minute drive from here. We are seeing a whole new village being build, the Gladstone Village. We are starting to develop it, and it is being supported through the housing accelerator fund. Most recently, we made an announcement at LeBreton Flats called Dream LeBreton Flats, with the Multifaith Housing Initiative, where affordable housing along with for-profit housing will be built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777348"> In my riding alone, we are talking 1,000 affordable units that are starting to be built because of the housing accelerator fund. That would have not happened without the fund. These are homes for real people, people who can afford market rent and people who cannot afford market rent. These people will be able to call downtown Ottawa their home. However, that would have not have happened if we had not given $176 million to the City of Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777349"> The second thing we are doing through the housing accelerator fund is saying to cities and municipalities that if they want that money, they need to change their rules to allow for more density. They need to get rid of rules that say, “Not in my backyard.” We need for them to allow for at least four units per lot, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777350">We are the federal government, so we do not have any authority. The provinces have the authority to change their planning acts. As the federal government, we do not have any authority to change municipal rules as to how much housing they should allow for. However, through the housing accelerator fund, we have created that incentive for municipalities to change the rules to allow for more density. That is exactly what we are seeing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777351"> Not only are we able to build more affordable homes, but we there are for developers. Builders and developers like more density, so we have required municipalities to change their rules so that they can create and build more housing. That is smart policy. That is why the approach we have put forward is paying dividends. We are starting to see more housing starts as a result. We are starting to see more affordable housing being built as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777352"> The solution that is being put forward is worthy of debate. I am glad that the Conservatives have finally put an idea together, but it will not solve the problem of housing. It is a great slogan. It is great for the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> to give fiery speeches and do his really bad acting, and he needs to get some lessons, but it is will not build the kind of housing nor the magnitude of housing we need. For that reason, I will be voting against the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777353">Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the parliamentary secretary. He told a much different story than what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> had to say. The Leader of the Opposition is being very accusatory, saying that bureaucracy and red tape at city halls are preventing building from occurring, and nobody is really denying that. He gave the example of a developer and a planning application being be reviewed and then reviewed again. Nobody is denying that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777354"> We are saying that the housing accelerator fund is specifically designed. I know that in Kingston, the money that was given to the municipality was tied to reducing that red tape to ensure that more houses would get built quicker and to reduce exactly those kinds of problems that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> indicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777355"> I am wonder if the parliamentary secretary can provide some of his thoughts on that, and why it is so important. More important, over 15 Conservatives want this and have been advocating for this money for their ridings. Clearly, the Conservatives must see that it works. At least, the correspondence that they sent to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> indicated that they thought the money would work for the intended purpose. Otherwise, why would they be asking for it?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777356"> Mr. Speaker, the member for Kingston and the Islands is absolutely right, and he cited Kingston as an example. I can cite Ottawa as an example. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, the member for Carleton, and I share the same city as home. I wonder whether he has spoken with our mayor, Mark Sutcliffe, about this issue and what the mayor's response would be. A very small part of the money that we have given is going toward streamlining the entire process for approving projects, which builders and developers want. They want a simpler process. We are able to use that money to create that incentive to change the bylaws to build more density, so not just one house goes up but up to four houses go up by default, as well as even higher density on bigger sites, so builders can leverage the infrastructure that is available. Then a larger proportion of that money is going toward building affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777357"> That is the point. We are able to accomplish both. What the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> would be doing, essentially, by cutting the GST only is raising the margin of profit for developers because they would not pass those savings to the consumers.</ParaText>

We would knock on the door, and people would say they were worried that they would not be able to actually sell their home.

There has been a growth and an interest from people who want to live in rural Nova Scotia and, I would say, also rural Atlantic Canada. Particularly during the height of the pandemic and afterward, we saw large migrations across Canada. People from Ontario and western Canada wanted to come live in Nova Scotia for the quality of life our communities offer. This is a very good thing because, for years, our province has been chasing, desiring and wanting to welcome newcomers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777372">It may sound like a very modest number, but we just eclipsed a million people about a year and a half ago in our province. This was a number that came after projections showed that our population was going to decrease. As Nova Scotians, we should be welcoming the fact that people want to live in our communities. I live in East Hants, one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777373">At the same time, we need to make sure that we have the proper housing, infrastructure and social services to keep pace. This is what the conversation is about today. The Conservatives have put on the table a suggestion that the government should move forward with a GST cut for newbuild homes in the country up to a million dollars. I will be honest; in and of itself, that idea is not a terrible one. The catch is the fine print that the Conservatives do not put in the opposition day motion, which they have said outside this place. That is the way they would go about paying for that type of expenditure, which would be to cut the programs that are driving supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777374">It is extremely important for Canadians at home to understand that, when we rob Peter to pay Paul, that is not getting us any further ahead. In fact, it is actually narrowing the portion of Canadians who could benefit from a housing initiative. I am one of the younger members of Parliament in the House. There are a lot of people in my age bracket who are looking to buy their first home, looking to get in and start a family. They may not be in a position to purchase a brand new, just-built home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777375">One thing I have not heard the Conservatives address so far in the debate is why we are going so narrow on just newly built homes. Why is this not an affordability measure that is extended all the way across? Why are they proposing to get rid of the programs that are increasing supply, which could help support this initiative in the first place? By stunting the ability to build the supply, they are narrowing the benefit they would even be offering as part of their public policy choice to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777376">First and foremost, the Conservatives have to be clear on why they are cutting the programs that are important for the supply that is needed. We have heard premiers and, frankly, all members of Parliament on all sides of the House say that we need more supply in this country. I agree. Why are we taking away the programs that are giving us just that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777377">This gives us an opportunity to examine the programs the government has put out. I am not the housing minister, but I would suggest that the government has four different cadres of initiatives. We have put out support directly to developers to build, whether that is in very low-cost financing for developers to be able to build either new homes or new rental units, or whether it is in money given directly to the provinces to support public housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777378">Part of the reason we are in this situation is that, for 35 years, starting with the Chrétien government, there was an exodus of federal involvement in social and public housing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Chrétien. His government was good for this country. However, it is the current government that has sought to actually return these things. These things do not turn around overnight. This is part of the reason we find ourselves in the situation that we do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777379"> The third element is working directly with municipalities, whether that is providing the infrastructure needed for housing or putting money on the table that is tied to incentives. We have heard a lot that the Conservatives want to sit down and negotiate with the municipalities and withhold federal funding. On the positive side of the stick, that is exactly what the government is doing. It is sitting down with municipalities and putting in funding that is conditional on homes getting built in their local area. It is not pulling back federal funding if they do not hit a 15% target. I will get into more of what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>'s plan entails; experts have said that it would build less housing in this country, not more, and it is actually a very benign policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777380">Finally, we are also working directly with the people who would buy the homes, primarily young Canadians, via the first home savings account. There are a number of initiatives to try to help support young Canadians in getting into a home, with ways they can save up tax-free to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777381">What is the evidence of our plan working? In Nova Scotia, we have good news. In 2023, Nova Scotia had the most housing starts since 1940. I want to repeat that. By virtue of federal leadership on this file, our province of Nova Scotia had the most housing of the last 83 years. Even better news is that Nova Scotia is actually on pace to exceed that this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777382">I can see concretely, in my own backyard, the work that the federal program is doing to increase supply. We know it cannot just be supply. Yes, that is important and that, in and of itself, will create more of an affordability context for Canadians, but we have targeted programs to actually help with affordable housing units. What the Conservative Party is offering my constituents is to cut the programs that are promising to help deliver almost 5,000 new housing units in Kings—Hants over the next decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777383">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> stands up and calls mayors incompetent. Does that extend to Mayor Dave Corkum in Kings County? Does that include the warden, Eleanor Roulston, in East Hants? Is he going to come into the place and tell her that she is incompetent? How about Mayor Abraham Zebian in Windsor-West Hants? Is he incompetent? How about his council? How about the Conservative candidate in Kings—Hants who was a municipal councillor? Is the leader of the official opposition suggesting that he is incompetent as well? I would like to know the answer on that because, of course, he was part of the Kings County council that welcomed the federal investment in housing to build more housing in Kings—Hants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777384">It is not constructive to have someone who wants to be the prime minister of this country going around trying to beat up every other level of government. That is not the type of leadership we should expect in this country. It is not the way we should be going about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777385">I want to get to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>'s plan and talk about the ridiculousness of his plan. His private member's bill, which has been widely critiqued by housing advocates in this country as being ineffectual compared with the government programs, actually proposes that if municipalities do not build 15% more housing, then they do not get federal funds. There is irony in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777386">We may have a municipality that is doing very well, working in a pro-development way to build new housing. Let us say it built 100 houses this year. Under the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>'s program, if it did not build 115 next year, he would not give the municipality any federal money to help support the continued growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777387">However, what if a municipality was perhaps underperforming, doing terribly and standing in the way? With the big bureaucracy that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> screams against, if it built five houses, it would only have to build one more in order to get his 15% funding on the Government of Canada side. It makes absolutely no sense, and it is the result of policy and slogans being written on the back of a napkin. It is not good public policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777388">I welcome a conversation on housing, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278578" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> said, but let us have a conversation about concrete ways to get out of this situation. It is not going to be by cutting programs that are helping to build more housing in this country. It is not by cutting programs that are helping with affordable housing units. The Conservatives suggest that they will cut funding to municipalities that, in many cases, need the critical infrastructure to build out. It is easy to say that we want to build a house, but if we do not have the waste water and water infrastructure to do it, it is not going to happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777393">We have built 500,000 homes in this country. There are a lot of good initiatives. There are issues in western liberal democracies right now around homebuilding. A lot of them came on the back of the pandemic, when we did not have supply by virtue of almost 30 years of governments of Canada, successive Liberal and Conservative governments, getting out of the space of federal housing at a time when interest rates from the central banks were very low. Housing prices took off because of the fact that mortgage lending space opened up and there was not enough supply. However, the way to get where we want to go is not by actually cutting the programs that build the supply for the homes we need.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8777405">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the Conservatives' motion on housing. Many, if not all, of the members of the House give genuine priority to housing. However, although everyone here sincerely prioritizes housing, their solutions can vary. One person who genuinely puts a lot of effort into the housing file and will be enlightening us on the subject is the legendary member from <Affiliation DbId="278335" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation>, who is renowned for his verve and punchy delivery. He will follow up on my speech, so I will be sharing my time with him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777406">The Bloc Québécois agrees with the motion in principle, but we have a major problem with how it is drafted, in particular its proposal to have the provinces eliminate the provincial sales tax. The Conservatives are calling on Quebec to eliminate the tax on new housing units. It is not up to the federal government to tell Quebec and the provinces what to do, especially in these desperate times, when we are facing a fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777407">A few days ago we saw a perfect example of the fact we are facing a fiscal imbalance. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that he wanted to grant a three-month GST holiday on a package of goods—here we could have at least discussed what type of goods would be included—and give a $250 cheque to everyone with a net income of $150,000 or less a year, which is a ridiculous measure. That same day, the Quebec finance minister regretfully announced that there was not enough money to maintain the health care and education systems and that he was forced to demand that his various departments stay strictly within their budgets because the books had to balanced at the end of the month. We saw both of these things on the same day: Santa Claus giving out presents, while the provinces tightened their belts. That actually happens every day. That is Canada in 2024, and that has been our reality for a long time now. We would like to see things change in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777408">That said, the federal government has no business telling Quebec what to do, but the federal government could decide to remove the GST on the construction of new housing, and we think that could be a positive thing. However, it is important to remember that new housing represents only 30% of the market, so this measure will have a limited impact on the market. It is also important to remember that, in general, the real estate market in Quebec and Canada is overheating. There is not enough supply to meet the demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777409">Inflation has caused housing prices to skyrocket. We are talking about a 68% increase over the past three years in Quebec. Where did that inflation come from? It came from the fact that every time a house goes on the market, there are 22 potential buyers. Buyers know when they make an offer that they will not be the only ones doing so. That creates a bidding war and drives up housing prices. The value of such transactions affects the value of future transactions. That is a really big problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777410">Removing the GST from housing construction could allow for some breathing room, but we are concerned that this 5% will simply end up in the pockets of developers and sellers. We are concerned about that, but we cannot be against a good thing or against a measure that makes it easier to buy housing. That is why we will be supporting this motion. However, since we have serious concerns, I think it would be a good idea to amend that part of today's motion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777411">We need a lot of housing units. Let us talk percentages. The Liberal government has implemented various programs to facilitate access to housing. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> says he would eliminate these programs at the earliest opportunity to finance his tax cuts. I am not sure that that is the way to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777412">Quebec is already not receiving its share of these programs. Quebec represents 22% of the population of Canada, but it has received only 14% of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's housing accelerator fund. Quebec has received only 6.2% of the budget for the affordable housing fund, even though it represents 22% of the population of Canada. These percentages are bad enough, but it gets worse. CMHC says that 31% of Canada's housing needs are in Quebec. That is strange, because Quebec is expected to pay more for programs in other provinces with smaller populations because the goal is to provide uniform services across the country, yet when Quebec should be getting more than the percentage of the population that it represents, not only does is it not get 31%, it does not even get 22%. It gets 14% and 6%. That is preposterous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777413">At the same time, Quebec is left waiting for funding for its projects, because the federal government's funding always comes with strings attached and specific expectations. It wants to negotiate with Quebec, but this is Quebeckers' own money that it is sending back to them. This money is not a gift from the federal government. It comes from the sales tax and income tax that Quebeckers have paid throughout the year. Quebec should not have to beg for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777414">Consider the last round of negotiations on the affordable housing program. It took three years for the federal government to loosen its purse strings and transfer the funds to Quebec. There were three long years of negotiations. The projects could and should have started in 2017. The housing crisis might be less serious today if we had started earlier. However, because of the negotiations, the projects did not start until 2020. That is the story of housing in Quebec and Canada. If anyone is looking for arguments to support Quebec's political independence, it is not hard to find them in the House. Every day of the week, we find good reasons for Quebec to become independent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777415">The Liberals make all kinds of promises and come up with wishy-washy programs that do not amount to much. The Conservatives want to replace them and say that they are going to get rid of everything. There will no longer be any taxes, and the invisible hand of supply and demand will balance out the market. They are day and night, but they both look similar at dawn. They are like two different shades of grey, and both are unsatisfactory for Quebeckers. We need clear, drastic measures on housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777416">In the last minute that I have left, I will cite some of the things that the Bloc Québécois proposed in its last platform. We proposed putting 1% of the federal government's revenues into social, community and truly affordable housing. That is another topic that cannot be resolved in 10 minutes. When the so-called affordable housing is not affordable in real life because it is too expensive, then we need to have another look at the criteria. We need to recalculate everything. We also proposed that all of the federal government's surplus properties be prioritized for housing development. We proposed charging a tax on real estate speculation to stop people from moving too often or from flipping homes for profit. We proposed a change to the home buyers' plan. We proposed creating an acquisition fund to help first-time buyers come up with a down payment. We also proposed transfers to Quebec with no strings attached. I will close on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777417">I have a message for all the federalist political parties: The best way to increase the housing supply is to transfer the money to Quebec and the provinces. They will figure it out with the municipalities. The federal government has no business telling the municipalities and provinces what to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777424">Madam Speaker, in 1992, the Liberals pulled out of the national housing strategy at a time when we were building 25,000 non-market housing units a year. </ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Gord Johns:</B> Madam Speaker, I grew up in co-op housing, to answer my colleague who just heckled me. Thirty-two years without building those 25,000 units has obviously left us in a huge deficit. In fact, right now we are the lowest in the OECD in non-market housing, at 3.5%. We can look to the Netherlands, where it is at 34%; Denmark, where it is at 21%; or France, where it is at 17% and its goal is 20%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777427">Does my colleague believe that maybe it would be better if we took the GST and returned it to communities where it was collected to build non-market housing? He talked about not telling communities what to do, but how about putting it back in the hands of communities for non-market housing so we could scale up? Maybe he could speak to the importance of that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777429">What I want, as I said in my speech earlier, is for the federal government to stop imposing conditions.

I applaud and would welcome that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777430">The problem my colleague raised in his question goes deeper than that. He mentioned the housing deficit.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8777437">Madam Speaker, I am surprised that the motion the House is taking up today is not a motion of non-confidence. I thought the Conservatives had said they were going to take advantage of every opposition day to try and topple the government. I do not know what is going on, but it does seem like part of a pattern, because today's motion strikes me as typical of the tactics employed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. I call this the Carleton method. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777438">What does this method look like? It often involves focusing on populist proposals based on simplistic notions in response to complex problems. Every time I see a Conservative motion, that is what it looks like. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> said earlier that the Bloc Québécois was going to vote in favour of this motion. However, we are doing so somewhat reluctantly, because the motion contains a trap. Reducing taxes may stimulate housing construction, but we need to go a little further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777439">That is why I think we need to ditch the Carleton method, which consists of overly simplistic proposals that often take the form of political rhetoric and catchy sound bytes. It seems to me that, during their last leadership race, the Conservatives chose a leader who would be better suited for an advertising agency than for the job of prime minister. I say this without rancor. He is great at coming up with slogans, but as for innovative solutions, I have yet to see any.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777440">It is symptomatic of what we have been seeing in the House for a while now. For the Conservatives, politics seems to be boil down to chanting slogans. Some of my colleagues may have seen groups of people laying hands, chanting and expecting results. That is what I think of when I hear the Conservatives. Some of my colleagues may be familiar with the Conservative Party's chants: axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget. I do not know whether they intend to use a drill and a screwdriver, but they want to fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777441">Every time I hear the leader of the Conservative Party, all of those chants make me think about François Truffaut's films, of which I am a fan. It makes me think of the film <I>The 400 Blows</I>, as well as the sequel, <I>Stolen Kisses</I>. There is an interesting character in these films called Antoine Doinel. To illustrate his lust for Fabienne Tabard, Truffaut shows him in front of a mirror for a long time compulsively repeating the name Fabienne Tabard. He thinks he will get somewhere if he just keeps repeating it, but in the end, his lecherous desire will go unrequited. I feel like I am watching a cheap new version of a Truffaut film when I hear the leader of the official opposition repeat his political rhetoric and formulas ad nauseum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777442">The solution put forward in this political rhetoric is fundamentally cosmetic. When faced with complex political problems, one needs structuring measures. I will explain why I believe the Conservatives' proposal is not a structuring measure, even though we will be voting for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777443">First, I listened to the leader of the official opposition's speech earlier. He clearly said that we needed to end bureaucracy. The most populist discourse is the one that accuses politicians of taking money away from workers, wanting to steal from them and rob them of what is theirs. They forget to mention that we also collect sales tax and income tax to be able to offer services. The leader of the official opposition is very careful not to mention that we collect sales tax and income tax to be able to offer services. In his speech, he said he wanted to take money away from the politicians and give it directly back to citizens, to workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777444">I have a different interpretation of what he is proposing. I get the impression that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the official opposition is funding a populist measure on the backs of the provinces. We see at the end of the motion that the member for Carleton clearly intends to ensure that the provincial premiers also remove the sales tax on new construction. In Quebec's case, that would be the QST.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777445">That is quite problematic because, as my colleague indicated earlier, in Quebec's case, the forecast for housing starts next year is $18 billion. Removing the QST would mean a $1.8-billion shortfall for Quebec. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> is not saying so, but in his motion he is asking the Quebec government to forgo $1.8 billion when Quebec's deficit is nearly $13 billion. Any reasonable person would understand that Quebec cannot agree to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777446">There is a relatively simple notion in the Canadian federation, and that is fiscal imbalance. What does the federal government always do when it needs to tighten its belt? It cuts transfer payments and transfers the tax burden of its policies onto the provinces. That is the oldest trick in the book. Even Jean Chrétien said that it was the best thing since sliced bread, because that means there is no political price to pay. When the leader of the official opposition says that he will put more in workers' pockets, he means that he will get the money from the provinces, like Quebec, that are already having difficulty carrying out their responsibilities in education and health care. My colleagues know as well as I do that health care and child care in Quebec is chronically underfunded. If $1.8 billion is cut from Quebec and the deficit increases, that would once more compromise Quebec's mission, which is to put in place the social safety net that is helping families who are already having a hard time. Eliminating a service on the one hand and allowing them to save on the purchase of a house on the other is not a structuring measure. In my opinion, it does nothing to solve the fiscal imbalance. Let us take this a bit further. A quick calculation shows that, with this $1.8 billion, Quebec could finance almost 20,000 social housing units. In some way, the leader of the official opposition would deprive Quebec of 20,000 social housing units. For these reasons, the motion put forward by our Conservative colleagues could benefit from an amendment. I will get back to that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777447">Why do I say this is not a structuring measure? It is because I feel that my Conservative Party colleagues never tackle the real problems. What brought on the housing crisis in Quebec? Immigration is responsible for much of it. I have never seen my Conservative colleagues hold an opposition day to oppose the Century Initiative, the Liberals' political commitment to act in such a way as to ensure that Quebec loses all control over immigration and that unprecedented pressure is exerted on the various services. I have never heard the Conservatives talk about that. They are not tackling a central problem, namely immigration. They have only started doing that recently. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777448">Another problem they have been silent on is the one raised by the the Canadian Construction Association. The people in this association have made it clear to us, in numerous meetings, that home construction and housing cannot be considered in a vacuum. It takes infrastructure, but the municipalities' infrastructure deficit is so high that it might well take $128 billion to build this infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777449">I will close by discussing the TECQ program, or the gas tax and Quebec's contribution. If we want better municipal infrastructure, it is inevitable that the municipalities must have access to the funding they need. Unfortunately, however, the government did not renew the TECQ.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777450">I move the following amendment: That the motion be amended by deleting the words “and call on the provincial premiers to match this proposal”.</ParaText>

His courage left an indelible mark, including the time in 1993 he accompanied Canadian peacekeepers in war-torn Bosnia. He played a key role at historic moments, such as when he supported the fight for Hôpital Montfort's survival. His commitment to the francophonie, his humanity and his ability to make us think, laugh and cry touched an entire community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777797">I am afraid that an extremely dangerous precedent is being set with respect to how you, Mr. Speaker, are allowing questions to continue when they are clearly not about the administration of business. Today, we had a number of Conservatives bringing up issues and talking about the NDP for the entire question. Finally, at the end of the question, they said, for instance, “Will the Prime Minister let the NDP leader do something?” However, this was clearly not in line with government business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777798"> I go back to my question from a week and a half ago. I started by talking clearly about government measures. My question started, “Mr. Speaker, last week our government announced measures”, and it went on. At the end of my question, I specifically asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> should allow his MPs to vote in favour of that legislation. Somehow, Mr. Speaker, you deemed my question out of order, but when we see what is going on today, you routinely allow those questions to stand. </ParaText>

Nevertheless, having the guidance that you gave, we did not get up afterwards and challenge your ruling or insult your ability to handle question period. We just simply adapted and followed the precedents that you have set out for the chamber.</ParaText>

We have learned very quickly that, if the Conservatives create enough chaos, the Speaker bends to that. When New Democrats raise points of order, they are shut down. We are told to sit down.

              <ParaText id="8777831"> Madam Speaker, I move that the third report of the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, presented on Monday, June 13, 2022, be concurred in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777832">I will be sharing my time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777833">Christmas is approaching, and I want to wish colleagues a merry Christmas as they begin their preparations. As I have been reflecting on the Christmas story, it seems closer to home than ever. We have a distant, unfeeling Emperor Caesar Augustus who is bent on raising taxes, and this poor young couple who travels to Bethlehem. There is a housing shortage, so they have to give birth in a barn. If only Caesar Augustus had axed the tax and built the homes, it would have been a more comfortable first Christmas. However, it does show that God can come to us in the midst of challenging circumstances, so I do wish colleagues a merry Christmas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777834"> Conservative priorities are clear. They are to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Today, we are focusing on the need to build the homes. Indeed, Conservatives are ready for a carbon tax election. If the Liberal government does not want a carbon tax election, how about a housing election? We are ready to contrast our constructive proposals to build the homes in this country with the demonstrable record of failure that we have seen from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777835"> The Liberals put forward something called the housing accelerator fund. They think that people will believe that it is accelerating homes just because it is in the name. However, they admit that this program they have put forward does not build homes. It gives extra money to already inflated bureaucracies, and it feeds those bureaucracies instead of actually contributing to the construction of homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777836">The Conservative opposition has put forward a meaningful and constructive proposal that is being debated today. It is about providing real relief to homeowners. In order to save Canadian homebuyers up to $50,000, or $2,500 per year, in mortgage payments, our motion is to call on the Liberal government to immediately eliminate the federal sales tax on new homes sold under $1 million and to call on the provincial premiers to match this proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777837">Particularly this afternoon, we are debating the concurrence of the third report of the indigenous affairs committee, which deals specifically with indigenous peoples and the need for housing policies that allow indigenous Canadians, all Canadians, to be able to access the homes that they need. This is why we have put forward proposals that do actually build homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777838">In this debate about housing policy, we can see the old story of New Democrats and Liberals wanting to be judged by their intentions instead of by results. Conservatives believe that the effectiveness of a political party and of their policies should be judged not by the intentions or by how much money is being spent, but by the actual results in terms of the affordability of homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777839"> What Canadians care about when it comes to housing is not fundamentally how much the government is spending on housing. It is how much Canadians who are renting or buying have to spend on housing. That is really the acid test of a housing policy. It is not how much money the government is spending, but how much money the individual who is buying or renting has to spend in order to make that purchase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777840"> In fact, under the Liberal government, the record of failure is very clear. Housing prices have doubled, rent has doubled and costs are way up as a result of the policies of the government. There are many different reasons why these policies they are proposing are not working. It does not take much of an analysis to know that they are not working. One simply has to look at the results. Canadians of all backgrounds are paying more for housing than they ever have. They are paying more for housing in a country that has an abundance of land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777841"> Liberals have blamed inflation on supply chains, yet they have not reckoned with the fact that the land we use is right here. We have more land than almost any country around the world, yet our housing prices are higher than almost anywhere else.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777842">If we compare where we were nine years ago, in 2015, and where we are now after nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the record is clear that Liberal policies are failing. Under the leadership of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, we have sharply put the spotlight on the problem of housing affordability and the centrality of building new homes, so we have put forward a constructive proposal for how to do this. We have been very specific in our proposals around housing. We have been very specific in what we have put before the House and what we have put before Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777843"> We have proposed a framework, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, our leader, has put forward a private member's bill on it, whereby municipalities would be expected to meet certain targets in terms of new home construction. They would have flexibility in terms of how they do it. It would not be up to the federal government to decide precisely what to build or where to build it, but there would be an expectation, as there has to be an expectation, that every level of government would work together to ensure sufficient construction of new homes. If municipalities fail to meet those targets, they would face clawbacks in terms of federal funding, and if they meet or exceed those targets, they would receive a bonus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777844">The policy would tie federal spending to the requirement of results when it comes to housing. This would bring the kind of results orientation that Canadians expect from their government. I heard a member opposite say that this is common sense, and I agree. He is coming around. It is common sense to measure one's housing policy by the results. We would hold ourselves to that standard—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777849">The focus of Conservatives is on delivering results for Canadians, and our housing policy would hold us to that standard of delivering results. It would also hold our municipal partners to the expectation of meeting the requirements around new home construction. We have also put forward a motion today that, on top of the existing plan, would build on it by providing tax relief directly to facilitate the construction of new homes and to make it easier for Canadians to purchase new homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777850">The third report of INAN deals specifically with housing for indigenous people, and the failure of the government to build homes has ripple effects across all dimensions, all communities and all parts of Canadian society. The government has made many promises with respect to indigenous reconciliation, yet right now we are seeing its scandalous failure to follow through on those promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777851">It is a scandalous failure because Liberals have actually allowed a whole industry of non-indigenous elite insiders and pretenders to take advantage of programs and policies that were promised to indigenous Canadians. There are people inside the government, like the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, who have pretended to be indigenous in order to advance their own commercial interests as well as their own political interests. Moreover, there is a turning of a blind eye to the whole industry of fake, non-indigenous pretenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777852"> It was reported in today's Globe and Mail that an auditor was trying to draw attention to the problem of abuse of programs that are supposed to benefit indigenous people, yet that auditor had continuous roadblocks put in the way. The government actually imposed new rules to constrain and limit the work of auditors at the same time as those auditors were coming forward to identify the rampant issue of pretenders taking advantage of the policies. The government, it seems, wanted to allow the abuse to go on so it could make it look like it was doing better and could say, “Look at all this money we are giving to indigenous people,” when, actually, fraudsters and non-indigenous elites were taking advantage of the programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777853">Therefore we need to build the homes in this country and restore the promise of reconciliation, and that is exactly what a Conservative government would do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777868">As I mentioned, I have been doing a lot of work on the issue of abuses in the area of indigenous procurement. It is a situation where the government wants to look like it is achieving a certain target in terms of procurement from indigenous businesses. It has achieved that target by padding the numbers with a lot of joint venture arrangements or companies that are not actually indigenous-owned and indigenous-controlled. This allows it to say it has reached its target. The AFN is saying it is more like 1% of contracts, even though the government says it has met its 5% target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777869">When there is a government that is not interested in the results but is interested only in looking like it cares, people are trying to find workarounds to say they have achieved the target, they have checked the box, rather than being concerned about the results. On housing, again, it is very clear that the conversation with the government is all about how much it is spending and not about how much Canadians have to spend.

              <ParaText id="8777886">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada’s Criminal Code listing regime is an important tool for countering terrorism in Canada and globally, and is part of the government’s commitment to keep people in Canada safe. The listing of terrorist entities is a rigorous process, based on evidence, intelligence and the law, as a listing carries significant consequences. Throughout this process, any decision to designate as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code is based on solid and factual considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777887">The government remains concerned with the Houthis’ ongoing attacks against commercial and naval vessels transiting the Red Sea and surrounding waterways, which continue to threaten the lives of innocent mariners and global trade in one of the world’s most critical waterways. Houthi attacks have also endangered the lives of the Yemeni people as ships carrying aid have been targeted. Canada will continue to support the United States-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, alongside the United Kingdom, Australia, Bahrain, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777888">In collaboration with allies and like-minded partners, the Government of Canada is exploring all possible measures to constrain the activities of those who would threaten the safety and security of Canadians. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8777962"> Madam Speaker, before I begin, I just want to take a moment at the top to acknowledge the good folks of Parry Sound—Muskoka, particularly on the south end of Muskoka, who have endured a pretty brutal welcome to winter. It is my first opportunity to do this in this place. Not last week, but the weekend before, the area of Gravenhurst received just over five feet of snow in two days. It was a pretty tough time. Highway 11 is the main corridor in and out of the eastern side of Muskoka, and it was closed both northbound and southbound for more than 24 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777963">I just want to take a moment to thank all those frontline workers. We had Muskoka paramedics, the OPP, the fire department, Hydro One workers and municipal operations crews, who were all on the front lines. We did not lose a soul, which is amazing. The mayor, Heidi Lorenz, had to declare a state of emergency in Gravenhurst. They got through it. It is still snowing a bit, but it is a little more manageable now. I think we are going to get through it. I just wanted to give that quick shout-out to all those frontline workers. I know we appreciate them in all of our ridings; they can quite literally save lives. They certainly did over the last few days in Parry Sound—Muskoka.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777964"> During this study on indigenous peoples, indigenous people shared some pretty alarming experiences related to housing in their communities. They emphasized the housing shortage. Its effects are well known. Numerous studies have been conducted and we keep studying the issue, even though the situation is one in which we need action. This is a pretty common theme with the government, really. After nine years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, housing problems are fairly well known, not just on first nations but also across the country. Rents, mortgages and house prices have doubled, and indigenous peoples are still suffering from inadequate housing. We see it all over the place. Here we are: Let us have another study and see how bad the situation is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777965">I do not think we need any more studies. We need action. I think back to the good folks in Muskoka and just imagine if, in the face of those horrible weather events, we decided to do a study instead of acting. This is a crisis. In crises, we act, but we are not acting. We need action on housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777966">In March, the Auditor General released a report covering housing in first nations communities. They found that, overall, since 2018, the government has supported only 4,379 completed housing units. That is about 700 per year. Here are some headlines, some real key quotes from the report: “Indigenous Services Canada and the [CMHC] had not provided the [housing] support needed by First Nations” and “Indigenous Services Canada and the [CMHC] have made little progress in improving housing conditions in First Nations communities.” Here is another one: “The department and the corporation were not on track to meet the government's commitment to close the housing gap by 2030.” Another finding was that indigenous services and the CMHC have made little progress in supporting first nations to improve housing conditions in their community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777967">This sounds awfully familiar in terms of what we have been hearing at our HUMA committee over the last little while, as well as from MPs all over the country. We have heard back that the CMHC is really difficult to work with. It is a broken institution. It is a lot of paperwork and a lot of bureaucracy, and it takes forever to get responses. In many cases, particularly for smaller community groups that have their ducks in a row, they go to the CMHC and just give up. In many cases, the CMHC seems to be the place where projects go to die. We heard that the government does not have a strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777968">Another quote from the report said, “We found that Indigenous Services Canada and the [CMHC] accepted the Assembly of First Nations' 2021 estimate of the housing gap. However, the department and the corporation did not have a strategy to support First Nations in closing the housing gap by 2030.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777969"> There was a lack of collaboration between the department and the CMHC. We heard from this report that there are 13 programs at the CMHC alone and that this cumbersome application process continues to be a problem. This is not only for the small community groups we hear from in our ridings but also, certainly, for first nations. Another quote from the report says, “We found that a significant challenge for First Nations communities in general was navigating the different application and reporting requirements of the many programs”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777970">This is a pattern with the government. The bureaucracy put in place by the government has been expanded dramatically. It obstructs homebuilding.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8777971">Many MPs have heard from organizations in their communities that are trying to get housing built. It is often impossible to get an answer. There is so much red tape and bureaucracy that they often give up, and it is no different in first nations communities. The CMHC has also created a whole new consulting class, it seems, of high-priced consultants who are hired to fill out these applications. People need a degree in filling out government applications to get answers. Sometimes, organizations spend years stuck at the CMHC, waiting for an answer to their applications; sometimes, the rules change partway through the process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777972">Conservatives have a different approach. We will reform the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation from a bureaucracy of policy, paperwork and painfully slow approaches to a “get homes built” corporation. We will do it by putting executive bonuses and salaries on the chopping block unless a 60-day response requirement is met. People will get a response in 60 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777973">Another thing we heard about in this report was that housing on reserve may not be built according to building codes. Here is another important bit of information: “Indigenous Services Canada and the [CMHC] did not have assurance that all housing units built and repaired with the support of their funding programs met applicable building code standards.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777974"> This is another interesting one. We have heard at HUMA as well that, in some cases, CMHC forces builders, community groups and housing providers to go above and beyond the national and provincial building codes. This often comes in the form of additional energy efficiency requirements. The cost can be as high as $30,000 per door. Of course, this means Canadians are paying that price. In this case, the housing that was constructed may not have met the current building codes, never mind going beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777975"> There can be no doubt that we need building code reform in this country. Our building code has been developed over decades without any consideration of affordability. However, at the same time as we need that reform, we have to be sure that the homes Canadians live in are safe. That is certainly true for first nations communities as well. Indigenous communities have incredible potential to really drive the change that they need to see. Indigenous people are the leaders in their community, and they know what they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777976"> I have met with Justin Marchand, the CEO of Ontario Aboriginal Housing Services. He has become a good friend, and we have met a number of times. Just recently, we met in my office, and he was telling me that OAHS has expanded; it now manages 3,000 units. That is an asset base of about $320 million. This makes it one of the premier indigenous housing providers in this country. When Mr. Marchand was in my office the other day with one of his other team members, we talked about how burdensome and painful the red tape at the federal level can be in terms of getting housing built. Interestingly enough, he also spoke quite favourably about the Conservative plan to make available 15% of the federal real estate portfolio to get housing built and get it built quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777977">He pointed out that his group would prefer, instead of some kind of lease, to own the land. There are a couple of reasons for that. The first one is that, as he pointed out, indigenous people do not need some bureaucrat here in Ottawa to tell them how to do things and get things done, and all the red tape and conditions are the last things they need. The other point is that if the OAHS owns the land, then it can use the asset to leverage the asset and leverage the projects it builds to get the next ones built. It could actually get more units built, which makes complete sense. Ontario Aboriginal Housing Services has demonstrated it can do that and do it very well. Mr. Marchand pointed out that, in some cases, the best thing for aboriginal people is to get the government out of the way. We really see that across the country; there are lots of statistics and data about what is going on. What we see in this report is a mirror of what is going on in the rest of the country; of course, in many ways, it is worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777978">We have talked a lot about housing. The government members have talked a lot about their national housing strategy. It is an $80-billion strategy that, in the end, has had precisely the opposite effect of what we needed to have. It cannot be this way any longer. It takes Canadians too much of their hard-earned money to buy or rent a home. When 30% of the cost of every new home in this country is government, that is a problem. Nobody makes more money on housing than governments. One of the most effective ways we can get the cost of housing down is to get government out of the way. Conservatives would actually do that by reforming the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation; however, most importantly, we would eliminate the federal sales tax on the sale of homes under $1 million, which could save Canadians $50,000.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777979">Madam Speaker, the member's speech did not deal specifically with this, but the previous member's speech did. The bill by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> on housing was discussed in an article in The Globe and Mail not long ago by Campbell Clark. The headline was about a town in my riding. It was, “Pointe-Claire demonstrates the nonsense in [the Leader of the Opposition]'s housing formula”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777980">Under the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s bill, a municipality where the housing stock rose by 15% vis-à-vis the previous year would get some kind of bonus, but one where the rate of increase did not exceed 15% would be penalized. The problem is that it really hurts municipalities that have built a lot of homes in the previous year because they have to exceed that by so much more. There is an example in the article, in which they talk about the city of Kirkland. This is a small municipality next to the city of Pointe-Claire that only built one unit in 2022. This means that Kirkland only has to build two homes the following year to get the incentive, whereas a bigger city would have to build so many more homes to get the incentive or not be penalized. I would like to hear the hon. member's views on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8777981"> Madam Speaker, I guess there was not really a question, but the language around that is designed to identify areas in this country where it is particularly expensive and slow to get homes built. Our point in this discussion is that, right now, governments make too much money on housing. They charge too much and, at the local level, they take far too long to approve the development of new housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777982">When it can take six years to get a piece of property zoned to precisely what is on either side, it costs money. In the real world, time is money, and that makes housing more expensive. That is not the case around here, of course; this place is ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8777983">The fact of the matter is that we need to reduce the cost of government on every new home. The way we are going to do that is not by shovelling more money out the door and hoping municipalities do better; there have to be consequences. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778002">Now, let us think about this. We have the Conservative Party saying that we need to do more on indigenous housing, but one of their major policy election platform issues for 2025 is to get rid of the housing accelerator.

At the end of the day, the Grand Poobah, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> says, “accelerator fund, bad. We are going to vote against it, and if we are ever in government, we are going to get rid of it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778006"> I have done a little homework. There is a long list, and I am going to run out of time, but the number of first nations is fairly significant. Let me give a couple of examples where these are Conservative-held ridings, where the accelerator fund is there to support indigenous communities: Skowkale First Nation in Chilliwack—Hope and the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation in Manitoba. There is a very lengthy list of individuals, cities and indigenous groups that are receiving significant amounts of money through the housing accelerator fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778007"> The Conservatives will say that it is not building homes. It is not simply here is a plot of land, build a house. There are all forms of things that need to be done, like infrastructure. There is some red tape out there. We have a federal government that has recognized that we can play a role in providing supports through the accelerator fund to get more homes built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778008">If the Conservatives did their homework on this file, they would find that indigenous housing would benefit from this program, the very same program that they are saying they are going to cut. On the other hand, today, they are saying that we are not doing enough. I will get back into some more comments on the accelerator fund shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778009">This is the first time that I have seen an opposition party introduce a concurrence motion on its very own opposition day. I have been trying to think why the Conservative Party would do that, and I think I might have figured it out. Apparently, last week, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was embarrassed because he was all primed and pumped, and ready to deliver a speech here on the floor of the House of Commons, and the NDP outmaneuvered him by moving concurrence on a committee report. That was an embarrassing moment for the leader of the Conservative Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778010"> The Conservatives played a game on Friday. They are trying to pay back, but I guess they learned something from that and they wanted to be able to talk about housing today. After all, that is what their opposition motion is on. They dug up a report on housing to move concurrence on, so they could prevent the NDP from potentially bringing in a concurrence motion. That would spoil the Conservatives' day because they did not like the concurrence motion the NDP brought in last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778011"> That is the only thing I can think of, in regard to why the Conservatives raised this particular report, because it is a game to the Conservative Party. What surprises me is that the Conservatives have an opposition day and I would have thought, as a Conservative Party, that they would have been following issues like trade, given what has taken place with the new president-elect, that trade would have been a hot discussion within the Conservative Party. It would have been a very productive day to have a discussion on trade. The Conservatives could have drawn some sort of a motion that would actually be voted on, which would have told Canadians exactly what they would be dealing with on that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778012"> It is important. In fact, just this last five or six days, I participated in a trade mission in the Philippines with our <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. It was an incredible experience. We had arguably one of the largest delegations in Manila; even President Marcos made reference to it. It was like speed dating among businesses between Canada and the Philippines, trying to make connections, and we had some wonderful announcements. An exploratory discussion is taking place soon on coming up with a trade agreement between Canada and the Philippines. Air Canada came forward and talked about increasing the number of direct flights between Vancouver and Manila: four coming up in April. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778013"> Trade matters. As a government, we recognize that. As an opposition party, the Conservatives are found wanting. Today would have been a good opportunity to have that discussion because the last time, outside of an emergency debate, was when the Conservatives actually voted against the first-ever trade agreement, the Ukraine trade agreement. I would have thought the Conservative Party would deal with something of that nature, and that is not to take anything away from housing. Yes, they are the official opposition. They get to choose the issue, so they have chosen housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778014"> On the housing file, no government in generations has done more for Canadians than the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and government, in terms of dollars and real, tangible results. We recognize the federal government has a role to play. I contrast that to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, who, when he was the minister responsible for housing, did absolutely nothing, nothing at all. I should not say that; he actually managed to build six houses, I am told. I have no idea where those houses are, but I am told he built a half-dozen homes, but nothing else, and now he wants us to listen to what the Conservatives have to say about housing. We have heard that story before.</ParaText>

It is not like a house appears out of nowhere. There is a planning component to it. Has anyone ever heard the leader of the Conservative Party stand in this place and talk about what he did as minister of housing for indigenous people, or for Canadians as a whole, beyond those six hidden houses? Who knows where they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778016">There is a lot of room for improvement. Our government is the first in generations to put forward a housing strategy for Canadians. It is more than just words. We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, going into billions of dollars. It is a housing strategy that deals with affordable housing and ensures someone could have ongoing income supports, where rent is based on a percentage of one's income in non-profit housing units. The government has invested in different ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778017">Ironically, the Liberals made a commitment for purpose-built rentals. Members will recall that from a couple of years back. That was actually taking away GST on new builds. The Conservatives voted against it: GST forgiveness for purpose-built rentals and the Conservatives did not support that. For every housing initiative by the government, the Conservatives have avoided any accountability on housing, and they vote against it. Does anyone wonder why? I would suggest we know the reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778018"> I wanted to get what I find to be an absolutely delightful quote. At the end of the day, everything is driven through the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>'s office. When we think of the quotes the leader of the Conservative Party uses, and we have already witnessed it today, he likes to reward Conservatives who say the slogans or the bumper sticker words. If they do that, they get rewarded with gold stars. I figure they have individuals in the back who keep track and say, “Oh, so-and-so said it three times: three stars for the day.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778019">There are some Conservatives who get offside, like the 15 or 17 members of Parliament who wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> to say how wonderful the housing accelerator fund was. Obviously, it was because they were asking for support in their communities. That was offside. They were not supposed to do that, so they might have lost some stars. If a Conservative member does not do what they are being told to do, they lose stars. It is frowned upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778020"> It is amazing. I cannot give an exact quote, but later I can table a document if the Conservatives will let me. If they want to come and talk to a Liberal MP, that is considered a bad thing. They are not supposed to fraternize with—</ParaText>

There is so much potential with that program and looking at the expansion of housing co-ops. Last month, I was at a press conference hosted by Raising the Roof. Funding was provided by the federal government to Raising the Roof, an organization based in Ontario and now in Manitoba, to remodel and revitalize a home on Mountain Avenue. The house was dilapidated and the organization turned it into a wonderful rental. It is a great example of how the federal government, whether through the accelerator fund or other programs, is working with different municipalities, indigenous leaders and others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778026">It is something that is very local, involving many different stakeholders. Raising the Roof went to Manitoba, found a project on Mountain Avenue and went to Purpose Construction. Purpose Construction is a social enterprise that has done phenomenal work in hiring individuals, increasing their skill sets and showing them, in many ways, the benefits of the construction industry. They are the ones who did the work on Mountain Avenue. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778058">Madam Speaker, it is an honour, once again, to rise in the House to speak about access to housing, which is a fundamental issue, particularly for first nations. I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for Longueuil—Saint-Hubert. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778059">I would like to start by mentioning that question period in the House is always a bit ironic. For months now, the government has been responding to questions from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> by sardonically pointing out that when he was the minister responsible for infrastructure and housing, he built only six housing units. They keep pointing at him and repeating the word “six”. What is the reality for indigenous communities, however? What is the actual budget that the government gives to each community to build housing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778060">It is important to remember that Canada's fastest growing populations are first nations, Métis and Inuit. What is the current government doing? It is not doing anything more. It is allowing the construction of two, not six, but two housing units per indigenous community, even though the need is much greater. What does that mean? It means that the further north we go, the more we see three or four families living in the same home. We hear of situations where people have to take turns watching television and sitting on the couch in the evenings. The reality is that they do not have access to beds because three or even four families are sharing the same home. In the community of Long Point in the village of Winneway in my riding, there are 21 people living in one house. Is that normal? The answer is obviously no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778061">Why does that situation exist? It is because this government is stingy with first nations. It is stingy when it comes time to give communities the means to take control of their own destiny, particularly when it comes to economic reconciliation, which includes the ability to build housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778062">Obviously the motion being debated in the House today is important. One of the most tangible solutions that has to be adopted comes from the first nations themselves. I think that is the right path to take in a context of economic reconciliation. I am, of course, talking about the Yänonhchia' initiative, which comes to us from leaders, including the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador, or AFNQL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778063">I want to acknowledge the remarkable work of Lance Haymond, the chief of Kebaowek First Nation, which is in my riding. His lifelong mission has been to give the members of his community and first nations in general access to housing and property. He has also worked to ensure that the indigenous middle class could have access to prosperity. I think that is our common objective. This must be shared and accessible to all first nations members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778064">There is something else I would like to talk about. Today, I had to leave the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, which had invited the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="300006" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> to testify. We wanted to ask them about the fundamental issue of “pretendians” who receive government contracts even though they do not qualify as indigenous. This is a real problem. I wanted to raise the issue of government funding with the minister to see whether it is going to the right places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778065">I have to say I have some concerns at the moment. Last week, the Assembly of First Nations was here in Ottawa. We learned that the Liberal government organized a cocktail party with members of the first nations. If they wished to have access to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the minister in order to ask them questions, particularly about housing, they were asked what was the maximum contribution that each individual could give. Is that the norm? I have been thinking about that a lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778066">We hear through the grapevine that the Minister of Indigenous Services has yet to make a formal request to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to ensure that initiatives such as Yänonhchia' are funded by the government. Many representations have been made. About half an hour ago, I asked the minister directly whether she had sent an official letter to the Minister of Finance to ask her to fund the Yänonhchia' initiative, which she seemed to strongly support. She has had several meetings with the NACCA proponents and Lance Haymond. The answer I received is that no, the letter has not been sent. Does this government know how to make any effort? I seriously wonder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778067">As of today's date, December 9, those letters should have been sent.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8778068">In fact, we know that if a budget has to be tabled in March, this has to be done. The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has to be asked. No formal request has been made, and that raises a number of questions in my mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778069">We are talking about letters. Sending a letter is complicated. For one thing, the request has to be made formally and received by the federal bureaucracy. I sent a letter on March 12 to the Minister of Finance. She cannot deny that this request came from the House or that it was formally made with the support of the first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778070">At the time, I was already making an urgent appeal to the minister for federal support for the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association, or NACCA. I still appreciate that organization for its leadership to this day. I asked for increased funding for NACCA because the solution will come from first nations being financially self-sufficient. I asked for that increase because solutions will come from first nations members themselves and because these funds will be managed by and for first nations communities. A specific request was made as early as March last year. I would like to point out that the request was successful, because NACCA did receive additional funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778071">The same thing needs to be done for housing, which is what I did on November 21 when I wrote another letter to the Minister of Finance. I am going to read from that letter, because I think it is in the public interest, especially right now.</ParaText>

Housing affordability for these groups must be supported by responsive funding policies that would enable these middle class families to become homeowners, while ensuring that social housing continues to be reserved for those who need it most.</QuotePara>

I am referring to the whole matter of recruiting, retaining and training indigenous staff who work on housing. Two housing units are made available by the government every year, if that. At the same time, these units have to be built in a ridiculously short amount of time. Quite often, money intended for indigenous peoples is returned to the federal treasury because of the many bureaucratic requirements and standards that indigenous communities are unable to meet. </ParaText>

It was willing to provide funding, but first it wanted to know how big the space and the beds would be, how many pillowcases would be needed, how many pencils would be used to count the number of homeless people using the shelter and what colour the walls would be painted. There were all sorts of bureaucratic hurdles, which meant that the agreement did not get signed and the money was not allocated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778104">Quebec was prepared to match Ottawa's offer, which was close to $60 million. Quebec was prepared to put in the same amount. There were negotiations. Finally, the agreement was signed two weeks ago, but the devil is in the details. Not only is it winter now, but the deadline for projects submissions for this funding is January 7. I am not making this up. The fund was announced in March. The deadline for submissions is January 7. These projects will not see the light of day until the end of this winter. They will not help this winter. I have to pinch myself. When we talk about delays related to the housing crisis, this is what we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778105">I wrote a report that is related to the report on indigenous housing. I toured Quebec. I set out on a pilgrimage. One time, I had a meeting with a group in Saint‑Hyacinthe, I think. I thought I was being so smart. I got the numbers from CMHC and I presented them to the representatives of the community groups sitting across from me. They did not know what I was talking about. They said that the situation was much worse than my numbers suggested. On the ground, the situation was serious. They needed far more housing than what I was saying, and the vacancy rates were much lower than what I was saying. The numbers did not reflect the reality on the ground.</ParaText>

I met with people from more than 600 organizations that work every day to build social and community housing, to help the most vulnerable people in our country, in Quebec and Canada, find a place to live. These organizations help women who are victims of domestic violence, seniors, people with substance abuse problems and the many vulnerable populations that we need to take care of, that we have a responsibility to care for. I toured Quebec and then produced a 150-page report. The summary is about 20 pages long, and I have it here—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778109">Madam Speaker, I am talking about the report that I have in my hands right now. My colleagues cannot see it, but they can sense that there is something important in it, and I am going to tell them about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778110">It is a bit funny, I have 12 recommendations. Just before the first one, I wrote that the federal government should get out of housing. I will explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778111">Every time the federal government has made a new funding announcement in the past few years, Quebec has said that the federal government is not going to spend a penny in Quebec without the Quebec government having a say in the matter. Then the negotiations begin. The federal government launched its grand national housing strategy in 2017. It allocated $82 billion across Canada. The government spent money just about everywhere. We are still wondering where exactly. It spent money in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and St. John's, Newfoundland. There was not one penny for Quebec because Quebec declined, as is its prerogative. We wanted money, not programs. We wanted money, not criteria. We wanted money, not conditions. That led to three years of waiting. Earlier I was talking about the $250‑million homelessness program. It took a year before a decision was made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778112">Too many players are involved in housing. At the end of the day, housing is built in cities. Cities make bylaws, manage urban planning and organize construction. In fact, cities need money. The infrastructure fund is another fund that has a critical role to play in relation to the housing crisis. This $6‑billion fund is currently being negotiated with Quebec. Just building housing is not enough. Sewers need to be built too. Homes need to be connected to the sewer system. Roads need to be built. All these things are important for housing. Two or three weeks ago, the Association de la construction du Québec came to Ottawa to say that infrastructure is fundamental and that this funding is needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778113">Cities organize housing construction. Quebec also has a housing department and various programs. Then, on top of all that, the federal government comes in and adds its own conditions. Take Rimouski, for example. There are problems there. The city should and would like to house women fleeing domestic violence. That is true everywhere in Quebec, but I want to focus on Rimouski. There are needs in this area. Every day, a woman knocks on the door of a shelter for women fleeing domestic violence and then goes home. We know what going home means. It happens every day. There is a desperate need for resources. In Rimouski, creating a shelter like that would mean building a 32-unit building for women who are victims of domestic violence. As it happens, Quebec has a program for that. It might be through the Fédération des associations et corporations en construction du Québec. It used to be AccèsLogis Québec. An organization would apply and wait one to two years. Finally, it would get the go-ahead. Great, it was getting funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778114">If there is not enough money, it can apply to Ottawa, which has another program that grants funding. The criteria are different, however, especially when it comes to affordability. The affordability criteria make absolutely no sense. They are a disaster. Another two years is spent waiting on Ottawa. Often, in the meantime, the four-year-old offer to purchase the property falls through. In short, the whole thing is infuriating. The process takes years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778115">While I was touring Abitibi, I met Stéphane Grenier, a really amazing guy. He is a university professor who cares for homeless people, including homeless indigenous people. I attended the opening of a magnificent shelter, a brand-new building with 41 spaces. It opened a year ago, but people had been working on the project for eight years. That means eight winters, eight years of people looking for an emergency shelter, only to give up because one did not exist. It is infuriating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778116">Here is my first recommendation. Fiscal tools are available here in Ottawa. If Ottawa agreed that this is a provincial jurisdiction and if it gave the money to Quebec, just as it does for health care, there would be fewer players involved. This would achieve two things: it would shorten project approval times and lower costs. Everyone would win. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778121">The rapid housing initiative is a very good program; everyone applauds it. There have been three phases. The first phase was $1 billion, and the other two were $1.5 billion, unless I am mistaken. These are 100% subsidized social housing units. Everyone in Quebec loves this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778122">Except now we have learned some things from talking to people from the Front d'action populaire en réaménagement urbain, or FRAPRU. Two weeks ago, at the summit on homelessness, we learned that there is apparently a fourth phase, but the criteria have been changed. They have added an affordability factor that is really scaring organizations in Quebec. In other words, it appears that the nature of the rapid housing initiative, which is a very good program, is going to change. No one knows how much money is still in the fund, but the criteria have already changed. This is very scary for people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778123">I have a message for my Conservative friends: The Government of Canada's rapid housing initiative is a very good program. They should renew it if they come to power.</ParaText>

The numbers are just as staggering across Canada.</ParaText>

Many come from the local Treaty 1 nations and are on their very own Treaty 1 lands. Many of those who are currently houseless live in my riding. I have talked to different elected officials about how tragic it is that, on the very lands that we occupy, the folks who are the stewards, the people from those lands and territories, are not even housed on their own territory, the very lands, territories and resources that have allowed this country to be rich. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778140">The federal government issued an apology to our nation a few months back for calling us squatters on our very own lands. There is incremental justice in dealing with this. What is so disturbing about that goes back to what I said about all the riches in Canada and all the wealth that has occurred. Sometimes, when I am talking about issues of social justice and human rights, I wish I could dress up like a pipeline because that is the Conservatives' main focus, the very riches, the tar sands. They are reaping the benefits of indigenous lands, yet so many of our people live unsheltered in urban centres and on our lands, territories and resources.</ParaText>

The NDP fought for and got a for indigenous, by indigenous housing strategy with $4 billion issued to this particular housing fund. Where is the money? How much money have the provincial governments made off of our resources? The extraction industry is based in our communities and wreaks havoc on our lands in places like Beaver Lake Cree Nation, which is putting forward a precedent-setting case to talk about the long-term impacts of the tar sands on the treaty right to hunt and fish. That $4 billion is not even enough to begin to address the housing crisis on reserve. Where is the money?</ParaText>

She gave me all the tools I needed to be successful in life. She chose through her whole pregnancy not to drink and for that, I will always love her.” When they removed her lung, which was the last surgery that finally ended her life, they said, “Miss Warren,” because she married one of the fellows along the way, “we found an ashtray with a cigarette butt in it.” She had a hard life.</ParaText>

However, we are many years out from the national inquiry, and the Liberal government has implemented two calls for justice. Housing is a critical piece of this. If we want to deal with gender-based violence, whether it relates to indigenous women, gender-diverse people or any person, we have to deal with housing.

              <ParaText id="8778185"> Mr. Speaker, I will tell members when things stopped improving; it was when we put in place the Indian Act. It was bad from the start and it is still bad, because that is what we call legislated racism: the Indian Act. The fact is that even I, as a woman under the Indian Act right now, do not have the same rights as other women, never mind as men. As well, we still have not amended the Indian Act, and we talk about amending it incrementally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778186"> It impacts the safety of women. In fact, it was only less than 20 years ago that the Divorce Act was amended so women who were getting divorced on reserve had property rights. I am divorced, happily. However, if I had been living on a reserve at the time I divorced, I would have zero property rights. That is called legislated racism, which has been perpetuated in the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778190">Tonight, we are speaking about the report, “The Effects of the Housing Shortage on Indigenous Peoples in Canada”. Obviously, we know how important housing is and having a roof over one's head here in this country that we live in. Frankly, all over the world, we are grappling with housing issues, but more so for indigenous communities here at home. We need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to assist all folks here in Canada and to build this nation-to-nation relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778191">We wish to thank the Auditor General for her work and welcome the important recommendations in the report. Of course, as a government, we accept and will implement every recommendation that has been made by the Auditor General. As we all know, decades of underinvestment, discrimination and racism has led to a tremendous lack of safe, affordable housing and housing supports for indigenous peoples. We, as a government, have been taking action and will continue to take action to support indigenous peoples no matter where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778192">Since 2016, we have increased funding for on-reserve housing by 1,100%. We supported the construction, renovation and retrofit of over 34,000 homes in first nations communities. We are also working with first nations partners to co-develop a 10-year housing infrastructure strategy. If my memory serves me correctly, I think it was in one of the last two budgets that we committed, I believe, $4 billion to indigenous housing and the northern strategy on housing, which is very important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778193">All levels of government have a role to play to solve this crisis and create tangible, lasting, indigenous-led solutions to address these housing gaps. It is so important that we do so. One of the things that I think differentiates parties and their philosophical views in terms of how we approach and collaborate with different levels of government is that, on our side of the House, we wish to work and will continue to work with municipalities. In the area I live in, there is the City of Vaughan, the Region of York, the Province of Ontario and the federal government. We will continue to respect the jurisdictions within that space. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778194">As members know, cities in Canada, under the Constitution, are called “creatures of the province”. We can work directly with them at the federal level, but we should always respect them and collaborate, as we have with the housing accelerator fund. In the city of the Vaughan, for example, we made an investment of $59 million in the housing accelerator fund. One of the tranches of that housing accelerator fund in the city of Vaughan has been put to use in an infrastructure investment that will allow the acceleration, I believe, of 3,300 homes in the city of Vaughan to be built quicker and on schedule. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778195">As I am speaking about the city I live in, and as one of the members of Parliament there, I respect greatly all of the City of Vaughan's employees, from the planning department to bylaw, to parks, to animal control. Everyone who works at the City of Vaughan, all of the municipal employees there, do a fantastic job. In no way are council members or the planning department gatekeepers. They work hard. They issue permits, and it is up to the builders to build the houses afterwards. However, they issue their permits, and that is something I am very proud of. I want to give a shout-out to them, because not all political leaders respect our municipal politicians, at whatever level of government they may be at, and that is a shame.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778196">Again, with respect to the City of Vaughan council, mayor, and all the employees of the City of Vaughan, I have their backs. I know the hard work they do. I wish to say thank you and I hope the other MPs who represent the City of Vaughan would admonish the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation> for taking direct shots at our mayors, at the local councillors and at the folks who work in the planning departments with urban planning degrees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778197"> In both indigenous and non-indigenous communities in this beautiful country, before people can build a house, they need to have sewer, they need to have pipes and they need to have the infrastructure put in place. That requires planning. It does not just happen overnight. It requires collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778198"> We have been there for cities across this country. When it comes to continuing to invest in indigenous peoples, we will take no lessons, absolutely none, from the Conservative Party of Canada and its <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation>, who we know in the past has made disparaging remarks. That is on the record and a fact. When the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for housing, his $300-million boondoggle program only managed to get 99 homes built in first nations communities. During marathon votes, Conservatives voted against funding for housing projects for first nations, Inuit and Métis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778199">We know one of the Conservatives' promises is to reduce the GST on new builds. This is approximately $4.5 billion to $5 billion of a promise of expenditure. They promised to increase pensions for seniors from 65 to 74. That is another $4-billion promise. As such, on both sides, there would be a $9-billion spend. Whether it is reducing taxes on one or increasing spending on the other, there is a $9-billion promise that has not been accounted for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778200"> In order to do that, we would have to eliminate a couple of different programs, like the national early learning and child care program or the Canadian dental care plan, which now has three million Canadians covered, including nearly 25,000 in the riding I represent. We cannot cut CBSA officers again, like the Conservatives did in the prior government, and then say our borders are secure having made these devastating cuts, which we have had to rebuild. The Conservative plan is to make cuts and these cuts would have real-life impacts on indigenous communities, and we cannot go back to the years of shortchanging indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778201"> We will continue as a government to support projects that support first nations' leading the path forward. In my last two minutes, I will give a few examples of indigenous-led housing projects.

In fact, the City of Penticton, where I was a councillor, recently increased its development cost charges, something I disagree with. In the next order of business, it actually applied for the housing accelerator, which the government has put forward, on a promise that it would look to lower development cost charges.

              <ParaText id="8778229">The Conservatives have raised housing today in two different ways. First, they raised it on the overall housing crisis facing the country. Second, they raised the matter of housing in indigenous communities and in urban areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778230">I begin with the second addition. The Conservatives moved a concurrence motion on the report of the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, and they are perfectly fine to do that; they have the right to do that. However, I take issue with their record and their sincerity on the matter, to be frank. I say that with all due respect. I see Conservative members regularly raising such matters but not looking back to the previous government. That is not an irrelevant point; nothing happened during those years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778231">When the current government took office in 2015, we put in place a number of measures, especially investments, to address the plight and uplift the position of indigenous peoples. There is much more work to do in this regard, of course, but we have seen that 34,000 units of housing in first nations communities have either been newly built or repaired. My hon colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278684" Type="2">Vaughan—Woodbridge</Affiliation>, just explained this; he is still in the chamber. That is not nothing; that is an important result and one that, as I said, we need to continue to add to. There is much more work to do in this regard, but it is a very important starting point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778232">We can add to that, of course, the housing-enabling infrastructure. In budget 2024 alone, a few months back, we saw close to $1 billion put forward specifically for indigenous communities to ensure that vital connections, whether roads, bridges or water systems, are connected to housing. Sometimes I would like to remind my Conservative colleagues of this before they make claims that would have the effect of cancelling infrastructure programs, but I digress: It is vital to have infrastructure because we cannot have housing or communities without it. When the Conservatives raise these points on housing in indigenous communities, it is important to remind them that they would, in fact, cancel the very infrastructure needed to make those housing commitments and those communities possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778233">What do we also see? We see an urban, rural and northern indigenous housing strategy, the first of its kind in Canadian history. The NDP is right to continue to raise this point; I know it is critical to them, and I think it is critical to every member of Parliament in the House who believes in this kind of a vision. It would allow the federal government to work with organizations based in different parts of the country in urban, rural and northern areas and put in place more housing for indigenous peoples. It is an ongoing commitment, one we take very seriously and one that, it has to be said, has not been lived up to. It will not be lived up to until indigenous people in every part of this country are housed. Until we have addressed that, the challenge remains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778234">I will also speak to the matter of the main motion that was introduced today by the Conservatives on housing in general. I am the first to admit that we do not have a housing challenge in front of us; we have a housing crisis. We have to call it what it is. However, I also need to emphasize that the Conservative record on this is dismal. It is a point about credibility. I am not insensitive to the point that the Conservatives have raised about the Harper years. That goes back. However, it speaks to credibility. It is relevant to raise this because, when the current <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">opposition leader</Affiliation> was housing minister during those years, we saw 800,000 units of housing lost and only six affordable housing units built. It is not really serious.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8778235"> If the Conservatives had a record on housing to speak of that was credible or if they had a record on housing we could look to that had real results, then I would be much more sympathetic. I hope everyone will forgive me if I do not have much sympathy for the Conservative position on this because they did not care about it then, and I would say they do not care about it now. Why do they not care about it now? The motion talks about, among other things, homelessness, which is certainly a huge issue in our communities. It is an issue in my community of London and in communities across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778236">The Conservatives, by raising this, fail to recognize one other key point, which is that they have had the opportunity to raise this matter and present real options, real solutions, a real path forward to address homelessness, but they have never done it. Instead, the Conservative members of Parliament frequent encampments, for example, make videos in front of encampments and then post them on social media for political purposes. If they were serious about a vision on housing and homelessness, then they would certainly present a tangible idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778237">Homelessness exists. It is present. We need solutions to get people housed, to get them out of tents and into homes. This government put $250 million forward in the most recent budget. We have asked interested provinces to match that, and almost all have; Ontario and Saskatchewan are still outliers. That funding will allow for local communities to, as I say, get people out of tents, get them sheltered and, ultimately, get them into housing. That should be the vision. The Conservatives have never put something forward like this at all. They are very quick to make the videos I just talked about, but do nothing serious when it comes to homelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778238">The other matter that is raised in the motion relates to rent. Rent prices are far too high because vacancy rates are too low. We cannot have vacancy rates at or around zero, as they are in many communities, and not expect to have a consequent rise in the cost of rent. A healthy vacancy rate, as most economists and other housing experts will say, is between 3% and 5%. The question is how we get there. There are many ways to get there, but we have to incent builders. Builders have to be a part of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778239">This is where I part company with the NDP, in fact. Builders can be a partner in the response to the housing crisis. That is why we lifted GST on the construction costs of apartments for the middle class and lower-income Canadians. We see a record amount of building now when it comes to the issuing of permits for apartment construction. There are cranes across different communities. In my own community, there are cranes in the sky everywhere we go and in other communities. It is because of this incentive that has been provided to that sector in the context of high interest rates, high construction costs and high labour costs. We needed to do this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778240">Finally, broader systemic change is needed to incent more building in this country. Unless we have more building, there will still be high prices, whether it is for renters or for prospective homeowners. What has the government done? We have put forward the housing accelerator fund, which is a very important program. Why? It leads to the systemic changes that we all know are standing in the way of more affordable options being built. Zoning, for example, stands as the single biggest impediment in this country and others, in fact, to getting more homes built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778241">In exchange for municipalities making those commitments to allow for more building, zoning changes, in other words, the federal government is willing to partner with municipalities to have funding for housing, infrastructure, community centres and other basic needs, but they need to make the zoning changes. In fact, we have now partnered with close to 180 communities, large and small, to ensure that they are doing just that, making those vital changes, so that in neighbourhoods, for example, there are not only single-family homes, which are a great option if one can afford it, but duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, mid-rise apartments, row houses, the example of the missing middle that housing economists have talked about. This is how these changes are made, and it is happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778242">In communities across Canada, councils are putting in place these vital changes to zoning that are going to create the systemic change needed to allow for more housing affordability. However, what do we see? The Conservatives have opposed it every step of the way. </ParaText>

The announcement was about a project that used three different federal programs: the enabling accessibility fund, some CMHC funding and a reaching home grant.

When we talk about housing, we are ultimately talking about people's fundamental basic needs, their fundamental rights being respected and lived up to. How do we do that? We do not do it on our own.

The reality is successive Liberal and Conservative governments have not done that. When the Paul Martin Liberal government ended the national housing program, it created misery right across the country. Liberals promised every election they would do something, and so did Conservatives. Neither party did until the NDP gave the Liberals a backbone and an ultimatum and said that they had to reinvest in housing. It was the same thing with dental care and pharmacare. It was the same thing with all of these important programs that help people meet their basic needs. My question is very simple: Why do Liberals never do it on their own? They only do it when the NDP forces them to. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778253"> Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government is decimating Canada's middle class. I would like to share the story of a resident in Durham region to help illustrate exactly how Liberal policies are hurting our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778254">I met a man who has experienced what one might call invisible homelessness. Many people know him but did not know that he did not have a place to live. He was living with his mother, and their incomes together allowed them to be able to afford rent. When his mother had to be put in a long-term care facility, his income alone was no longer able to keep a roof over his head. He wound up moving into his car and sleeping in the parking lot of the ONroute in Newcastle, Ontario, in Durham region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778255"> When I met him, he explained to me that he had done everything society had asked him to do. He went to school, got a job, worked hard and paid his taxes, yet when the time came when his family faced a crisis and an emergency, Liberal policies were not there for him. Liberal policies have let him and his family down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778256"> The problem in our country right now, or one problem of many, is that more and more Canadians are in precarious situations, where one bit of bad luck, one person getting sick, or one issue hitting a family, sideswiping people unexpectedly, can put them in a situation of great desperation. Housing is a key fundamental aspect of this, of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778257"> A recent survey from Habitat for Humanity showed that 82% of Canadians worry that the housing crisis is impacting our overall health and well-being, and 78% believe that the inability to own a home is contributing to the wealth gap in Canada. The numbers get even worse when we look at younger generations of Canadians, who have family members, friends and neighbours going through precarious situations. Then they see a government continuing to do photo op after photo op, advertising policies and programs that are supposedly able to fix the issues, but the government is instead entirely tone-deaf and unresponsive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778258">The numbers, again, speak for themselves. Let us look at what has been announced by the Liberal government and its buddies in the NDP. Let us look at Toronto, with $471 million announced for a housing photo op fund, and home building starts down 20%. In Vancouver, the NDP-Liberal photo op fund is $115 million, and the result is that home building starts are down 19%. In Kingston, the NDP-Liberal photo op fund is $27.6 million, but home building starts are down 67%. The NDP-Liberal photo op fund in Guelph is $21.4 million, with home building starts down 65%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778259">The government in this country has abdicated any responsibility for middle-class families and instead wants to tell people over over again that it is doing this and that, and that it is trying to solve the problems. It is spending more tax dollars, yet the result is more people struggling, more people worried they may never afford a home, and more people raising children who believe that home ownership is now only for those who are the wealthiest, that it is now a luxury. This is opposed to a time, not very long ago, when home ownership was a defined part of the Canadian dream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778260">I am trying my best to channel the frustrations and concerns of many of my constituents across Durham region who believe, fundamentally, that they are not the priority of the Liberal government. More numbers come out that affirm that Canadians are pessimistic about the government's ability to solve any of the serious problems in our country, to look out for the best interests of middle-class families and to address the very real crisis of our country's housing shortage.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8778275">Mr. Speaker, I am back again tonight to continue to call for action on the housing crisis we are in, in particular, to call for one very tangible action the government could take in the lead-up to the fall economic statement we now know is set to be announced a week from today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778276">I have been pressing for six specific items to be included in the fall economic statement, including this one on the housing crisis. I want to start, though, by sharing the extent of the crisis we are in and what it looks like in my community. First of all, when it comes to those who are living unsheltered, between 2018 and 2021, the number of folks living unsheltered tripled from just over 300 to just over 1,000. In the most recent three years, as we just had the point-in-time count study in my community completed a few weeks ago, it almost tripled again. The number of folks living unsheltered is now up to over 2,300, and that is likely an underestimation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778277">Meanwhile, house prices are eight times the median income today. Back in 2005, they were around three times the median annual income. This is because house prices have gone up almost 300%. Rents have doubled. Wages, meanwhile, have not caught up in any way; they have only gone up 42%. Meanwhile, in my community, research shows we are leading the country in the number of affordable housing units we are losing. We lose 39 units of previously affordable housing for every one new unit built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778278">When it comes to government investments in housing, it has gotten to the point where, in Ontario, 93% of affordable homes were built prior to 1995, back when both federal and provincial governments in Ontario and the federal government of various stripes invested in affordable housing at the scale required. It is part of why I have been pushing for a number of items, including doubling the social housing stock with ambitious federal investments, similar to what we used to see in the 1970s and even into the 1980s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778279">I have been calling to have the government fix the definition of housing that CMHC is using so that affordable housing dollars go towards building truly affordable housing, and for an end to the tax exemptions for large corporate landlords like real estate investment trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778280">Tonight, I want to speak specifically about this, because I know in the House there has been a lot of talk about Habitat for Humanity. Habitat for Humanity has one specific call. It wants to see parliamentarian support ending HST so it can build more affordable homes. Last fall, the government gave an HST exemption to for-profit developers of rental units, a helpful measure to address the housing crisis, but left out were non-profit, affordable, home ownership builders like Habitat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778281">In my community on Kehl Street, a Habitat home build site built 45 homes. It would have had an extra million had this measure been in place to build more affordable units. In fact, Habitat estimates that, for every 100 homes built, it could build an additional five to 20 homes if it was exempt from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778282">It is why I sent a letter about this, back on October 25, to the ministers of finance and housing. I asked about it in question period on November 1, but I did not get an answer then. I got a reply to my letter on November 12, directing me to ask the question of the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. I did that earlier today at the industry committee and did not receive an answer there either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778283">What I have put forward as well is that we could actually pay for this measure if only we got rid of that tax exemption for the REITs. If we had the REITs pay their fair share, this is what we could use to pay for removing the HST for Habitat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778284">Will the parliamentary secretary at least share where the government stands on this important measure?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8778285">Mr. Speaker, let me begin by focusing on what we agree on. I have a lot of respect for my colleague, in large part because he always raises issues related to vulnerable Canadians. He began his speech by talking about those who are unhoused. We have in place a government that hears him, that sees the issue in Canada and is responding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778286">A few moments ago, I talked about encampments in Canada and how the federal government has put $250 million toward ensuring that people are taken out of camps, sheltered and ultimately put into stable housing. There are other examples I could point to relating specifically to the issue the member raised. I am not unsympathetic to the idea that we need to support not-for-profits, and we do. We do in a variety of ways, like through low-interest loans, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778287">The member talked about initiatives in his home community. In my community of London, I am thinking about the Vision SoHo project, a great housing project that is going to see hundreds of people housed. This includes people who have very difficult and acute needs, people who have experienced deep trauma, physical abuse, sexual abuse and trauma that has led to them being on the street and addicted to all sorts of unfortunate things. When it comes to drug or alcohol addiction, the wraparound supports are available. The organizations that made this possible secured a low-interest loan of around 3%. That is not uncommon. Working with CMHC, not-for-profits can do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778288">What not-for-profits can also do by working with the federal government is obtain access to grants. Grants allow for housing to be built. I emphasize “built” because that is what the federal government takes care of. We work on the capital side, ensuring that homes are built. We do ask, and I look to provinces especially on this, for the operating dollars when it comes to supportive housing for people facing those particular challenges. Of course, not-for-profits are taking care of the ultimate administration and execution of these programs, and municipalities have a role to play too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778289">The member talked about the high cost of rent. Of course, we know that is an issue in Canada and we lifted GST costs on the construction of apartments. We did so for a specific reason. Interest rates, labour costs and construction costs have been very high. We needed to do it, and now we see cranes across the country building homes for Canadians. If we add to supply, we bring down costs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778290">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the <Affiliation DbId="311618" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> for adding some substance to this conversation. I think that is what debate in Parliament is supposed to be about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778291">However, it continues to be the case that I do not understand how the government, when it removed GST from for-profit builders of rental housing, just forgot there were other non-profit affordable home ownership builders like Habitat. Habitat has come around and shared this oversight with the government. I think that would be a kind assessment. Maybe it was an oversight. The government recognizes we are in a housing crisis. Non-profit affordable home ownership builders like Habitat are ready and waiting to build more, likely in the member's community and certainly in mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778292">Now that the government understands this, and Habitat has met with it as well, why is it not more obvious that this measure is important to take up? Why have we not seen it done yet?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8778293">Mr. Speaker, there are different ways to get to the same results, the results we all want. I talked about low-interest loans. A low-interest loan to a not-for-profit of around 3% is very significant considering the current economic context. I talked about grants that are available, and they certainly are, through the affordable housing program and other initiatives of this federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778294">I talked about how the GST lift, taking GST off the construction costs of apartments, will add to supply. We have vacancy rates in this country hovering around 0% in many communities. That is unacceptably low. We need a vacancy rate between 3% and 5%. With high interest rates, we needed to do something to incent the private sector. That has done it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8778295">If I had more time, I would have talked about the housing accelerator fund and the systemic change it is leading to by zoning changes and other things to make home ownership a real opportunity. We have more to do, but I am excited about the prospects ahead because we are serious about this.</ParaText>
