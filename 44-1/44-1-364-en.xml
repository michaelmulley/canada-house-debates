              <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">Mr. Rick Perkins (South Shore—St. Margarets, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8664782"> Mr. Speaker, once again, happy birthday yesterday, plus one. It is always a happy day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664783">I normally would be pleased, and I am always pleased, to rise in this place, even when it concerns a $400-million Liberal scandal. For those who are watching and just tuning in, perhaps I could recap. We are in the 66th hour of a Liberal filibuster on the refusal to provide documents to the House of Commons. This was demanded in June and voted on by a majority of members of Parliament, representing a majority of Canadians, in terms of the $400-million scandal identified by the Auditor General with regard to the Liberal green slush fund. Hand-picked directors of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> funnelled that money to companies they own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664784">Just to give us some perspective, the Liberal filibuster began at the end of September. It is the longest in parliamentary history. The previous one, over yet another Liberal scandal, was only 16 hours. This issue has seized the House simply because the Liberals are redacting, as it is called, documents ordered by the House. What is redaction? Redaction means that they are censoring them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664785">The House of Commons ordered the production of documents on this scandal. Over 10,000 pages were provided. Most of them went through a lot of black ink toner cartridge because there was so much blacked out in them. They had to bring in new photocopiers in the PMO. This was ordered by the PMO, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own department, to breach the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664786">The Speaker found what is called a prima facie case of privilege. What that means, for those watching, is that the ultimate authority above everything else is the House of Commons' ability to order documents to be provided by government, to hold the Crown, the cabinet, to account for its actions. The cabinet is defying it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664787">What could we do with $400 million instead of funnelling it to Liberal insider companies as the Liberals have done? I will get into it. I am sure that it is not $400 million. I may be mistaken. It may be closer to $700 million, and I will explain that in a minute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664788">What we could do in my province of Nova Scotia with $400 million is build a thousand homes. However, the priority of the Liberals was to funnel it to their own companies so that they could enrich themselves while Canadians line up in record numbers at food banks and while people in my riding have to live in trailers and campers in camping parks because they cannot find housing. Those thousand houses that could have been built with that $400 million in Nova Scotia would be enormously helpful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664789">I will just tell us how extensive this cover-up is. We had the architect of the Liberal green slush fund, former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains, in the industry committee this week. Some may remember him. He was the industry minister for the Liberals from 2015 to 2021. He directly appointed all the corrupt Liberal insiders to this board, who then funnelled money to their companies. At committee, we asked him some pretty straightforward and simple questions. If I could, I will read from Hansard from the committee meeting this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664790">I asked a simple question of former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains. I asked him where he worked. He said, “As I've indicated, the topic I was asked to speak on was Sustainable Development Technology Canada”. Again, I asked where he worked. He said it was on the public record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664791">Indeed, it is on the public record. While he was industry minister, he was responsible for lowering cellphone fees. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave him the mandate. We all know that we have the most expensive cellphone costs in the world, according to international studies. Can we guess who former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains works for? He was too embarrassed to say, or perhaps those at Rogers ordered him not to say it at committee because they were too embarrassed to have him mention their name and that he worked there. However, he works for Rogers, which is the most expensive cellphone company in the world. He just kept saying that it is on the public record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664792">He was a good Liberal who always followed the talking points from the PMO. I suspect that he was following talking points from Rogers saying to please not associate Rogers, this most expensive cellphone company, with the Liberal corruption scandal that he was in charge of.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8664793">We had testimony from the former chair whom Navdeep Bains appointed, who he was warned had a conflict. He said to her, and to everyone in SDTC, that it was okay and they would manage the conflict. They managed the conflict of that money into their companies. The former minister himself said that was okay. That appointee, Annette Verschuren, said in committee that she never applied for any job in her life. She said Navdeep Bains called her twice to talk her into running, putting in an application and becoming the chair of the board. She said, even though he knew she was conflicted, he called her twice. I asked him if he called her twice, because that is what she testified to, and he said he did not remember.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664794">Then I said the former CEO of the Liberal green slush fund testified before the committee that former minister Bains called her and told her to vet the candidate. She said they could not have this person as a candidate for chair because SDTC did business with her companies. If she were picked, she would be the first chair in the 20-year history of SDTC who had a conflict. Bains said it was okay and to ask her if she wanted to do it. He was warned again. Whether we believe it or not, there was actually somebody who worked in the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office, who was doing communications in a nice patronage job in the Liberal green slush fund. She warned the minister's office that he should not appoint this person because of the conflict. It was still ignored. This was not some mistake or some hands-off occurrence where they did not know what was going on because they are an incompetent minister who does not follow anything in their department. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664795">I then asked Navdeep Bains if he remembered going to cabinet to get another $750 million of taxpayer money for the Liberal green slush fund. He said it was in the budget. I said that the things in the budget have to have the minister's approval. I asked if it had his approval, but he did not remember. We have a Liberal who does not remember giving away $750 million of taxpayer money. I guess that is just pocket change for the Liberals. It is either that or he was just unwilling to admit that he was part of this scheme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664796">We have asked, in those documents, for all the documents from the department that the former minister ran, the industry department. Can we guess which department has not complied with the whole order? It is the industry department. Can we guess which department has the most blacked-out and censored documents? It is the industry department. It is rivalled only by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the Privy Council Office, which has also refused to give the truth about its documents. An incredible cover-up is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664797">The way to solve this and break the Liberal filibuster against giving up the documents is for them to give them up without redactions. It is the easiest way for the House to get back to dealing with the issues that Canadians are concerned about, such as the doubling of housing costs, with mortgages and rent, and the tripling of the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre. Is everybody aware that the Liberals plan to increase the carbon tax? I can just see the Liberals' campaign slogan now: “Re-elect us and we will put taxes up to 61¢ a litre.” I think it is a winner. We can just ask Joe Clark how that worked out for him in 1980.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664798">We have a group of Liberals who are so desperate to cover up all the emails between former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains and the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who has been responsible for the Liberal green slush fund for 45 months. They are trying to hide those documents. They have kept the House from getting to the business of actually dealing with issues for three months: September, October and into November as of today. We must hold the government to account for failing to deal with two million people a month going to food banks in Canada, for tripling the carbon tax, for increasing the cost of food and for its massively unsuccessful housing decelerator fund, in which it has spent billions of dollars to hire bureaucrats and not built a single house.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8664799">We could get to those things if the Liberals would stop filibustering and obey the House order of a democratically elected Parliament. As has been the case for over 400 years, when the House asks for something, the government is compelled to give it. It must really be bad for them to delay what they think is their priority legislation and to continue their filibuster on releasing the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664800">We all know that we would like the House to get on to the plan of fixing the budget. We have a <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> who has never met a target, nor did her predecessor, former minister “Bill no more”. They have never met a target. She said that the government was going to keep it to a $40-billion deficit, as if it were some sort of a challenge to spend only $40 billion more than the taxes it takes in. She could not even do that. She is over by $8 billion already, and we are not even through the year. We can imagine what it is going to be in the spring, when the final numbers come in about the incompetence of the government's financial ability. Maybe that is why it is delaying the release of the documents, so it cannot be held to account for its incompetence on fixing the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664801">Now let us talk about the government's inability to build homes. It brags about the billions of dollars in its housing accelerator fund, which has not built a house. That is why I call it the “decelerator” fund. My home province is Nova Scotia. The <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> is from Nova Scotia, but we would not know it. Maybe we would, because he gave $30 million of housing decelerator money to the City of Halifax. How many houses did it build? It built zero. How many people did it hire? It hired 30 more urban planners to make sure it could slow the housing process down. That is why it is the housing decelerator fund. The government is refusing to release the documents on the green slush fund so that it cannot be held to account for its ineptitude on housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664802">We know that crime has massively gone up. In the city of Toronto, in the large cities and even in Nova Scotia, we are seeing the massive thefts of cars. People are being told by the Toronto police to just leave their keys by the door so that thieves do not come in and maybe harm them. They are told to let them take their car because that would be easier than them enforcing the law. What would be easier to ensure that this does not happen is to not let people who are charged with the theft of automobiles, who have been convicted time after time, out on bail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664803">The other election slogan of the government, other than that it will raise the tax to 61¢ a litre, will be to re-elect it so it can allow more criminals on the streets. However, it does not want us discussing those issues in the House. That is why it is not releasing the documents. It needs to stop the crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664804">Let us not forget about the tax that is putting the price of everything up: the carbon tax. We believe it should axe the tax, but the government does not want to be held to account for that. Here is what happens. For 20 years, I worked in retail. I can tell members that, when one buys a good from somebody who has to manufacture it, producing that good takes a lot of energy. When it takes a lot of energy, there is a carbon tax on that, which increases the price of buying that good. One of the biggest costs in retail is the cost to transport that good from where it was made to our stores. Can members guess what is used to transport it? It is diesel and gas, not sailboats or bicycles. We cannot use the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>'s bicycles to truck a container of rum to Nova Scotia; it has to come by truck or boat. That fuel gets taxed, which increases the price. Of course, when one operates 100 or 1,000 mass market retail stores across Canada, can we guess what one's number one cost is besides labour? It is not the rent; it is paying for the energy to operate that store. Because the energy costs are there, the carbon tax is put on that. When we tax the manufacturer or the grower, tax the transportation and tax the retailer, can we guess what happens? The price of everything goes up. According to Dalhousie University, 84% of Canadians say that food is the number one thing they have seen go up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664805">This Liberal filibuster could end and we could get on to dealing with these issues if the Liberals would stop covering up their green slush fund and release the unredacted documents.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8664806">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentioned “filibuster” several times. I just looked it up and the definition of filibuster is “an action such as a prolonged speech that obstructs progress in a legislative assembly while not technically contravening the required procedures.” The only people I see speaking here are the Conservatives, so it is the Conservatives who are filibustering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664807"> The member also mentioned rents. A recent report showed that in Toronto, in August, rent was down 7% compared to the same month in 2023. Maybe the Conservatives do not want to discuss the Bloomberg-Nanos research that showed this week that the consumer confidence index in Canada is at a 30-month high. Maybe the Conservatives do not want to discuss the recent StatsCan report that showed inflation came down 1.6%. Maybe the Conservatives do not want to discuss the Bank of Canada cutting the interest rate for the fourth consecutive time, the first G7 country to do so, to 3.75%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664808">Maybe the Conservatives do not want to discuss all the positive reports coming out as they are filibustering here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664809">Mr. Speaker, the member for Nepean sits on the industry committee with me and does ask thoughtful questions at committee, but unfortunately that was not one of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664810">The reason it was not one of them is that for things to go down, they have to have gone up. Under these Liberals, interest rates soared because they have doubled the debt of the country and because they put too much money into the economy through their deficit spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664811"> The member also mentioned that rent has gone down 7% in Toronto. Rent has gone up 100% in Toronto, but the Liberals are proud that it has gone down 7%. I am thrilled that the member for Nepean thinks that a 93% rent increase is some sort of great record to go to an election on. I am looking forward to the Toronto MP saying, “Re-elect us, rent only went up 93%.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664819">However, there is something else that Quebeckers remember. When the Conservative Party was in power, a question of privilege was raised regarding documents on the treatment of Afghan detainees. Do members know how long that question of privilege was before the House? It was before the House for five months. For five months, the Harper government at the time refused to turn over the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664820">I would like my colleague to explain that. He is trying to sell us on the merits of his party, but how can Quebeckers trust that party today when it broke their trust for five months by refusing to hand over documents? I am, of course, referring to the Conservative Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664821">Mr. Speaker, it is a great question in the context of the early excuse that the Liberals used for not turning over the documents in the green slush fund. They came up with a fake charter argument, saying that the only way documents could be turned over to the RCMP was if the RCMP went to court, which is one way in a police investigation. However, the other way is when someone owns or runs a business and discovers that perhaps something has happened to the money, that an employee has taken money from their company. The individual who owns or runs a business not only can turn that information and the documents over to the police, but is morally bound to do so. In this case, we, the House of Commons, on behalf of the taxpayer, own the SDTC foundation. The government is the owner of that business and therefore has the obligation to turn the documents over to the police.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664828">I am always amazed at how Conservatives, during their speeches regarding the cost of living crisis, will ignore the elephant in the room. I have been on the agriculture committee, and if we look at the inputs that farmers are dealing with, we see that all of the major corporate sectors have seen record profits over the last number of years. Whether fertilizers, oil and gas, grocery retail, banking or real estate, all of those major corporate sectors have been doing very well. Where has that increase in net profits come from? It comes directly out of the wallets of the hard-working folks right across this country, including my riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford. Of course, when corporations unfairly raise those prices and increase those net profits, that is what leads to inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664829">Why is there this willful blindness to not talk about this particular issue? Is it because many of the corporate executives in those sectors making record profits somehow find themselves at Conservative leadership fundraisers?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664874">It is unfortunate that hundreds of millions of wasted taxpayer dollars means nothing to the Liberal government. We saw the indifference that the Liberals displayed when it was revealed that $56 million was wasted on the ArriveCAN app, an application that did not work.

              <ParaText id="8664877"> Now, for the benefit of my constituents and all Canadians who have been very curious about the issue, I will walk members through the timeline of this particular scandal. We know that Sustainable Development Technology Canada was a not-for-profit foundation that was established by the Government of Canada in 2001 through a special act of Parliament, the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664878"> SDTC was created to support and finance clean-technology start-ups, with the goal of delivering economic, environmental and health benefits to Canada. By all accounts, the fund ran well and had zero issues for 17 years, that is until Navdeep Bains, the former Liberal industry minister, decimated the fund and brought in an era of corruption. In late 2018, former minister Bains expressed concerns regarding the chair of SDTC, Jim Balsillie, given his public criticism of the Liberal government's privacy legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664879"> Jim Balsillie is a widely respected Canadian businessman who is the former chair and CEO of BlackBerry. He was appointed as chair of SDTC in 2013, during the Harper government, for a term of five years. However, in 2018, the office of then Liberal minister of industry, Navdeep Bains, expressed discomfort about Balsillie's comments with the CEO of SDTC and requested that the chair stop criticizing government legislation. Minister Bains proposed two replacement chairs to the CEO of SDTC in a phone call. One of the candidates proposed was Annette Verschuren, an entrepreneur who was already already receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8664880">The minister, the PMO and the PCO were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair, and they were told that up until that point the fund had never had a chair with interests in companies receiving funding from SDTC. In June 2019, Minister Bains decided to proceed with the appointment of Annette Verschuren despite repeated warnings expressed to his office. The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interests were tolerated and “managed” by board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664881">Board members went on to award SDTC funding to companies in which board members held stock or positions within the company receiving funding. Minister Bains went on to appoint two other controversial board members who engaged in unethical behaviour in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes. During this time, ISED officials sat in on the board meetings and witnessed 186 conflicts at the board but did not intervene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664882">That brings us to January 2021, when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278162" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation> became the new Minister of Industry, replacing Navdeep Bains after the latter decided not to run for re-election. In November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices at SDTC. The Privy Council was briefed by the whistle-blowers about the allegations shortly after and commissioned two independent reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664883"> In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> agreed to suspend SDTC funding. Finally, in June 2024, the Auditor General's report was released, finding severe governance failures at SDTC. The Auditor General found that there were 186 instances in which conflicts of interest occurred, meaning that the board of directors and the chair had hand-picked where funding was going. Some of that funding went to their own companies. The Auditor General took only a sampling of the funding and found that 82% of that sampling was in a conflict of interest, totalling $330 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664884">The Auditor General also found that SDTC did not follow conflict of interest policies in 90 cases, spent nearly $76 million on projects connected to the Liberals' friends appointed to run the fund, spent $59 million on projects that were not allowed to have been awarded any money, and spent $12 million on projects that were both in conflict of interest and were ineligible for funding. In one instance, the hand-picked chair of the fund gave a shocking $217,000 to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664885">In response to the damning findings, in June, Conservatives put forward a motion calling on the government to provide to the House documents pertaining to SDTC. The motion included provisions for the documents to then be provided to the RCMP so it could undertake a criminal investigation on whether criminal offences were committed. The Liberal government has refused to hand over the documents, and that is why we are still here discussing the motion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664886">I would now like to share some of the testimony that the SDTC whistle-blower gave at committee. I find the testimony to be astounding and I commend the witness for their bravery. The whistle-blower stated:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think the Auditor General's investigation was more of a cursory review. I don't think the goal and mandate of the Auditor General's office is to actually look into criminality, so I'm not surprised by the fact that they haven't found anything criminal. They're not looking at intent. If their investigation was focused on intent, of course they would find the criminality.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8664894">It is because of brave whistle-blowers such as this individual that the public was able to see the corruption and rot that the Liberal government had allowed to fester at SDTC. Conservatives commend this individual and thank him for standing up for Canadians. As I just mentioned, this brave whistle-blower believes that criminal intent would be found if the documents the Conservatives have requested were to be handed over to the RCMP. That is why it is so important that the Liberal government comply with the House order and release the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664895">In closing, we are still here today discussing this issue after a month because the government refuses to comply with an order of the House. We are calling on the government to comply with the House's order and hand over the documents unredacted. Then we can find out what really went on and whether there was any criminality, which former employees at SDTC believe there was. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664896">I will end by saying that, after nine years of the Liberal government, there has never been a better time to be a Liberal insider. Under the Liberal government, Liberal insiders feel it is perfectly acceptable to waste $400 million of taxpayer funds while Canadians are struggling. This is a slap in the face to the people in my riding of Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte who are struggling to make ends meet under the costly NDP-Liberal coalition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664897">Just this week, Karen Shuh, the executive director of the Barrie Food Bank, stated that the food bank is now supporting upward of 7,000 people per month, 37% of whom are children. Ms. Shuh went on to say, “As demand continues to rise, we face increasing challenges in keeping up, often needing to make difficult choices about which foods to cut in order to stretch our donations further.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664898">Canadians in my community are visiting food banks in record numbers because the Liberal government's inflationary taxes and spending are driving up the cost of everything, and instead of providing Canadians with the relief they deserve, the Liberal government plans to hike the carbon tax again. This costly carbon tax is not only affecting families but also farmers in my community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664899">I was recently sent an Enbridge bill for almost $10,000 from a farmer in my riding who runs a poultry operation. Their bill shows a carbon tax charge of $2,700 on the cost of fuel to dry grain corn. Shockingly, the carbon tax is actually more than the value of the gas before delivery and global adjustments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664900">Moving to the poultry side of their operation, this farm pays a comparable tax on the cost to heat their barns. Every 24 weeks, they place over 3,000 day-old breeder chicks in their barns. These barns need to be heated to 32°C as the chicks are so small they cannot heat themselves. This temperature is slowly reduced as the chicks grow stronger. The cost to heat the barns during this placement is approximately $7,000, with approximately a third of that cost being the carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664901">During this affordability crisis, one would think that the Liberals would think twice about allowing Liberal insiders to funnel $400 million to their buddies. Unfortunately, they see no issue with this corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664902">I have heard from countless businesses in my riding that have suffered due to inflation, labour shortages, supply chain issues, increasing business debt and federal tax increases. It is devastating to see these businesses, which bring joy to so many members of my community, suffer under the Liberal government's punitive policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664903">However, Canadians have something to look forward to. They can look forward to voting for a common-sense Conservative government as the costly NDP stops propping up its government partners and calls a carbon tax election. In this carbon tax election, Canadians would have the opportunity to vote for Conservatives, who would axe the tax, build the homes and fix the budget to bring down inflation and interest rates to make it affordable again for our seniors and all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664904">To those watching at home, I say that help is on the way. Once we have a carbon tax election, a common-sense Conservative government would axe the tax on everything, for everyone, everywhere, to bring home powerful paycheques and lower prices for all Canadians. </ParaText>

Due to our actions during the last two years, the trend of inflation is coming down so much. It has come down to 1.6% below the target range of the Bank of Canada. Every other country has had to raise interest rates to combat inflation, but we are the first G7 country to cut interest rates for the fourth consecutive time and have brought it down to 3.75%. Consequently, the Canadian consumer confidence index is at a 30-month high. I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664935">Mr. Speaker, today is All Saints' Day, a tradition shared by many European cultures and various churches, especially the Catholic, Orthodox and Apostolic traditions. Central to this holy day is remembering all the saints and any believer who has accepted the Christian faith through Jesus Christ. Tradition calls us to visit cemeteries at sundown, to light candles and lay flowers, and to pray and share memories of those departed. For some Polish Canadians, we will share small loaves of bread called <I>powalki</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664936">In our overly busy and distracting digital world, it is about taking a moment to stop and remember and cherish our ancestors. This year, as in the past, my family will remember our daughter Lucy-Rose, who passed in 2018, and join the many families across Canada who continue to grieve for their lost children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664937">I wish every Canadian marking All Saints' Day a solemn and devout observance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8664938">Mr. Speaker, 1984 is a year ingrained in the psyche of Sikhs across the world. Forty years ago this week, Sikhs were hunted across India by government-orchestrated mobs in a week-long genocidal campaign of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664939">The streets of Delhi saw Sikh families being identified by the use of voter lists, resulting in families being burned alive and women facing horrific forms of violence. The world saw Indian politicians and celebrities openly supporting and celebrating the massacre of Sikhs. This was followed by forced disappearances at the hands of the state and law enforcement, and the continued persecution and targeting of India's Sikh community. Unfortunately, 40 years later, justice for the survivors and victims continues to be denied. Instead, those officials who took part have been protected and awarded medals of honour for their roles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8664940">We remember not only the thousands of Sikh families and children who were victims, but also the humanity of those who gave shelter to protect their Sikh friends during this horrific time. We will never forget 1984.</ParaText>

This is a major victory for patients like Sandra Demontigny, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. However, the battle is not yet won in terms of legal protection for doctors. The Collège des médecins du Québec reminded doctors on Wednesday that advance requests are still illegal under the Criminal Code.

In fact, if we look at coastal communities in British Columbia, we are putting forward a transition for farmed salmon in B.C. We are taking things seriously. We are not pontificating on what is wrong and making judgments. We are curious about what British Columbians need. What they need are good paying jobs.

              <ParaText id="8665199">Mr. Speaker, next I am tabling a petition highlighting a variety of concerns regarding human rights and abuses by the Government of Eritrea. Petitioners want the House to note first of all that Eritrea has been ruled by an authoritarian, brutal dictator under a totalitarian system for the last 30 years, with no constitution, no election, no parliament, no freedom of the press, and no freedom of movement and association. Although Eritrea gets less attention, it is generally known, as a result of this reality, as being the North Korea of Africa in terms of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665200">Eritreans continue to flee indefinite military conscription, religious persecution and political repression. Eritreans who have sought asylum around the world, including here in Canada, continue to be concerned about foreign interference, about how the Eritrean government through its embassies tries to undermine the human rights of people who have fled and interfere in the affairs of other sovereign countries. Various instances of this are highlighted in the petition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665201">In addition, petitioners want to draw the attention of the House to how the Eritrean dictator collaborates with Vladimir Putin and other adversaries, other authoritarian regimes around the world. Petitioners call on the House to take a number of steps to engage more with Eritrean human rights activists and pro-democracy groups, to take a leadership stand against the Eritrean dictator's malicious conspiracy with Vladimir Putin and to investigate instances of foreign interference in Canada involving the Eritrean regime, to ensure that people who are agents of the regime are not able to misuse our asylum system to come to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665202">Petitioners want stronger sanctions against human rights abusers who are associated with the Eritrean regime, and they also are calling for the release of various political prisoners, including imprisoned journalist Dawit Isaak, who is the longest-imprisoned journalist in the world, as well as various imprisoned Eritrean former parliamentarians: Petros Solomon, Mahmoud Ahmed Sheriffo, Haile Woldetensae, Ogbe Abraha, Hamad Hamid Hamad, Saleh Kekiya, Estifanos Seyoum, Berhane Gebregziabher, Aster Fissehatsion, Germano Nati and Beraki Gebreslassie.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665204"> Mr. Speaker, the next petition I am tabling raises concern about another proposal for the expansion of euthanasia. While there have been so many abuses already, with Canadians who are struggling with the cost of living, for example, being pushed toward considering this option, the focus of the government, rather than being on alleviating the suffering of Canadians, has been on trying to propose further expansion of the already most liberal euthanasia regime in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665205">Petitioners are raising concern about a proposal to expand euthanasia to include “babies from birth to one year of age”. The proposal for the legalized killing of infants, obviously without their consent, is deeply disturbing to many Canadians. It was a proposal made by Louis Roy of the Quebec college of physicians before a parliamentary committee. The petitioners would like to see the House soundly reject the proposal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665275">Another example is ArriveCAN. We asked for documents about ArriveCAN, but we did not get anything. We heard from witnesses in committee, including Kristian Firth, who refused to co-operate with the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. For that reason, he was brought before the bar of the House of Commons. Of course, Kristian Firth was a problem, but so was the government because it refused to hand over the documents. Unfortunately, many people have suffered because of this government's actions, which include refusing to hand over the documents. Obviously, Kristian Firth acted improperly when he chose to omit information, but one could argue that he was also a victim of the current government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665276">The government also refused to give us the relevant documents about the Winnipeg laboratory. That is another example of a case involving external affairs where we have not received the documents. We have not received the documents related to the two scientists. In this situation, it was a deputy minister, I believe, who had to appear in the House, where he was admonished by the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665277">In all these situations, there are people who bear some of the responsibility, but ultimately, the government is always responsible. It was the government that failed to hand over the relevant documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665278">The next example is the WE Charity scandal. We had requested the documents related to WE Charity. That is something I find really interesting. Most of the other scandals I have mentioned happened during this Parliament, with the exception of the Winnipeg lab scandal, which I believe happened in the last Parliament. As for the WE Charity scandal, I think that happened three Parliaments earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665279">The last example that I am going to give relates to the Governor General. We did not receive the documents in that regard. Unfortunately, there are a lot of examples of situations where the House did not receive the documents it requested. Even when all of the parties in the House adopt a motion to demand documents, unfortunately, we do not always get them, since we have a government that wants to stay in power, with the NDP, who wants the same thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665280">What I find the most difficult is not just the fact that we have not received the documents related to several different issues and situations. It is also the fact that the NDP continues to support this government when many Canadians are suffering and many Canadians want a carbon tax election to be called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665281">This is a really difficult time for the House, but also for Canada. Obviously, Canadians do not want to continue on the road that we are on. That includes Quebeckers. Everyone in Canada wants an election now, given the situation that they find themselves in. Canadians are no longer able to buy food since it is a lot more expensive than it was nine years ago. Unfortunately, we have heard many sad stories in the House about people who cannot put food on the table because of the interest rates under this government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665282">Think about young people who want to buy their first home. Right now, they are unable to buy a house because house prices are really high and they cannot afford the mortgage. Mortgages are unbelievable, both because of house prices and because of the rise in interest rates caused by the current government. Clearly, there are a lot of sad reasons and a lot of good reasons why Canadians want a chance to vote in a carbon-tax election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665283">There is also the issue of how much it costs to fill up one's car or truck. That is more expensive now, because of this NDP-Liberal government's carbon tax. These are truly expensive times for Canadians. The government says it is an expensive time for Canadians, but in fact, the government has created this particular period in time in Canadian history. Right now, a lot of things, almost all things, in fact, have become very expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665284">It seems that the government is incapable of handing over the documents or creating a good environment for Canadians, one they can live in. As I said before, everything—food, gas, home heating and house prices—is more expensive, too expensive, under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665285">Unfortunately, the economy is not the only thing that the government is incapable of managing. I have lots of other examples of things that the government is incapable of managing, including passports. We were once in a situation where the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> was incapable of managing passport production. It was a really tough time, right after the pandemic. A lot of Canadians wanted to travel but were grounded because they had not received their passports. This is another example of the government's lack of competence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665286">The same thing happened with forest fire management. The Jasper fires were a tragedy, especially because the government chose to ignore advice from scientists about the forest fire threat looming over Jasper. Unfortunately, this led to horrific, terrible forest fires. Once again, the government was at fault.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665290">Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I will do my best to stop moving my notes. Unfortunately, I have many files with lots examples of how this government has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665291">The next example I want to share of how the government has failed to assume its responsibilities involves the Governor General. As I mentioned, we had not received certain documents related to nearly $300,000 in expenses. I now have more information on that, but nothing specific about those costs. We therefore asked for a list of costs related to the Governor General, but we did not get anything. I also now have more information about WE Charity. These briefing documents were prepared by public servants. Actually, the government is responsible for public servants, and it could ask them not to prepare the documents we are supposed to receive in committee and in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665292">The Liberals have also failed to give us the invoices related to the cost of contractors at the CBSA. It is important that we have the correct information to determine whether problems stem from processes or something else. It is really important that we get the documents. Another example that I gave earlier had to do with foreign interference. According to one article, the Liberals have decided not to give us over 1,000 documents, which is really a lot. Finally, there is the carbon tax. The Liberal government has decided not to give us its analysis of the economic impact of the carbon tax and it will not tell us why it decided to keep those documents from us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665293">In closing, we have seen how, on many occasions, the government has been unwilling to share information with the House, the Conservatives and the Conservative Party. I think that it is really important for the House to get the documents that it has already requested and for Canadians to have access to those documents so that we can review them and identify any problems in order to improve systems and processes. Unfortunately, I think that there is more to the story and that the governing party does not have good intentions.</ParaText>

It is not only the lack of foreign investment in Canada but also the fleeing of dollars out of Canada. Another example I would cite is the brain drain. I believe Canadians and Quebeckers want to stay in Canada and in their home province of Quebec and work, but it is getting more difficult because of a government that does not support business or good jobs and that, in fact, works with individuals who are defying conflict of interest laws to help them leave the country. </ParaText>

For one thing, it has been proven that the people who administer this fund acted to ensure that money from this fund would be funnelled to their own companies. That was clear. Administrators of the $1-billion green fund funnelled money into the coffers of their own companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665325">The second thing that is very troubling has to do with the whole process of awarding grants to companies that apply, because a bunch of companies received money when they were not eligible. This means there is a flaw in the process in terms of the interpretation of who should or should not get funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665326">What were the results at the end of the day? A total of $59 million was awarded to projects that never should have received money. There is also $390 million that was paid in some 180 cases where there was a real or potential conflict of interest. All in, we are getting to close to $500 million or half a billion dollars.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665327">Knowing that, how can anyone think that parliamentarians would not ask to see these documents or ask for accountability, especially when we consider what the Auditor General discovered? The Auditor General is the watchdog. She is appointed by the House to ensure that the work that is done here is done with the greatest integrity because we are managing taxpayer money. The House demanded that the government hand over its documents to the RCMP, our police force that conducts investigations. I believe that the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner would agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665328">What did the government do? It did exactly what my colleague described earlier. It said that this was out of the question, that the government was not going to hand these documents over to the House. In its wisdom, the House of Commons, with all its members, decided to lodge a protest. That is what I will call it. The House said that that was not how things would go, that the House needs these documents and the RCMP needs to see these documents. The Auditor General has already taken a critical look at the situation, and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has raised ethical concerns. Now we want to know whether any criminal acts were committed. It is as simple as that, and to do that, the RCMP needs to have these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665329">The House was dissatisfied with the government's decision not to provide those documents and so it raised a question of privilege. It did not act on a whim. We do not do this every day or every week. We do it when the rights of members of Parliament are violated. In his great wisdom, the Speaker of the House of Commons agreed with the Conservatives and with those who are rising in the House to say that things cannot work like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665330">Unfortunately, the end result is that we are unable to work. We are unable to study legislation. We are not able to move bills forward. We are unable to move motions because the government is paralyzed, given that the question of privilege that we raised is a priority. It is a good thing that is the case, because we would not have the opportunity to rise as we are doing to defend our point of view, which has been largely supported by the Speaker of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665331">The only thing that is missing here today is a little goodwill on the part of the Liberal government. The government needs to agree to forward the documents, to hand them over to the appropriate people so that we can get back to work. One has to wonder whether it suits the Liberal government that Parliament is paralyzed like this. One has to wonder whether it suits the Liberal government that we cannot work on bills that could improve our constituents' quality of life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665332">That is a crass and dangerous denial of democracy. Information is power. When we do not have information and we cannot make sound decisions because we do not have information, then that is a denial of democracy.</ParaText>

They rise in the House and ask what are called planted questions. I know all about it because I came here from another parliament. I know a planted question when I see one. They are softball questions that do not hurt the ministers. It always makes us laugh a bit.</ParaText>

If they have the courage to question their boss's leadership, do any of these 24 Liberal members have the courage to demand that the documents be tabled?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665343">Mr. Speaker, they are coming; the Liberals are coming back. They missed quite a lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665344">I was just saying that members of Parliament, no matter who they are, even government members, are responsible for keeping tabs on the government. We cannot understand why government members lacked the courage to hold their cabinet to account concerning the green fund scandal and ask that the documents requested by the House be sent to the RCMP to allow us to move on from this question of privilege, which has brought our work to a standstill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665345">The most basic precautionary approach would have been to require the board of directors, the administrators of this $1-million green fund, to refrain from authorizing funding for their own businesses. That is elementary. At some point, did it not occur to anyone that something was wrong? After all, we are talking about nearly $400 million involving 180 real or potential conflicts of interest. How is it that no one in the organization wondered if they were off track, considering the large amount of money involved? We are not dealing with one or two cases, an isolated case, or a mistake. It looks like a system to me, and that is not good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665346">When it comes to the Liberals, it is one scandal after another. Whether through the Auditor General of Canada auditing what took place, especially at the highest levels, or through the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, we are discovering one scandal after another. As I said before, will the 24 members who are challenging the leadership of their own <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> show a bit more courage and demand accountability at their cabinet meetings?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665347">Unfortunately, all of this undermines Canadians' confidence in their highest institution. We are talking about people who get up every day and take the bus or their car to go to work. They pay the carbon tax and taxes on groceries, which continue to rise in price. These people get up and go to work. Then, they find out on the evening news that there are some shrewd people who lined their pockets with nearly $500 million or who mismanaged that money, money that is entrusted to members of Parliament who are the trustees of that money. What do the Canadians who are watching at home think of us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665348">We Conservatives do not accept that. Transparency is a cornerstone of our democracy. Otherwise, this is all a sham or wishful thinking. I refuse to sit in a Parliament where the rights of Canadians and Quebeckers who entrust us with their money are flouted, where no one looks too closely at what is happening, where people turn a blind eye, where redacted documents are sent to the House with information missing. They are laughing at us. The Liberals take us for fools. They take the members of the House for fools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665349">We will continue our efforts until we receive the documents and they have been sent to the RCMP, period. For us, there can be no compromise on transparency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665351">Our constituents have never been so cynical about public institutions. People are disengaged. They no longer believe in our institutions because there have been too many scandals caused by the Liberals over the past nine years. There is complete disinterest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665352">There is an expression in Quebec that talks about budgeting like a good father. It is an expression from another time and these days we might talk about budgeting like a good mother. It means not spending more than we earn. What have the Liberals done for the past nine years? Money flowed like water. It was smooth sailing. They created programs that already existed in the provinces, like pharmacare. Pharmacare is nice, it is good, and it makes the government look good. However, Canadians are covered. The government is duplicating programs that already exist in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. People are watching us and the government is spending and cannot even balance the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665353">When someone wants to get a bank loan they need to have a good credit history, they have to have paid their debts. They cannot spend more than they earn. They have to show that they are able to stay on track. That is what that means. However, that is not what has been happening these past nine years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665354">I will add another layer to that. I wish I had more time, because I have a lot to say. Housing costs have doubled, and people cannot take it anymore. HungerCount 2024 has been released, and it shows that three million Quebeckers are now turning to food banks. It is unprecedented. People can no longer find a place to live. Housing costs are one expense that cannot be cut back. When people do manage find a place to live, the only expense they can cut back on is groceries. With no money left to buy food, they are turning to food banks, which cannot keep up with the demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665355">I will conclude my speech with this: I urge the government to do the only thing left to do, which is to hand over the documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>

When people say that the carbon tax does not apply, it is not true. It does not take a degree in quantum physics to figure out which butter or other products are going to cost more when a truck leaves Ontario for Quebec to make a delivery to a grocery store. This may not apply to butter, because our butter is domestic, but it does apply to any other product that comes from outside the province. It does not take a genius to figure out that everyone is bound to pay more. In fact, the carrier is paying more for gas, because the carbon tax they pay has increased exponentially.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278493" Type="2">Mr. Mark Strahl (Chilliwack—Hope, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8665382"> Mr. Speaker, what we are talking about here today is something that should be seizing the House of Commons, and it has been for some time. On the bottom of the screen, when we speak, it simply says, “Privilege—Subamendment”. That sounds pretty boring or dry until we get into the reason we are debating this issue today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665383">We are talking about a breach of the privileges of the House of Commons. On the face of it, on a prima facie case, the Speaker has determined that the collective privileges of members of Parliament have been violated, and that is a serious matter. It is so serious that all other business that would normally be before the House is suspended until such time as this matter is dealt with. I think that Canadians need to be reminded of that and of some of the privileges the House of Commons has and its collective members have, and that if we don't protect them, the current government and future governments will continue to roll over them, and continue to ignore the will of elected members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665384">It comes right down to what our role is, as members of Parliament. Our role is to hold the government to account. This is true not just for members of the opposition or of opposition parties. It is supposed to be true for every member of Parliament who is not a member of the government. I think there is a lack of knowledge, or over time, every member who is, in this case, a Liberal, believes that they are a member of the government. However, they are most certainly not. The cabinet is the government of Canada, and the rest of us have an obligation to hold the government to account. That certainly used to be the way it was, when it did not matter what party a member was. What mattered was their position in the House. If a member was not in the cabinet, they held the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665385">Now we have Liberal members of Parliament, who are not members of the government, who nonetheless believe that it is the role of the House of Commons to support the government. In this case, a vote was held in the House where members of Parliament exercised our rights to demand the production of papers, where it is a key privilege of members of Parliament to demand the production of papers. We exercised that right. We held a vote in the House of Commons, and the majority of the members of the House of Commons demanded that papers be produced, that the government provide papers on the Sustainable Development Technology Canada slush fund and that those papers be given to the RCMP and the Auditor General so that they could do with them what they would. It does not compel them to conduct an investigation or take any particular action, but it does compel the government to obey the order to produce the papers, as was demanded by the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665386">Why is this so important? It is because, if the government is allowed to ignore a key privilege of the House of Commons, there is no accountability. There is no ability for members of Parliament to hold the government to account if there is an ability to ignore democratic votes in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665387">We know that the government has no problem doing that. We saw it when the House of Commons voted to list the IRGC as a terrorist entity. It took the government years, and the only reason the Liberals actually did it was that they hoped it would help them save their failing candidate in a Toronto by-election. The narrator would say, “It did not work.” They still lost that by-election, even though they tried at the last minute to finally list the IRGC, as Parliament had demanded many years previously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665388">Now we are seeing it again with the government denying a request. They believe they know better. We have requested that unredacted documents be sent to the RCMP and the Auditor General, and the government has said no.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8665389"> The Liberals have redacted those documents. They have determined, in their infinite wisdom, that they know better than the majority of the members of the House of Commons. Even though it is a core privilege for members of Parliament to be able to demand the production of papers, the Government of Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Prime Minister's Office have said they know better than the elected representatives of this House of Commons who have exercised their rights in a democratic vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665390">That is why we are here today. It is because the government refuses to accept that Parliament is supreme, that Parliament, not the government, has the right, in this case, to demand the production of these documents and demand that they be turned over unredacted, without any edits and without parts blacked out. It all needs to go to the RCMP and the Auditor General for their use as they see fit. This is a complete and total Liberal scandal. It is another example of why the Liberals are not worth the corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665391">There was $400 million in SDTC funds given out under questionable circumstances. There was $58 million for 10 ineligible projects altogether. There were over 180 conflicts of interest where members of the board of directors were able to vote on whether funds should go to companies that they were affiliated with. It is almost unbelievable if we were not talking about the Liberal government and its record. We have 186 cases where the board members held a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665392">The worst part of all this is that the then-minister of industry, Navdeep Bains, was told that this would be the result of him appointing a partisan board chair. SDTC had operated at arm's length from government, without conflicts of interest, right up until the Liberal government took over, and then decided to stack it with Liberals who had conflicts of interest and who took advantage of government money to line the pockets of companies they were engaged with. The minister was told this would happen and he ignored the advice that he received. This is not new for the Liberal government, but it certainly was something that he was warned about and ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665393">The Liberals have wasted 400 million tax dollars at a time when two million Canadians a month are lining up at food banks. They are just frittering away $400 million while two million Canadians are lining up at food banks, many for the first time and a quarter of them children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665394">I heard a question from a Liberal member just prior to my speech. Basically, his question was about how Canadians have never had it so good and he asked why that was not agreed with. It is so outrageous and out of touch, when we have two million Canadians a month at food banks, when people's rents have doubled, mortgage payments have doubled, and the cost of housing has doubled, to have Liberal members asking why others are not praising the government for its amazing work. I can say that no one who lines up at the food bank for the first time is praising the government or thinks that things are going well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665395">People are losing their homes or at risk of homelessness. We do not have to go very far in Ottawa to see that. In my neck of the woods in Chilliwack, over the last number of years, my hometown has had numerous permanent homelessness encampments and they move around from time to time. This is in spite of record investments from the city in housing solutions and trying to help people. We have a very generous community. However, the highway rest areas between Chilliwack and Langley are full of people in mostly dilapidated RVs because that is where they live now. So, the idea that things are great and talking about the IMF at a time when people are living in a broken-down RV or lining up at the food bank is just completely out of touch.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8665396">We know that the government has continued to drive up the cost of living. Whether it is on home heating, groceries or the price of gas, the Liberals continue to jack up the carbon tax. This makes it even harder for Canadians to make ends meet. They have no problem raising the cost for Canadians, but they will not raise the ethical bar on something such as SDTC; there, they can hand out money willy-nilly to their friends, to the tune of $400 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665397">The government cannot manage a budget. It already has a higher deficit by $8 billion than what the Liberals predicted just in the last budget alone. It now spends more on interest payments than it does on health care transfers to the provinces, which is an outrageous scandal in and of itself. The Liberal government gives more money away in interest payments than it spends on the necessary health care funding that we so desperately need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665398">We have seen, in my province, that the B.C. NDP has managed our health care system into the ground. It is at the point where, every weekend now, numerous emergency rooms are closed because of the mismanagement of the B.C. NDP. It could definitely use some of the funding that the government in Ottawa is spending on interest. I am not convinced that the B.C. NDP could actually manage it any better, but we have certainly seen, in our province, how our health care system has been mismanaged and is in need of an injection of funds. It would be nice if the government in Ottawa were not running up the deficit to such an extent that the interest payments were more than the health care payments in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665399">However, it is a priority of the government to not only continue to withhold documents that the House of Commons has demanded but also to continue to support SDTC and its mismanagement. That is a very difficult thing. We have now been speaking about this for many days, many weeks, and the government continues to dig in its heels and hold the House up by refusing to address this issue, refusing to give the documents to the RCMP and to the Auditor General that have been demanded. If the Liberals did that, we would be back to such things as important business from private members and important work that could be done here. However, the Liberals are holding the House under their thumb because they refuse to respect the ruling of the Speaker and the vote in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665400">Once again, we get back to whom the Liberals think they serve. Do they believe they serve their constituents, or do they serve the Prime Minister's Office? We know that many of them had the most inept coup in the history of democracy. I believe it was 24 at the latest count. They meekly sent a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who promptly shredded it, ignored it and told them what he thought of it the very next day. However, even in the Liberal caucus, there are those who no longer wish to take their marching orders from the current Prime Minister and from his PMO. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665401">Certainly, in the Conservative Party, we will not allow the PMO and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to run roughshod over the will of the House of Commons. This was expressed in a vote that demanded the production of these papers. Again, we can dress it up any way we want, but this is a matter that goes to the core of what we do here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8665402"> For too long, for a government that was supposed to be the most transparent government in history, and sunlight was going to be the best disinfectant, all of that boilerplate nonsense, it did not believe any of it. The government has proven that time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665403"> We have this situation here where the House of Commons has acted within its bounds, within its authority, to demand the production of papers. Again, if we look at the documents that outline how we govern ourselves, that is listed as a core privilege. It is not a nice-to-have. If we do not protect this, we do not have the ability to exercise our rights as members of Parliament in the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665404">That is why Conservatives will continue to stand up and fight for that right and for our privilege. It is not because we feel privileged as individuals; it is because we need to stand up and defend our democratic institutions. This is an attack on our democratic institutions. When members do not respect the authority of Parliament, or when members believe the Prime Minister's Office, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the cabinet can override the will of the House of Commons, they are undermining the democratic process. There are no two ways about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665405"> We have seen the Liberals do this before. We saw it with the Winnipeg lab documents issue, where there was another vote in the House of Commons. The Liberal government took the outrageous step of taking the Speaker to court. Their own Speaker, a Liberal Speaker, was taken to court because the House of Commons dared to use its authority to demand the production of papers and to demand information on what had happened at the Winnipeg labs with the breach of security there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665406">We have seen that the government has no problem kicking the slats out from under Parliament, taking it as a bit of advice that it will take or ignore, when in fact it is an order. That is exactly what we, as Conservatives, are standing up against. It is something if the government can take a Speaker to court and can ignore votes of the House of Commons when it comes to privilege. This is not an opposition motion where members pontificate on a policy issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665407">We are aware that the government has some latitude to determine whether or not it will implement that. However, when we are talking about a core right, the production of papers being one of them, we have to stand up for ourselves. We have to encourage members to be aware, again, of their core function, which is to serve their constituents and to hold the government to account, no matter which side of the House they are on. It is not to simply act as mouthpieces for an unelected Prime Minister's Office or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665408">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is supposed to be a servant of the House, not its master. As long as we allow the government to flout the rules, to deny the production of papers, as has been demanded by the House, we will be voluntarily giving up our privileges and voluntarily undermining a democratic institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665409"> Conservatives will not stand for it. Conservatives will continue to stand up for the House of Commons being supreme, for our votes to be respected, and for the government, when we demand the production of papers, no longer treating that as a suggestion.</ParaText>

That was a big issue.

              <ParaText id="8665413">Certainly, any taxpayer in my riding knows what happens, even if they make a mistake on their tax forms. The taxman is very quick to come back and demand that the money be repaid, oftentimes with penalties and interest. The idea that, just because these firms are connected to the Liberal Party, they should not be held accountable when they were ineligible to receive funds is outrageous. They absolutely should pay it back, and I believe that this is one of the reasons that the RCMP and the Auditor General should be given these documents. They can then determine what, if any, next steps should be taken as well.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8665441"> Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity in this Parliament to reflect on the different priorities of the parties. In the Conservative Party, our priorities are clear. We want to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. The Conservatives will axe the carbon tax everywhere for good. The carbon tax is a failed NDP-Liberal policy that has driven up the cost of everything. It has failed to achieve the alleged environmental objectives that are behind it. It has made gas more expensive and emissions have continued to go up under the government. Many Canadians are suffering as the price of basic things Canadians buy goes up as a result of the carbon tax. That is why the Conservatives, rather than tinkering around the edges, would axe the tax everywhere for everyone and for good. We want a carbon tax election now so we can deliver the removal of the carbon tax for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665442">The Conservatives will axe the tax and build the homes. We announced a critical new policy this week that would make a significant difference by making homes available for Canadians. The Liberals' own advisers have praised the Conservative plan for building homes. In the last nine years, the Liberals have failed to build homes, and rent has doubled under the Liberals. As we have heard many times, costs are up, crime is up and rent is up, and that is why time is up for the government. Canadians want a new government that will deliver on a real plan to build homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665443">The Conservatives will require municipalities to meet critical targets for the construction of new homes. Municipalities that meet those targets will be rewarded; municipalities that do not meet those targets will lose federal funding. This is the kind of real leadership for results that the Conservatives believe in. The Liberals signal that they care without actually doing the hard work of achieving results, and we can measure the outcomes of their policies in the results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665444">The Liberals think it is all about how much money is spent. They profess that we should look at how much money they have spent on this and that. The real test of a housing policy is not how much money the government has spent; it is how much money Canadians have to spend every month when they pay their rent. A housing policy is working if Canadians are not being forced to pay more and more every month for rent, yet the Liberals want to trumpet their own spending rather than look at the realities of the costs for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665445">Costs are up, crime is up and, for the government, time is up. Canadians want a government that is going to build the homes. Therefore, the Conservatives' priorities are to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665446">How would we fix the budget? It is very simple. We would bring in a dollar-for-dollar rule requiring that when there is a new dollar of government spending, that dollar is identified as coming from somewhere. We cannot continually increase spending without ever reviewing and looking at where those dollars are going to come from. The Liberals have been living in an economic fantasy world for the last nine years, where they can spend and spend without considering where the money is going to come from. Canadians know that is not the reality. That is not the reality that small businesses face in this country, nor the reality that families face in this country. Eventually, that reality catches up with government as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665447">In nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, the national debt has more than doubled. Debt servicing costs have soared. Canadians are paying more because of the carbon tax, but also because of the inflation tax. The increase in government spending is driving up the costs that Canadians face by reducing the value of the dollar in their pocket. If we have more dollars chasing the same number of goods, that is not going to make anyone richer. It simply means that everything is going to cost more in dollar terms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665448">We need a government that is going to replace this incontinent fiscal policy with a focused, disciplined fiscal policy that includes a dollar-for-dollar rule. If we are going to propose a new spending program, we have to be able to explain where the money is coming from. The Liberals have run massive deficits in every single year they have been in power. In reality, this is not what Canadians have traditionally associated with the Liberal Party. It is more of a radical NDP fiscal policy. This is an NDP-Liberal government we see. As we can identify in today's discussion on the corruption motion, effectively, with this reconstituted coalition between the NDP and the Liberals, we have the worst of both worlds.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8665449"> We have NDP fiscal and economic policy and we have Liberal ethics. That is what we have with the NDP-Liberal government, the radical far-left NDP approach to the economy applied to government, along with the Liberals' disregard for our institutions, for the rule of law and for proper accountability in government. This, again, is why Canadians are looking at the situation and they are saying that time is up for the NDP-Liberal government. Time is up for the Liberal government. We need a new government with new priorities, priorities that involve axing the tax, building the homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665450">On the issue of crime, it is very clear in the last nine years that, under the NDP-Liberals, violent crime has gotten so much worse in Canada. The government should be judged not by their words but by the results. It will be judged by the results of what it has done. Costs are up for Canadians and crime is up dramatically because of policy choices that they made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665451">Liberals would always like to present themselves as victims of circumstance. They would like people to believe that as soon as they got into office, things started going wrong but that it had nothing to do with them. That is the story that they would like to tell, yet we can see, with criminal justice policy in particular, that they made specific decisions around sentencing and enforcement that changed the rates of violent crime in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665452">Conservatives would restore common sense when it comes to criminal justice policy. That includes jail, not bail, for repeat violent offenders. That includes support for treatment and recovery for those who are struggling with addictions. Liberals have pursued a failed drug policy, which is paying the pushers of drugs. Their policy of safe supply is leading more money to go back into the pockets of bad corporate actors like Purdue Pharma that make dangerous drugs that are then given away for free, at taxpayers' expense, to those who are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665453">Conservatives would sue those bad corporate actors like Purdue Pharma and McKinsey that are responsible for the opioid crisis. We would put that money into treatment and recovery. This emphasis on treatment and recovery would help address the challenges we face with crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665454">For those who commit violent offences in this country, they are going to face serious consequences under a common-sense Conservative government. Our priorities are to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime, to restore the country that we know and love, to bring it home, to bring home the country that Canadians remember.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8665461">The time will come. The time is soon coming. They cannot put it off forever. As one former British parliamentarian said, “even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.” We will have an election, and when we have an election, Canadians will have an opportunity to be heard on the record of the failing government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665462">I was referring to a quotation saying that even turkeys cannot keep Christmas from coming forever. Canadians will have affordable food, including turkey, once again. These are our priorities on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665463">What are the priorities of the Liberals across the way? They are willing to paralyze Parliament to protect themselves from the proper investigation of their corruption scandals. Conservatives have put forward a motion, a motion that was adopted because all opposition parties voted in favour of it, to order the production of certain documents regarding the government's SDTC scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665464">Let us just break down what this scandal is. For Canadians who are less familiar, what is the green slush fund scandal? This is hard to believe, but we had a group of insiders, appointed by the Liberal government to a panel, and they were responsible for handing out money, taxpayers' money, to various companies. They decided to give those funds to their own companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665465">It is like a group of us were sitting around the table saying, “We will first vote some money for my company, then we will vote some money for your company, and then we will vote some money for your company.” In some cases, the person, while their company was being voted on, would step out of the room, but in other cases, they did not. We have instances of people actually voting in favour of giving money to the company they owned. They said they were in favour of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665466">This is the essence of the SDTC scandal. There was $400 million. We had people sitting around a table, who were appointed by these Liberals, charged with handing this money out, and deciding to give that money to themselves. It is outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665467">In times past, this would have been the major decisive story. Today, there are so many scandals, it is almost like it is a strategy. These Liberals thought, if they were to be the cause of as many scandals as possible, maybe there could be dispersed attention on them. With this alone, this green slush fund scandal, it is incredible what these Liberals and their elite insider friends thought they could get away with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665468">It is part of a culture of corruption that we have seen under the NDP-Liberal government. The members think they can get away with anything. Having tried to buy off the media with subsidies, they think they can do anything and not be held accountable for it. However, Canadians are waking up. Canadians are hearing about these stories, and I know Canadians are demanding accountability and change because cost is up, crime is up, corruption is up and time is up. It is time for an election to throw out these carbon tax, conflict of interest Liberals and replace them with a common-sense Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665469">Let us talk about a few of the other scandals that are going on. I want to share a few comments about the indigenous procurement problem, the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal. This really is one of the biggest scandals we have seen yet from a Liberal government. We have a situation with government contracting and the policy in place that says there is a 5% target, meaning that 5% of government contracts should be going to indigenous companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665470">The problem is that these Liberals have allowed many non-indigenous companies to take advantage of that program by pretending to be indigenous. We have various arrangements that have allowed this to happen. We have some some who are outright pretending to be indigenous. We also have instances of abuse of a joint venture, and then we have instances of shell companies. An example of abuse of a joint venture might be a company with 200 people in it, which is a fully non-indigenous company, and then that company being in a joint venture with a company that has one person, and that company is considered an indigenous company.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8665471">Therefore there is a joint venture in which the vast majority of the work, the benefit and the profit are going to the obviously much larger partner, but it is entering into a so-called joint venture, which allows it to officially be labelled as part of an indigenous joint venture even though virtually all of the work and the benefit are going to the non-indigenous part of the partnership. This is the abuse of joint ventures that we are seeing, which effectively allows non-indigenous companies to take advantage of the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665472">There was an instance reported in The Globe and Mail with a private company called the Canadian Health Care Agency, which was in a so-called joint venture with an individual who was actually one of its employees, so the person was an employee at the larger company. By all indications, it was not a real joint venture. The employee was being taken advantage of by being identified as having a separate company in a joint venture, and that allowed the non-indigenous company to take contracts that were supposed to be part of the 5%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665473">There is also the use of shell companies. An example of a shell company would be having one company that has been identified as indigenous that is getting government contracts then subcontracting the work to non-indigenous companies. There is a rule that is supposed to prevent this; a subcontracting rule requires that one-third of the subcontract be to indigenous companies if it has been received as part of the indigenous procurement set-aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665474">However, we have asked for documents on the verification of the subcontracting rule, and it is pretty clear that nobody is actually enforcing it. There is a bit of the Spider-Man meme going on, with the <Affiliation DbId="300006" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> saying, respectively, “I am not doing this; this is indigenous” and “I am not doing this; this is procurement”. Then nobody seems to be enforcing the subcontracting rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665475">There are various structures: abuse of joint ventures, outright pretending and shell companies. As a result, the AFN appeared before the government operations committee on the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal, and AFN representatives testified that most of the contracts within the indigenous procurement set-aside are actually going to shell companies. Therefore, before Liberals get up and say that it is just Conservatives saying this, I point out that indigenous leaders said it. It is not just the AFN; leaders from first nations, Inuit and Métis communities have repeatedly highlighted how non-indigenous, elite insiders are taking advantage of the program that is supposed to benefit indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665476"> It is a crying shame, but it is typical of the Liberals. They did not care about the results for indigenous peoples; they cared only about being able to look like they were checking a box to say that they cared. They want to say to look at the number, at the target and at the box they are checking, but in reality, when the government operations committee started going into it and started inviting indigenous leaders to speak before the committee, we found that according to the testimony, most of what the Liberals are saying is part of the 5% target is not going to indigenous communities at all. It isn't even going to indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665477"> In fact, when we challenged the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> on the issue the first time, in March, she said that the purpose of the program is just to identify indigeneity. It is not about economic development, effectively. She completely changed her tune six months later. However, when the program is allowing shell companies, elite non-indigenous insiders, abusive joint ventures and outright pretenders to take advantage of the program, clearly the benefits are not going back to indigenous peoples, and the Liberals do not seem to care. They want to trumpet the box-checking exercise rather than answer clear, necessary questions about the impacts of the program on communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665478">I speak to indigenous leaders across the country, and they talk very much about the importance of economic development, of autonomy, of giving back control over resources and over opportunities and of putting in place policies that allow indigenous communities to survive and prosper. One key piece of feedback we have heard is that there are various policies in procurement that actually make it very difficult for new entrants, including indigenous- and minority-owned businesses, to get contracts. The Liberals have so constrained the procurement system as to protect the privileged access of elite insiders.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8665479">We saw this with the arrive scam scandal as well. According to the Auditor General's report, we had an instance where GC Strategies sat down with people inside government to discuss the terms of the contract. According to the procurement ombudsman, there were overly restrictive requirements that said, for instance, one could only bid on a federal government contract if one had done a certain number of federal government contracts before. How does that make any sense? If one has a business that can do the work, maybe a new business or a business based somewhere else in the country, started by someone who does not have the same insider access or history with the federal government but can actually do the work, or maybe it has done work with other levels of government and has been successful in procurement processes across the country, but wants to bid on a project here in Ottawa, the government could say that it is sorry, but because it has not done business with the federal government it is out. It is an entrenched protection of privilege for elite Liberal-connected insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665480">These are huge amounts of money we are talking about. In the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal there are a number of players. Dalian Enterprises received over $100 million in contracts. The Canadian Health Care Agency received over $100 million in contracts. A majority of those who got contracts under this set-aside were shell companies according to the AFN. We are talking about massive amounts of money that the Liberals are finding ways to funnel to their friends and to other well-connected insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8665481">That is the Liberals' priority, getting money to elite insider NDP-Liberal friends. Our priorities are restoring common sense, bringing it home, axing the tax, building the homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime. When the carbon tax election comes, Canadians will be able to decide between our priorities and theirs. </ParaText>
