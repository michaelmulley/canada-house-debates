            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7960948">I am now ready to rule on the questions of privilege raised on October 5 and October 16, 2023, by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> concerning the government's responses to Order Paper questions and the Speaker's decision to recuse himself from this matter. While there were two different matters raised, I intend to address both of them in the ruling.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960949"> As members know, to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, the Speaker recused himself from this affair. The Deputy Speaker is vested with the powers granted to the Speaker when he is not in a position to exercise them. I would therefore like to inform the House that neither the Speaker nor his office have had any involvement in the preparation, discussion, and decision-making for this ruling. The findings are entirely my own, based on my own assessment of the arguments and facts, as well as the precedents that have been brought forward. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960950">I will begin by summarizing the arguments raised chronologically. Then I will address the recusal matter before turning to the first question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960951">In her interventions on October 5 and October 6, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> argued that the government misled the House by withholding information in its responses to Order Paper Questions Nos. 1417 and 1582. Citing a media story, the member asserted that the financial costs for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal travel were in fact greater than what was indicated in the responses. The member emphasized that information appeared to have been hidden on purpose. According to the member, the incomplete nature of the information provided in the responses was misleading and therefore made it impossible for her to discharge her duties in holding the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960952">She indicated that because the now Speaker was one of the members who signed off on the government response to Question No. 1417 in his previous capacity as a parliamentary secretary, this amounted to a conflict of interest. As a result, she suggested that the Speaker recuse himself from this matter, that she be allowed to move a motion based on her question of privilege and that the House be allowed to determine the outcome. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> also intervened to indicate his support for the assertions put forward as well as for the proposed manner of proceeding.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960953">On October 16, 2023, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> raised another question of privilege, this time regarding the way the Speaker communicated his recusal from this matter to the House. The member asserted that, under the usual convention, such a decision should have been formally communicated to the House first, not disclosed by email or through the media. She concluded that these actions were an affront to the dignity and authority of Parliament and that, in the circumstances, the Chair should once again refer the matter to the House for a decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960954">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> agreed that the Speaker should recuse himself from any involvement in this question of privilege. However, he did take issue with how the recusal was made public. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960955">When addressing the first question of privilege, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader argued that the government had no intention to mislead the House in providing the responses to Order Paper Questions Nos. 1417 and 1582. He maintained that the government answered the questions in a straightforward and truthful manner based on its own understanding of the information sought. He argued that this amounted to a dispute as to the facts and, as such, is not a question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960956"> On October 17, comparing the two aforementioned questions to a previous one, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278386" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation> indicated that the government had included different categories of information in response to nearly identical written questions and that the parliamentary secretary had therefore misled the House.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960957">I will first address the matter of the Speaker’s recusal from the question of privilege and the manner in which he made known his intention to recuse himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960958">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> argued that, in a circumstance in which the Speaker was unable to rule on a question of privilege due to a conflict of interest, he should instead let the House come to a decision on the matter. The Chair has some difficulty with the contention that the matter should be treated as if it were a prima facie question of privilege, regardless of its merits, only because of this conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960959">In fact, the House has provided, in its rules and in law, for someone else to act on the Speaker’s behalf when he or she is unable to do so. The Deputy Speaker is elected by the House to fulfill this role and may exercise all powers of the Speaker, including, I would posit, delivering rulings on questions of privilege. In this case, as the Speaker has decided to recuse himself, it falls to me to examine the matter.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960960">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> pointed out, the premature disclosure of information can give rise to prima facie questions of privilege. In this regard, the premature release of a committee report or bill has previously been judged sufficiently serious to take precedence over all House business. However, in other cases, the Chair has ruled that sharing certain information about a bill before it is introduced, without revealing confidential details, does not constitute a prima facie question of privilege. Additionally, the Chair has found that some House practices are not matters of parliamentary privilege but are instead political conventions. Furthermore, decisions must be rendered in the House, as I am doing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960961"> The recusal of a Speaker from a matter and the announcement of that decision to the House are rare, if not unprecedented, events. At this time, no formal process seems to exist. Yes, the Speaker’s recusal was initially disclosed outside the House, and it would certainly have been preferable for all members to have been advised first. If this situation arises again, I believe it would be appropriate for an announcement to be made in the House first, if it is sitting. If a recusal is necessary during a period of adjournment, the Chair should formally and promptly notify the Clerk in writing, who would then share this information with members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960962">No details about the potential findings of the decision on the substance of the matter were shared with the media or with the member herself. What was communicated outside of the House was the process for rendering the decision. Therefore, I am not of the view that announcing a recusal impeded members in carrying out their duties. Nor can I find that this action disregarded or attacked the rights, powers and immunities of the House and its members. Accordingly, I cannot find in this case that a breach of parliamentary privilege occurred. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960963">I will now address the complaint relating to the government's responses to the written questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960964">I have carefully examined the arguments raised by members. I have also been guided by precedents from past Speakers who faced concerns or complaints as to the completeness of responses to Order Paper questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960965">In a ruling on an analogous matter, Speaker Milliken stated on February 8, 2005, on pages 3233 and 3234 of Debates the following: “Any dispute regarding the accuracy or appropriateness of this response is a matter of debate. It is not something upon which the Speaker is permitted to pass judgment.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960966"> Furthermore, to reinforce this principle, <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, at pages 529 and 530 state: “There are no provisions in the rules for the Speaker to review government responses to questions. Nonetheless, on several occasions, Members have raised questions of privilege in the House regarding the accuracy of information contained in responses to written questions; in none of these cases was the matter found to be a prima facie breach of privilege. The Speaker has ruled that it is not the role of the Chair to determine whether or not the contents of documents tabled in the House are accurate, nor to ‘assess the likelihood of an Hon. Member knowing whether the facts contained in a document are correct'.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7960967">On the contention that the government was attempting to mislead the House by withholding information, I would refer to a ruling from February 27, 2020, found at page 1649 of the Debates:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960968">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...in the case before us...we do not have a situation where the same individual has presented two different sets of facts to the House, nor is there any evidence to suggest that there was an attempt to deliberately mislead the House. For these reasons, the Chair cannot find that there is a prima facie question of privilege in this case.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960969">In keeping with this well-established practice, the current complaint does not lead me to believe that I have a basis to depart from past Speakers' decisions. Judging the accuracy of a response is not something that previous Speakers have attempted to do, nor is it something I will do today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960970">Accordingly, I cannot make a finding of a prima facie question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960971">With that said, it is not the first time the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> and others have recently complained to the Chair that the government's responses to Order Paper questions were incomplete or inaccurate, or at the very least unsatisfactory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960972">I believe solutions to better serve members' needs for information should and can be found. For example, it might be valuable for the government to indicate in its responses what is or is not included when tabulating information in order to avoid these sorts of misunderstandings. A standardized method of addressing and answering similar questions would also be useful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960973">That being said, the Chair's powers to address members' grievances in relation to the content of responses to Order Paper questions are limited. I therefore encourage a constructive dialogue between the government and members to find a way to seek and provide useful information through Order Paper questions. If members wish to change this process or to give further powers to the Chair on these matters, I would invite them to bring forward their proposals, perhaps to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960974">I thank members for their attention on this matter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7960979">The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the following. They state that whereas freedom of choice in health care is becoming increasingly curtailed and further threatened by legislation and statutory regulations of the Government of Canada, it is a fundamental right for individuals to choose how to prevent illness or how to address illness or injury in their own bodies. Canadians want the freedom to decide how they will prevent illness or how they will address illness or injury in their own bodies, and Canadians are competent and able to make their own health decisions without state interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7960980">Therefore, the petitioners call upon Parliament to guarantee the right of every Canadian to health freedom by enacting the charter of health freedom drafted by the Natural Health Products Protection Association on September 4, 2008.</ParaText>

Due to an expected 18-month delay to receiving the Canada disability benefit due to regulatory process and a risk to life due to insufficient supports on current disability programs, federally and provincially, Canadians living with disabilities on provincial and federal disability benefits are struggling immensely with benefits significantly below the poverty line.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7960991">The particular approach of these petitioners, physicians, is to cite the health impacts of the climate crisis and to draw the attention of the House to the scientific consensus as represented in the Paris Agreement, that global emissions must be rapidly reduced for it to hold to a less-than-1.5°C global average temperature increase and to make the cuts that are necessary before the year 2030.</ParaText>

The petition that I have today is in regard to the government's decision to unilaterally ban the use of strychnine. We have an outbreak of uncontrolled Richardson's ground squirrels, otherwise known as gophers, that are decimating farmland. They are decimating ranch land and they are causing a lot of stress to farmers and to animals, as well as a lot of damage to machinery used to plant and harvest our crops.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961041">I do not want to presuppose what workers are going to say about how they want to get this done. I have talked to a lot of oil and gas workers, both in my constituency and in my time as natural resources minister. Even through COVID, I still spent a lot of time talking to oil and gas workers in Alberta and Saskatchewan, even if it was by Zoom. They all said the same thing. There was a great nervousness about plans being made and them not being at the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961042">I made it very clear that, with this legislation, the whole point of the bill is to make sure that they are at the table, to make sure that they can lead the table, and that we are working with them to make sure that the training opportunities are there for them to avail themselves of all sorts of things. There is carbon capture sequestration, for instance, within the oil and gas industry, even on pipelines themselves. It is so important that we know where and when to tighten the nuts and bolts on a pipeline to make sure the methane does not leak. These are all very important things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961043">These are the only people who know how to do this work.

              <ParaText id="7961045">When we look at this bill, we have a stable jobs partnership council, a sustainable jobs secretariat and a sustainable jobs action plan. We lost a couple of years because of COVID. The government did nothing with that. We see in the bill that all the government would do is create another process where it could reward more of their friends with positions on councils and secretariats with fancy titles. It is not going to be the people working in Coronach, Rockglen or Kindersley, Saskatchewan, in Alberta or in the places that actually matter, those who are actually going to be impacted and affected by this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961047">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the other side, I am looking at the kings of red tape when it comes to energy production. One of the first things I was so happy to do was with respect to exploratory well environmental assessments on our offshore, off Newfoundland. The assessments were at 300 days per exploratory well until the Conservatives got in power and somehow magically found a way to triple that time to 900 days to make an exploratory well, which is a simple drill that goes into the sea bed to see if there is oil there. They put it in the same category as Hibernia and as Hebron, both full platforms. The Conservatives did not even get time to amend it. Maybe they did not care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961048"> We did not want mistakes like that. One of the best parts of the much-maligned Environmental Assessment Agency is that it is able to do regional assessments. We were able to do one for the Newfoundland offshore, and we were able to reduce that time, as a result of looking at the entire basin, from the Conservatives' 900 days to our 90 days, as it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961049"> That is because we paid attention to what people are doing on the ground, and it is one of those few occasions where, in 90 days instead of 900 days, we increased environmental oversight because we were looking at the entire basin and not just one item after another after another, consecutive duplicative red tape that the Conservatives managed to put in the way of our offshore.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961055">However, this is coming specifically from the unions.

The government is afraid of how Albertans and people in the oil and gas industry will react to the just transition, so it prefers to use a wishy-washy term like “sustainable jobs”. If the government cannot even call it what it is, we cannot expect it to take courageous action to lead the energy transition.</ParaText>

It clearly lays out a stable regime to attract investment, and it worked.</ParaText>

The Atlantic accord is held up with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is a document of prosperity where I come from. Now, we want to move the same regime that respects the jurisdictions of the provinces and of the federal government, rightly, and we want to apply it to an industry that is already attracting billions of dollars for offshore wind and hydrogen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961088">The same workers who work proudly in our oil and gas industry in the Newfoundland offshore are moving to these jobs as well. It is an extraordinary opportunity. Why would one be against it?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961089">Mr. Speaker, once is not a habit, but failing to consider existing laws in Quebec has certainly become a habit for the federal government. The paternalistic attitude of the federal level remains unchanged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961090">I would ask my colleague if he has truly taken into consideration Quebec's existing laws. Again, it is as though we do not even exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961091">I will refresh my colleague's memory. In 1995, the National Assembly of Quebec introduced and passed legislation promoting the development of labour training. Then, there was the Commission des partenaires du marché du travail, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. Since 1997, we have also had an agreement with the federal government, the Canada-Quebec Labour Market Agreement in Principle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961092"> Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> makes no mention of that. If the minister wants to have Quebec's co‑operation, did he take into consideration the existing laws in Quebec? If not, are the Liberals going to do what they usually do and meddle in our affairs, criticize what Quebec does, show up with their ideas and claim they can override everything?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961093">I invite the minister to give us an honest answer. Did he take this reality into consideration in his bill or, if not, will he correct this and reach an agreement with Quebec by respecting the existing laws of the National Assembly of Quebec that are already in place and work very well? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961094">Mr. Speaker, I do not find anything particularly paternalistic about this government's or any government's talking directly to workers, and I do not need anybody to tell me that I cannot do that. I also do not find it necessarily duplicative because some other government had spoken to them as well. We need to speak to them. More importantly, we need to listen to them, I think.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961095">I think that the important thing about this is that it also builds on an important policy coming out of NRCan about regional tables, because this country is big. It is different. Our politics and our economies are different. We come together in this place to find commonalities, but at the end of the day, we have to embrace those differences. My province and its use of energy, its development and production of energy, are very different from Quebec's and, in some ways, they are very similar on issues of hydroelectricity. However, on issues of oil and gas, and right now at least on issues of hydrogen and issues of offshore, my province is very different. We have to take into account particular views of each part of the country in order for each part not only to be acknowledged but also to prosper.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961097">The Biden administration has moved on an all-of-government approach and is looking to make really progressive changes on clean energy. I think that it is really important that our government keep pace with one of our largest partners in terms of the economy, etc. This legislation is essential for moving beyond the promises of just investments and tax credits, and I would like to hear about how this legislation could put us on that world stage, as we need to move forward with it. We need to do that very quickly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961098">Mr. Speaker, it is a huge competitive advantage to make sure not only that workers are at the table but also that they are helping us lead these decisions. That in itself is a competitive advantage. It is a competitive advantage when we put in place the mechanisms to make sure that they do have that voice, that it is heeded and that they lead. We do not have all the answers in this place. The heads of the companies do not have all the answers, by any means. I would argue, and they have told me this, that not all the heads of the union leadership have the skills necessary to do what we are talking about. We are talking about the workers on the ground. It is a competitive advantage as we look at some of the phenomenal things that are happening in the United States and particularly with this president and the Inflation Reduction Act, but I think this, at the heart of it, is our competitive advantage in this country: putting workers at the centre.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7961110">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961111">I am never surprised when I see the Conservative tactics, whether it is on Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> or Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>. However, Canadians are telling us, as parliamentarians, what issues are important to them, one being jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961112">Jobs are so critically important. Canadians from coast to coast to coast want to know what the Canadian and provincial governments are putting into place so that we have good middle-class jobs well into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961113">Whether it was Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> or now Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, the Government of Canada, in co-operation, in good part, with other parties, although not the Conservative Party, has been able to get important legislation through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961114">As someone said to me, the word that comes to mind when we think of the Conservative Party nowadays, especially if one reflects on its behaviour and the types of things it does to prevent legislation like this from passing, is “reckless”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961115">The Conservative Party of Canada does not know where it is going. Canadians would be taking a chance, very much a risk, with the Conservative Party today, because it is so reckless in the policies and decisions it makes. We seem to see that more often. The longer the Conservative leader, with the Conservative caucus, focuses on making these policy decisions, people should be concerned. They should be concerned about those middle-class jobs and where the Conservative Party wants to take the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961116">Another issue is the environment. This legislation deals specifically with the environment and the need for us to be in a position to build a healthy, strong, net-zero economy, something with which most parties in the chamber are in sync. They understand that this is also a priority of Canadians. Canadians are concerned about the global environment and what is taking place in Canada today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961117">The number of forest fires, storms and floods have a direct correlation to our environment. Canadians are aware of that. The government brought forward legislation a few years back on targets to get us to net zero. I believe Canadians can get behind this type of legislation and support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961118">Today, Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> not only talks about that net-zero economy of the future; it also talks about the issue of jobs and transition, ensuring that we have strong healthy middle-class jobs well into the future. Clean energy is being looked at in a very serious way around the world today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961119">Where is the Conservative Party? I made reference to the word “reckless” and we should maybe emphasize that fact. At the end of the day, we saw where the Conservative Party was when it voted against the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961125">Mr. Speaker, we cannot make this stuff up. When I say that they are reckless, I am serious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961126">Let us take a look at Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>. The two bills, Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> and Bill C-49, are fairly close with respect to the environment and jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961127"> Many of my Atlantic colleagues in the Liberal caucus talked about Bill C-49 and how important it was for Atlantic Canada. A Progressive Conservative premier and Liberal premiers, from Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia, talked about the importance of this legislation. We heard very clearly from Liberal members from Atlantic Canada. They stepped up and ensured that legislation would pass, because it was all about the future, energy transition and so forth. It was all about coastal waters and future billions of dollars of investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961128"> Provinces were waiting to bring in mirror legislation, but needed Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> to pass. What did the Conservatives do? They were prepared to indefinitely filibuster that bill as well. They were prepared to say no to Atlantic Canada. I do not know what they have against Atlantic Canada. It did not matter whether the premier was a Progressive Conservative. After all, those members are the right of the right in the Conservative Party. If we had not brought in time allocation for Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>, it would not have gone to committee. We had to bring in time allocation because the Conservatives made it very clear that they would debate it and debate it and never let it pass at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961129">Fast forward to today, and again we are talking about jobs and the environment. The title of Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> is the Canadian sustainable jobs act. The bill's focus is a on building net-zero economy and looking at jobs for the middle class well into the future. How are the Conservatives reacting to the legislation? I understand that there has been one day of debate. We were supposed to debate it yesterday. I was supposed to give my speech on this yesterday and I looked forward it. However, in the wisdom of the reckless Conservative Party of 2023, the Conservatives decided they did not want to debate it. Now we know why: This is yet another piece of legislation that the Conservatives do not want to see get out of second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961130"> We recognize that in the last election, Canadians made a decision for a minority government. Fortunately, we have other opposition parties that understand the value of passing legislation. That is the only reason we were able to generate the support that will ultimately see Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> pass, much to the demise and the disappointment of the Conservative Party of Canada. It is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961131">Thinking Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> and what it would do, I would be interested to know what is in the bill that is so offensive that the Conservative Party members do not want to see it pass.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961133">
                <Affiliation DbId="300691" Type="18">Kevin Lamoureux:</Affiliation> The member says “Wait for my speech”, Mr. Speaker. I look forward to hearing what the member has to say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961134">Let me highlight a few aspects of the bill and maybe the member can provide her thoughts on what I believe are three very positive things. Let us remember that through the legislation, we would establish a sustainable jobs partnership council. It is a committee of sorts. It could be up to, I believe, 15 members. The individuals who would be on that council, which would provide advice to the government, are as follows: business community leaders; labour representatives; representatives of regional interests, like the Atlantic community, and the impact of billions of dollars of potential development, which the Conservatives voted against; indigenous communities; and others who could potentially contribute to a healthy, educated and well-thought-out process. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961135">Why would the Conservative Party of Canada not support that? What do they have against having good ideas being brought forward to the government so it can be in a position to develop a report or take action? We will wait until the next Conservative speaker, who might say something positive about the council, but I will not hold my breath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961136">Another thing the legislation would do is put in place a sustainable jobs action plan. I talked about the council and how every five years there would an action plan presented to the government, a five-year forecast with respect to what we could look at in the up and coming years ahead. The first report will come out in 2025, and that as a positive thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961137">The government is saying that it wants to share with Canadians a plan that can build confidence for industries, whether one is an investor or a young person who wants a sense of what direction to go in with respect to a career. What is wrong with having a five-year plan? Again, it as a positive thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961138">Another issue is the sustainable jobs secretariat. The government is bent on having a secretariat, which would make a significant difference. We would have an advisory council that generates ideas, a reporting mechanism and a secretariat to ensure there is some coordination and action taking place. That is also incorporated into the legislation. Again, that is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961139">When I look at the legislation, the three things I just finished highlighting are the real basics of the framework that will make a positive difference. It will have a positive outcome for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961140">Back in the late winter of 2015, we said that this government's focus would be on Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. When we stand and talk about future jobs, those jobs will support Canada's middle class and those who are aspiring to be a part of it. We are looking to build supports.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961141"> Let us take a look at what happened yesterday when we brought forward the legislation for debate, which I believe would have been the second day of debate on it. That is when members opposite, including the member who said that she has something to say after me, would have had her opportunity to speak to this legislation. As she knows, that did not happen. Why did that not happen? Instead of talking about jobs, as I referred to yesterday, what members of the Conservative Party want to do is continue their personal attacks, something I have referenced as character assassinations. They believe that as long as they focus on character assassinations, while staying away from the issues, that is all Canadians will focus on. That is what they push. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961142">All one needs to do is look at what they actually did yesterday. Instead of talking about jobs, they brought forward a motion for a concurrence report. When someone brings in such a motion, what they typically want to see is the House pass a report by having a vote, so that we will, in essence, agree to it. That is usually the desire. However, then they moved an amendment to have the standing committee deal with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961143">Colleagues can see the relevance of this very quickly, because the motion to defer it to a committee could have been done in a standing committee. Members could have raised the amendment and tried to put that on the agenda of a standing committee, but they chose not to do that. Why did they choose not to do that? It was because Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> and those points that I just finished highlighting were not debated. Instead, we talked about the concurrence report amendment. As a result, we never had the debate on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961144">We can fast-forward to today. The government now brings in time allocation and says that there is a limit to the amount of debate on this bill. I am sure we are going to hear comments from the other side during the debate in terms of how the government is trying to limit debate. In reality, those individuals who are following the debate, looking at the Conservative Party of Canada's behaviour on legislation in general, will find that, when the Conservative Party opposes legislation, it has no intention to pass the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961145">It does not take much. I could take a dozen grade 12 students from Sisler or Maples high school in my community, R. B. Russell or Children of the Earth, and I could prevent legislation from passing if they were members of Parliament. We would just have to put them up to speak. We all know there is a limit to the amount of time for speech, so all someone has to do is put up one speaker after another and then maybe move an amendment. They can repeat that and it will never get voted on, unless of course a closure motion or time allocation is brought in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961146">The Conservatives were very clear yesterday. Prior to that I honestly did not know how they were going to be voting on Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>. Now I have come to believe they are going to be voting against it. That is one of the motivating reasons that they did not want the debate to occur yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961147">The government only has so many hours of debate in any given week. We can take a look at the number of times that the Conservatives have tried to kill that time, as much as they can. We can look at the times when opposition members have stood up to move that so and so be heard, and then they cause the bells to ring, to prevent debate on government bills.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961148">We can look at the times they have tried to adjourn the House, again in an attempt to prevent debate. We can look at the times they denied the House sitting until midnight when the government wanted to provide more time for debate—</ParaText>

That would be from 2016 to prepandemic.

              <ParaText id="7961178">Before I get started, let me give another shout-out to another fellow Albertan, another colleague in this House who has done incredible work on this unjust legislation, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278382" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>. She has been an absolute advocate not only for our province but also for our world-class and world-leading energy sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961179">The world needs more clean, responsible low-carbon energy. Not only does the world need Canada's world-class energy, but Canadians need it too. They need it not only to heat their homes, keep the lights on and fuel their vehicles, but for the economic benefit it brings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961180">After eight years of the incompetent Liberal-NDP government, it is just not worth the cost for Canadians or our resource sector. Canada is last among developed countries for GDP per capita growth. Canadians are suffering with the worst GDP per capita growth rate since the Great Depression, or since the 1930s. GDP per person in Canada today is just under what it was halfway through 2018. That means Canada has had five years' worth of economic productivity wiped out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961181">According to the OECD, Canada will remain last among developed countries for GDP per capita growth through 2060. The government has been doing one thing really well, which is chasing investment out of our country. As our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> once said, all of our exes are running away to Texas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961182">The costly Liberal-NDP coalition has not just been chasing investment out of our country, but chasing out jobs, people and talent as well. People do not want to move to this country because they do not see a future here anymore. When my family came here as immigrants, there was a hope in Canada that if one put in hard work, one would be able to see the fruits of that labour. However, after years of the Liberal-NDP <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, all that hope has been wiped away by bad economic policy that has told the world that Canada is not open for business anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961183">This unjust legislation would further hurt Canada's economy and reputation on the world stage, as if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s reputation has not already damaged Canada enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961184">The Coalition of Concerned Manufacturers and Businesses of Canada was formed just a few years ago to advocate against the government's anti-competitive and antiworker policies. Now half of its manufacturer members have already moved or are moving their operations out of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961185">The green industry in Canada will not even make a dent in the kind of economic development and growth needed for recovery. In 2007, the clean-tech sector was 3% of Canada's GDP. Today, even after billions and billions of tax dollars and government subsidies and billions more in private sector investment, it is still only 3%, and 1.6% of employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961186">Despite the anti-energy agenda by the Liberal-NDP government, the unconstitutional “no more pipelines” bill, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, the tanker ban bill, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, cancelling Energy East, cancelling Keystone XL and not building any of the 18 LNG projects proposed when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office, Canada's energy sector still represents 10% of our GDP and, with the related manufacturing that comes with it, contributes over $120 billion to our economy. Canada needs its energy sector to be strong to attract businesses, investments and jobs in order to get our economic growth and productivity back on track. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961187">The Liberal-NDP government loves nothing more than to vilify profit or the success of large Canadian industries. When it comes to Canada's energy sector, it is like a sport for the left to see who can hate it the most. There is a big cost to these failed Liberal-NDP policies, these anti-energy and anti-Canada policies. These attacks will throw at least 170,000 people out of work across the country, many of them in my home province of Alberta and many in my riding of Calgary Forest Lawn. They will displace another 450,000 workers and risk the livelihoods of 2.7 million Canadians in all provinces and sectors, regardless of whether they are working class or middle class.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961188">We know that people would lose jobs with the unjust transition the left is proposing. We already saw it in Ontario under Kathleen Wynne with the green energy program, which killed off nearly 100,000 jobs directly. The 50,000 green jobs those Liberals promised to create never materialized. In Alberta, the Rachel Notley NDP, in 2015, implemented a just transition, and in small mining towns like Hanna, just north of Calgary, workers were promised new green jobs once their coal mining jobs were wiped out. Just as in Ontario, over 1,000 workers left town because the jobs that had been promised were not there. This was in a town of just under 3,000 people, and 1,000 were driven out of work and out of town.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961189">The sheer number of job losses we are talking about on a national scale is devastating, especially at a time when Canadians face a cost of living crisis. Sixty per cent of Canadians are choosing cheaper, less nutritious food because they cannot afford healthy options. Millions of Canadians are visiting food banks as families choose between keeping a roof over their head and keeping food on the table. Nearly a third of mortgage holders are concerned they will not be able to afford their mortgage, as interest rates could increase monthly payments by 40% or higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961190">It is not just the jobs, livelihoods and communities that suffer when the Liberal-NDP government attacks our energy industry. It is also hurting Canadian pensions. The Canadian pension plan and Ontario pension plan invest billions in Canada's oil and gas sector because they know it is a good return on investment. In fact, seven of the largest pension funds in Canada remain invested in Canadian oil and gas. By firing energy workers and attacking our world-class energy sector, the Liberal-NDP coalition is attacking the retirement security of Canadian seniors and workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961191">There is a huge impact of this unjust transition on communities and Canadians. There is nothing fair, equitable or remotely just in this blatant anti-energy attack. The Liberal-NDP government, with its war on Canadian jobs and paycheques, is not worth the cost. Canadian energy companies provide good-paying jobs, even good union jobs, for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961192">As an example, the Keystone XL pipeline project was to employ 1,400 direct and 5,400 indirect jobs in Alberta alone. The province and TC Energy partnered with Natural Law Energy, an indigenous-led and indigenous-run company. Many of the Canadians who worked on the project were indigenous. The economic benefit for Albertans in surrounding rural communities kept people employed and businesses running.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961193">Canadian energy companies are also leaders in the investment and development of clean technology. Seventy-five per cent of private sector investment in clean technology comes from the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961194">Canada's energy sector contributes $48 billion in taxes and royalties to all levels of government. These continuous attacks on our energy sector drive up the cost of gas, groceries and home heating. We do not need to go very far to ask a Canadian about that. We have talked to Canadians all across this country who just last winter were hit with the failed policies of the Liberal-NDP government when we saw the cost of heating homes double and saw gas prices at record levels. All of these things are contributing to the cost of living crisis we see today with the failed carbon tax scam that the Liberal-NDP government continues to introduce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961195">It was not like this before the Liberal-NDP government and it will not be like that after the Liberal-NDP government, because when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> becomes prime minister of this country, we are going to bring it home. Conservatives will bring home energy production to Canada to produce energy here and create jobs to get Canadians good paycheques instead of giving dollars to dictators. We will green-light green projects like tidal water, hydro, hydrogen and LNG. We are going to make sure that we support our seniors by axing the failed carbon tax to bring down the cost of gas, groceries and home heating and bring home lower prices. We are going to bring it home for Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7961208">Madam Speaker, it is always difficult to follow my colleague for Calgary Forest Lawn. He has articulated so very well the concerns with Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, and that is on top of the work of our great colleague, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278382" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961209">I want to talk about the implications of the bill and how dangerous this proposed mandated threat is to the hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs that are entailed in this just transition legislation. I want to be clear to members of the House that this careless Liberal-NDP government and its bill before us would shatter the prosperity, stability and economics of Canada and the provinces, as well as our energy and agriculture sectors. Indeed, rather than being proud of the sustainability, innovation and skill sets we have developed here in Canada, the Liberal-NDP government is proud of the number of jobs it would be eliminating through this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961210">I want to be very clear because these are the stats, right from the government's own memos, that come with the just transition legislation. According to the government's internal briefings, this legislation would kill 170,000 direct jobs, displace 450,000 direct and indirect jobs and cause large-scale disruptions to the manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, energy and construction sectors, impacting 2.7 million jobs. The Liberals and the NDP talk about jobs, but the jobs they are talking about are the jobs they would be eliminating through this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961211">This legislation is also targeted and divisive. There is no question that it would disproportionately harm the economies of and the jobs in primarily B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. There is no doubt that it is no coincidence that the energy sector is a large contributor to the GDP and the economics of these provinces. For Alberta's GDP, it is about 27.3%, and in Newfoundland and Labrador it is 36%. This would affect 187,000 jobs in Alberta and more than 13,000 workers in Newfoundland and Labrador. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961212">The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development stated, “the government is not prepared to provide appropriate support to more than 50 communities and 170,000 workers” who would be impacted by this legislation. The government can talk about this being a just transition to new jobs, but the new jobs are not there. As my colleague said, about 1% of the employment provided in Canada is from renewables. The bill would impact 450,000 direct and indirect jobs, and maybe 2.7 million jobs across the other sectors, but the new jobs do not exist, so to say that this is a transition to future employment is simply being misleading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961213">Where have we seen something like this before? Where have we seen the Liberals plowing ahead with legislation based on ideology and activism without listening to the concerns of other parties, or of the provinces and territories? It was Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, and we have just had the Supreme Court rap the knuckles, or maybe a bit more than rap the knuckles, of the Liberal government for plowing ahead with divisive, vindictive, ideological legislation just for the sake of hammering the provinces that have industries it does not agree with. Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> was an attack on provincial jurisdiction. It was legislation that all provinces and all territories either opposed or demanded massive changes to, but the Liberals ignored every single one of those concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961214">However, the damage has already been done from Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>. It chased billions of dollars of investment out of this country and cost our economy thousands of jobs. Do not get me wrong, as a result of Bill C-69, members can bet that projects were built and jobs were created, just not in Canada. They were built and created in other jurisdictions around the world. Canada lost billions of dollars in investment, and we also lost our best and brightest, who had to go to other jurisdictions to get that employment and to have their research and innovations accepted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961215">Just as the provinces and territories are trying to stop the bleeding as a result of the Supreme Court decision on the no pipelines bill, here the Liberals go again with more ideological, vindictive and divisive legislation, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and it is aimed at only a few provinces. Not only that, but the legislation would increase the likelihood of energy poverty and food insecurity not only here in Canada but also perhaps around the world. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961216">On a global scale, the Liberals would jeopardize Canada's ability to provide clean and sustainable energy and agriculture for customers around the world, certainly in those countries that need it the most. Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> plans to phase out the oil and gas sector, and it would have harsh and real consequences that should not be taken lightly. I cannot be more clear: This unjust transition legislation would leave Canada in economic shambles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961217">Today, I want to highlight something specific that has not been given enough attention. This half-baked legislation from the NDP-Liberal government would not only certainly increase the cost of living for Canadians and ignore our world-class energy and agriculture industries, but it would also cost us almost 300,000 jobs in the agriculture sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961218">Most of the speeches today have been about fossil fuels and energy. However, in the government's own memos, the bill would also target 300,000 jobs in the agriculture sector. There are about 65,000 vacancies in agriculture already, so I am not exactly sure where these 300,000 jobs are going to come from, and one in nine jobs in Canada are directly linked to agriculture and agrifood. The minister's own memo brags about cutting 300,000 jobs from agriculture and the agri-food sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961219">Globally, food security and affordability is one of the top priorities. Therefore, rather than trying to find ways to address that by reducing taxes, reducing red tape and ensuring we have reliable supply chains to get our products to market, the Liberals have found another way to add on additional red tape, additional regulations and additional burdens on one of our most important industries. Food inflation is already up 7% over last year, and the government has made these ideological promises. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> said yesterday in question period that they have done what no other government has done before and called the five grocery CEOs here to Parliament to give them a little what for. He made it sound like they landed a man on Mars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961220">We actually had the five grocery CEOs at the agriculture committee eight months ago, so way to be on top of it. The minister sent a letter to the agriculture committee to study this issue two days after the government tabled its reply to the study that we did eight months ago. It just shows how out of touch the government is with what is actually happening on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961221">What it also ignores is the incredible results we have had here in Canada, without government intervention and without government taxes. Canadian energy could be exported around the world, as should have happened with Japan and Germany, who came to Canada to access our LNG. The Liberals said no, so instead they went and signed an agreement with Qatar for natural gas. Do members think Qatar has the same environmental standards as Canada, or the same human rights or labour standards as Canada? If the government was trying to reduce emissions, it did the exact opposite by turning those countries away and making them go to Qatar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961222">If we were allowed to get our energy to market, we would actually reduce global emissions by 23%. That would be a success. Canada's oil and gas sector is about 0.3% of global emissions, and our record in agriculture is even more impressive. Canada is about 2.6% of global emissions, and agriculture is about 8% of that 2.6%. Compared to emissions globally, the global average for each other country is about 26%. That shows the incredible success that Canadian agriculture has had. However, instead of rewarding that impeccable record for Canadian agriculture, Canadian energy, and the workers, scientists and researchers who work in those industries, the Liberal-NDP government wants to punish them and eliminate these industries, which are so critical to Canada's economy. The revenue from these two industries builds schools, hospitals and roads and pays for the social programs that we rely on, but the Liberals ignore that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961223">In conclusion, Conservatives are the only party that will find common sense solutions to the problems facing Canadians, and we will be proud of our resource sectors and the men and women who make their living in those industries.</ParaText>

It was us, the provincial NDP and the private sector working on an LNG project worth billions of dollars, yet the member just said we had nothing to do with LNG.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961226"> The member talked about hundreds of thousands of jobs. Our government has created far more jobs than Stephen Harper ever did, and we have been in government for eight years compared to nine years. We do not need to be lectured about jobs.</ParaText>

Therefore, they cannot talk out of both sides of their mouths to say that they support these industries when in fact they do everything they can to suppress and kill them, which is exactly what this legislation would do.</ParaText>

This is interesting considering they have completely lost touch with the roots of their party, which are about the working-class folks in Canada, such as pipefitters, welders, carpenters and longshoremen, the people who want to work. Everything the NDP is professing to do would assure that these people would not have jobs, which is very well highlighted in the just transition legislation, where 450,000 indirect and direct jobs, up to 2.5 million jobs, would be lost. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961242">This is the first time this week I have had an opportunity to rise in the House, as I was travelling earlier this week. I want to make a comment before I speak about Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, a bill that is a positive step forward in the future for Canadian workers from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961243">With respect to the events of October 7, when over 1,400 Israeli citizens were killed by a terrorist organization, I wish, obviously, to condemn that to the highest possible degree. I offer my prayers and condolences to the Israeli people. As I have stated over social media channels, I stand with Israel and the Israeli people. Obviously, my prayers are for the Palestinian people as well, that a humanitarian corridor be established and that they have peace in that region of the world as soon as possible. Hamas is a terrorist organization. As someone who has lived, worked and experienced the events of September 11, 2001, I know full well some of the feelings that folks are going through these days. My thoughts and prayers are with that region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961244">With respect to Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, I am a member of the natural resources committee, and we will have an opportunity to bring the bill to committee to study it, to work through it and, potentially, if the members of the opposition have amendments or anything else is proposed, to try to make the bill better. That is what we are brought here to Ottawa to do. That is what our voters send us here to do: strengthen legislation and make legislation that moves our economy forward, moves our country forward and creates a better future for our children and future generations. I think all parties and all members would agree that this is the goal of everyone's being here, independent of which side of the House they sit on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961245">Since day one, in 2015, the government has been laser-focused on Canadians: helping Canadians, strengthening our middle class, and ensuring that those Canadians who are working hard to join the middle class have the opportunity to do so. Earlier today, I was looking over some of the statistics that we like to talk about and that I, as an economist, like to refer to. I believe that 2.3 million Canadians were lifted out of poverty from 2015 to 2021, including over 653,000 children and about 500,000 individuals who identify as being disabled Canadians. We have cut the poverty reduction rate from about 14.5% down to about 7%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961246">I do acknowledge the pressures that all Canadian families are facing right now with global inflation. I heard about global inflation recently, during a trip to Europe for the Council of Europe as the chair of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association. Taxi drivers were commenting about just how much prices have gone up over there, what butter and milk cost, what the average family is seeing in Europe, and what the average family is seeing in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961247">The government understands that. We have reacted. We have put in place measures: the grocery rebate during the summertime, the Canada workers benefit and the indexation of a number of benefits that we have had here in Canada for a number of years and that we are continuing. The Canada workers benefit, which I love, goes out to hard-working Canadians wishing to join the middle class and working hard everyday for themselves and their families. It is something I admire, because those are the same values my parents instilled in their three sons. Those are the same values of hope and hard work, as I would call it today, that brought my parents here to Canada and allowed them to improve their standard of living when they immigrated here. In their simple terms, it is about “just working your butt off”, if I can use that term in the most honourable House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961248">The world is transitioning to a low-carbon economy, but we are still using fossil fuels. We will still be using fossil fuels for many decades to come. We have a duty to support the 800,000 or so Canadians who work in the energy industry. We have a duty to support them today and to support them tomorrow as we continue this path toward a low-carbon economy while ensuring we have the energy sources to fuel our economy today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961249">I think Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> is much like the work our government has done over the last eight years, working with labour, with industry and with Canadians from coast to coast to coast to bring forth legislation that moves our economy forward, that moves Canadians forward and provides a better future for us all. That is exactly what Bill C-50 is about. It is about consultation and about working together. I see the feedback from a number of stakeholders, whether they are the International Union of Operating Engineers, the president of the Business Council of Alberta, or the hon. members who have been elected from the province of Alberta. The President of the Business Council of Alberta has said that the act is a good step forward in helping equip Canadians with the skills for the jobs of our future economy. That is something very profound, and I do not use that word lightly. It is about equipping Canadians with the skill set to succeed today and also to succeed tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961250">As an economist, I am fully aware of what we call, according to an individual from Austria or Germany, Joseph Schumpeter, “creative destruction”: the process of innovation and technological change that leads to the destruction of existing economy structures, such as industries, firms and jobs. That has been happening for decades, if not hundreds of years, but we also know that when that happens, Canadian individuals need to ensure that they have the skill set to go to a new job, to go to a new profession or to move up the value chain in the profession they have chosen or in the sector they are in. It happens naturally, and we must ensure that Canadians have the skills to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961251">I do want to give a shout-out to Canada's Building Trades Unions. I do work with it closely. I work with a number of its member organizations, including LiUNA. As the CBTU says, it “welcomes Bill C-50, aimed at addressing Canada’s transition to a net-zero economy, which brings forth key aspects including the creation of a Sustainable Jobs Partnership Council to provide meaningful consultation during [this period].”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961252">We need energy today. We will need energy tomorrow. However, we also know that the world and the private sector, and I love the private sector, are creating the wealth and investing in renewable energy sources around the world. We have seen it through the United States and the Inflation Reduction Act, and we are seeing it here in Canada with the ITC, the investment tax credit that we announced in our budget, very fiscally prudent and strategic measures to grow our economy and help those Canadians wanting to get good jobs and wanting to join the middle class. That is what we are about: providing good futures, providing an environment that fosters wealth creation through investment and, obviously, creating jobs with investment from the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961253">When I think about Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, I think about what we are doing here in Canada for the electric vehicle sector. I think about the investments we have made, with a Progressive Conservative government in Ontario, for Stellantis. There are thousands and thousands of jobs being created in the Windsor-Essex region with Stellantis at its electric vehicle battery plant. Then, I think about what we have done with Volkswagen. I know that one of the members opposite, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278265" Type="2">Elgin—Middlesex—London</Affiliation>, was there that day when we announced the Volkswagen investment. The most hon. member was so happy, and her mayor, who I believe is a former Conservative Party member of Parliament and sat in the most honourable House, was so happy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961254">That $7-billion investment with Volkswagen positions our electric vehicle sector and the whole supply chain for growth; for wealth creation, and I love wealth creation; and for jobs. It will create good-paying middle-class job with good benefits. We just saw it in the province of Quebec with Northvolt, with that investment where the Province of Quebec and the federal government are working in partnership with labour and business. We saw it in Kingston, where the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>, along with the federal government, announced another strategic investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961255">We need to support Canadians. We need to support Canadian workers. Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> is part of that support. We will be there for Canadians to ensure we invest in their skills. They can get better jobs, higher pay, better benefits, better futures today and better futures for tomorrow. I look forward to questions and comments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961270">For many reasons, the people of Canada are going through challenging times. I think we can all agree on that. Many of them are unprecedented. Canadian workers and jobs, and the global economy, were heavily affected by the global pandemic. On top of that, we experienced unprecedented wildfire levels over the summer. It has been reported that there were 6,118 wildfires that burned 15 million hectares and 200,000 people were placed under evacuation orders. Experts say these were influenced by climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961271">Like the rest of the world, Canada must adjust if we want to give ourselves a fighting chance against climate change. Many Canadians have already had climate change impact their work, including workers in the agricultural, fishing, emergency services and tourism industries. There was the interruption of supply chains. Many elements of mining and mining infrastructure have also been significantly affected by climate change. I could go on, but suffice to say few sectors and few hard-working Canadians will be able to carry on as normal at their jobs or in their lives as long as the planet continues to heat up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961272">That has been, as noted, one of the hottest seasonal temperatures on record with warm ocean temperatures, category 5 hurricanes and many extreme weather events. We have seen them play out in the media over the last year. All of us are rightfully concerned, and should be doubling down and tripling down our efforts on fighting climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961273">With Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, our government is determined to help Canadian workers stay ahead of the curve in today's rapidly changing job market. If parliamentarians are committed to supporting Canadian workers through the transition to a low-carbon economy, we must come together across party lines and work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961274">Certainly, we do not need more signs from Mother Nature that we need to do this right now. I think Mother Nature has given us plenty signs for decades now, and it is time to get on with this. I think this bill makes a significant contribution to our climate action efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961275">The need to move fast does not mean we need to do this piecemeal, or thoughtlessly or carelessly. Canadian workers, their families and their communities, whether in our largest cities or in the farthest reaches of our territories, need substantive and clear legislation that commits Canada's government to action that supports them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961276">This act was written after extensive consultation with the people it is intended to help, which is a primary principle of all good consultation work. It has to include the people who are most impacted. Their words assisted us in defining its purpose to help the government facilitate the creation of sustainable jobs for Canada's workers, while seizing opportunities for economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961277">We want to provide support for workers and their communities in the shift to a low-carbon economy, and ensure transparency, accountability and ongoing engagement with Canadians across every region of the country on issues like training, workers' rights, the job market, economic growth, and, of course, reducing emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961278">This framework and all federal action on sustainable jobs would be guided by the principles enshrined in this legislation. They are principles that would strengthen our collective efforts, ensuring that all of Canada's national policies and programs, and the federal entities that carry out this work, are grounded in the fundamental values that underpin this work. This would be along with international best practices, and would be delivered equitably, fairly and inclusively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961279">This means that this act supports the creation of decent, high-quality work opportunities for Canadians by establishing a framework for effective action. Through this framework, we would be better positioned to address the barriers that have made it difficult for some to join the workforce. This legislation has four guiding principles developed in consultation with Canadians, built on guidelines adopted by the International Labour Organization, and tailored to fit with what Canadians value.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961280">The first principle reflects the need for adequate, informed and ongoing social dialogue between government, workers and industry. Social dialogue is a term used by the International Labour Organization to describe all types of communications that help build understanding of and consensus about issues impacting the workforce. The government believes that this is a must if we want to shift to a low-carbon economy, to succeed for Canada's workers, their families and their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961281">The second guiding principle of this legislation is that the policies and programs that are put in place should support the creation of decent work, meaning good-paying, high-quality jobs, including union jobs. It is work that is productive and delivers a fair income. It is work that gives workers a voice in decisions that affect them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961282">Labour policies and programs influenced by this legislation should consider job security and social protections to reduce and prevent poverty and vulnerability among Canada's workers, as well as promote ongoing social dialogue. We also need the policies and programs associated with sustainable jobs to recognize local and industry-specific needs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961283">During our extensive consultations, Canadians told us openly and directly that they want Canada's government to acknowledge, with real action, that regions dominated by fossil fuel jobs have unique needs and opportunities. They told us that our policies need to reflect the fact that workers in high-emitting industries need pathways to low-carbon industries as the world shifts to different sources of energy. I can assure the members of this House that we hear those concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961284">Closely related to that is the need for our policies and programs to reflect workers' cultural values, strengths and potential while we create an environment where workers, businesses, investors and consumers can create sustainable, inclusive economies and societies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961285">The third guiding principle in this act recognizes that shifting to a low-carbon economy presents an important opportunity to improve the diversity of Canada's workforce and address barriers to the participation of marginalized and under-represented groups in the labour force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961286">Let me use the mining industry as an example. The industry's need to hire more workers is an opportunity to diversify its workforce. Women and people who have been granted permanent resident status in Canada are vastly under-represented in mining, making up only 15% and about 7% of its workforce, respectively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961287">While mining is the second-largest employer of indigenous peoples in Canada, accounting for 12% of the upstream mining workforce, the data shows us that indigenous people overwhelmingly hold entry-level manual jobs. We can and must unlock the potential of Canada's under-represented population groups if we are to have enough workers to fill all of the jobs that expect to be created over the next two decades. It is a significant number of jobs. RBC has reported that by the end of 2030, this could create as many as 400,000 jobs in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961288">Because the need to fight climate change and expand sustainable employment is a global issue, the last guiding principle in the sustainable jobs act is international co-operation. Canada already works routinely and extensively with other countries, and we are proud that international co-operation is widely considered to be one of our strengths. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961289">Canada is playing a leadership role on the international stage to promote an inclusive and people-centred approach, and I highlight, underline and emphasize “people-centred approach”, to the clean energy shift or transition, leading on a range of initiatives to advance sustainable jobs while promoting diversity and inclusion of marginalized groups in the clean energy sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961290">Notably, Canada is leading the Equal by 30 campaign, which encourages voluntary commitments from both public and private sector organizations to work toward equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women and other marginalized groups in the energy sector by 2030. Canada co-leads the clean energy ministerial empowering people initiative with the United States and the European Commission, which brings together like-minded partners to advance people-centred transitions. There is more collaboration I could mention, but I will stop there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961291">In our extensive consultations with Canadians, we were told to bring our people-centred approach to our international work, and we agree wholeheartedly. People-centred legislation makes it easier for our policies to remain coherent at every level of government, but, more importantly, it is critical to ensuring that Canadians have equal access to a variety of social supports or job training and job opportunities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961308">Before I get into the substance of Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, I will state unequivocally how important it is to acknowledge the conflict that is taking place in Israel and Gaza. As Canadians, we stand with Israel and the right for it to defend itself and to look out for the many victims of this conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961309">I would note that when I asked a question a few minutes ago of the member from the Liberal Party who preceded me, he said that I did not understand what the bill was about, and they are clapping about that. However, what they are clapping for is seeing Canadians descending into poverty, because the government is forcing them in that direction. They are going to see that Canada is pushed to the back of the line when it comes to our ability to displace dictator crude and gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961310">It is unbelievable the ignorance from those Liberal members who would suggest this to those of us who actually understand the energy sector, not just traditional oil and gas, although that is a big part of the opportunity that Canada offers, and the full extent of what Canada's energy future can be. Those Liberals are dragging behind and dragging us down. They should truly be ashamed of themselves. I dare that member to come to my constituency, look my constituents in the eye and tell them why they do not deserve well-paying jobs. Those members are accusing my constituents of somehow not caring about the environment. It is disgraceful, shameful and shows that they have lost the moral authority to govern on these issues, especially when we look at the results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961311">Let us look at the facts. When it comes to Canada's energy future, the reality is clear. Canada can be a world leader if not held back by these Liberals, whether it is the so-called just transition, and there is nothing just about it, or when it comes to the no-more-pipelines bill, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, which we just saw thumped down by the Supreme Court and called unconstitutional because of the government's meddling in provincial affairs. The government is holding back Canada's potential to be a world leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961312">Shortly after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected, he said that Canada was back. After eight years, the evidence is so very clear that he has been holding Canada back every step of the way, and the world is less safe because of it. The world has a less clean environment because of it. That is the record of the Prime Minister and the Liberals' coalition partner in the NDP. They should rightfully be ashamed of themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961313">When it comes to what we are debating today, I would encourage us to keep looking at the facts. Let us go to the conversation around net zero. Here is the reality. Canada could flip a switch today and we would reduce global emissions by 1.6%, or we could be world leaders and encourage investment in our energy sector, in our traditional oil and gas, and in clean tech, which I support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961314">The result of Canada reducing emissions by 1.6% would be by throwing our people into poverty, shutting down our factories, making it so nobody can afford to live in the country. The only people who would have any ability to resemble something of prosperity would be those who are connected to a Liberal government where they pick winners and losers. To achieve the reduction in emissions by 1.6% globally, we could flip the switch tomorrow. However, and this is the contrast between what Conservatives are offering and what Liberals are offering, we could empower Canadians, empower Canadian industry and use the natural resources that are so abundant in our country and reduce emissions globally by multiple factors of that 1.6% by getting our clean, green LNG to markets that currently burn coal. </ParaText>

Whether that be new clean tech or traditional forums, we should be a world leader in all forums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961321">The difference is that the Liberal philosophy is to hold people down, hold them and drown out anything they do not agree with. That is what they believe. The Conservatives offer a clear alterative. We want to empower people to do what is best for them. We want to ensure that it is not the government that picks winners and losers, but that industry, innovators and, ultimately, Canadians to do what is best for themselves and for our country. When we are doing what is best for Canada, we are doing what is best for the world, and the entire planet would benefit from Canadian leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961322">Let us look at some of the facts. Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> could lead to as many as 170,000 jobs lost, including many of which would be in my consistency. I dare those Liberals to look my constituents in the eye and tell them why their jobs do not matter. We could see up to close to half a million indirect jobs lost. That is the whole spectrum. I am not sure if the Liberals realize this, but a lot of the clean tech jobs depend on affiliated industries that also do work in our traditional energy sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961323">We also need to look at realistic outcomes to ensure that when we pass public policy in this place it will actually accomplish the objective. Nothing in this bill would benefit Canadians. Nothing in the bill would be just. Nothing in the bill would lower emissions. Nothing in the bill would lead to a prosperous future for Canadians. However, we see the government pushing forward, using manicured talking points that are somehow supposed to take the place of realistic and concrete solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961324">The facts speak for themselves. The only evidence that the Liberals could point to for even having an iota of success with emissions reductions is twofold. One is Alberta's leadership in reducing emissions, including in the energy sector. Two is the government pointing to COVID and the lockdowns associated with it as a reason why emissions went down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961325"> It is truly shameful and a disgrace. The fact that if it were any other part of the country, we would not see Liberal members pursuing this sort of agenda. That leads me to my final point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961326">It should be the job of any prime minister, first and foremost, to ensure that there is national unity in our country, yet the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and those corrupt Liberals are dividing our country. I hope it can be repaired.

The only party in the country that supports clean, green sustainable jobs is the Conservative Party of Canada. We believe in an economy that allows for the prosperity of all industries. Whether that is mining in northern Ontario; or oil and gas in Alberta and across the Prairies; or tidal energy, which the Liberals have ensured is not affordable in the Maritimes; there is one party in our country that truly wants to see prosperity for all, lower emissions and a future that works for Canadians, and it is the Conservative Party.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7961347">Madam Speaker, I am rising today to express my serious concerns about Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>. This bill is called the sustainable jobs act, which is typical of what Liberals do. They pick a name that sounds good. Who does not like sustainable jobs? I like sustainable jobs. I think all Canadians want sustainable jobs. It sounds really good, but the problem is that in this bill there is no plan to create sustainable jobs. This is a plan to get a plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961348">The bill outlines how the Liberals are going to put together a council. Based on past behaviour, I suggest that it would be highly paid Liberal insiders who will get these jobs and advise on what the plan ought to be. As to the timeline of when they are going to come up with what the plan ought to be, it be should by 2025, coincidentally just after the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961349">The Liberals do not have a plan. Nothing says there is no plan like a bill that is introduced to get a plan. That is the first thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961350">The second thing is the Liberals have another role, a secretariat, that is going to do some coordination, with another highly paid Liberal insider when they get the plan. The problem is that is it; that is all. It is a plan to get a plan, with some principles that are motherhood and apple pie and that we would all agree on, such as well-paying jobs, caring about the environment and the need to respect labour, all of these good things. They are all motherhood and apple pie, but the bill does not have a specific action that is going to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961351">On the other hand, it is going to hurt. The analysts of the government have said that Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> would kill 170,000 direct Canadian jobs, would displace 450,000 workers directly and indirectly working in the energy sector and would risk the livelihoods of 2.7 million Canadians across all provinces. The bill would destroy as many as 2.7 million jobs when there is not a single action in it to create any sustainable jobs at all. That is a problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961352">The other thing is that it is going to cost a lot of money. Right now the energy sector provides 10% of Canada's GDP and pays over $20 billion in taxes to all levels of government every year. Last year, $48 billion in royalties and taxes were contributed by the energy sector. This bill purports to get rid of that by eliminating the sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961353">We can look at other places in the world that have come up with a sustainable jobs plan and are starting to implement it, Scotland being one example. If we took the cost per person of its plan and did the equivalent thing here, it would cost $37.2 billion. The Liberals are taking away as much as $48 billion and adding a cost of another $37 billion. If we do the math, they are increasing by greater than $70 billion the loss to the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961354">I do not know why the Liberal government cannot learn the lesson when countless people can, like former Liberal John Manley, who said that when it runs these huge deficits, it is putting a foot on the inflationary gas pedal, which is causing the Bank of Canada to put its foot on the brake with higher interest rates. This raises the cost of mortgages. Canadians are suffering from coast to coast, so definitely not only is the bill not going to create jobs, but it will come with a huge cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961355">It is not like this is the first time there has been an attack on oil and gas and the energy sector. This has been a continual theme from the time I got elected in 2015. Let us start with the tanker ban, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, to keep Canadian oil from getting out there when everybody else's ships are out there full of oil. Then we had Bill <Document DbId="9041849" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which created marine protected areas so we could do no oil and gas development there. Then there was Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, the “no more pipelines” bill, which was just called unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. All of these things were intended to be a war against creating oil and gas projects. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961356">There is evidence. When the Liberals took power, there were 18 LNG projects on the books and there were four pipelines. Zero pipelines have been built and all the LNG projects but one are cancelled. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, our friends in Germany were going to give us $59 billion to replace their Russian oil and coal with our green LNG. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said there was no business case, so Australia took that deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961357">Then Japan came up with a similar deal and again we would not take the deal, so Saudi Arabia took it. Then came France and the Netherlands. There were all these opportunities for Canada to be a leader, supplanting higher-carbon fuels with our green LNG, the most responsibly produced product in the world with the best human rights record, but again the Liberal government refused. Instead, it is focused on its own ideology and things that it wants to do that continue to destroy the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961358">We can talk about the electric vehicle mandates. That was another great idea. Let us give away $31 billion to create 3,000 jobs. For those who can do the math, if we just gave each of those 3,000 people $10 million, they would never have to work again and there would not be any footprint. There is a total misunderstanding of how to create a growing economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961359">Then there is the clean electricity standard, another hugely divisive bill that was introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>, clearly not understanding that where the Liberals want to go with all the electric vehicles, electricity and the grid would require building the equivalent of 19 nuclear facilities, like the one from Bruce Power. They cannot build anything, so I do not know where they get the idea that they are going to be successful in achieving that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961360">At the same time, they are ignoring the fact that only 7% of the public even wants an electric vehicle because the technology is not there. No one wants to be trapped in a snowstorm at -30°C because the batteries do not work. They catch fire. In addition to that, they do not have a very long range. Instead, the government decided to pick a winner and loser with the battery plants that are being built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961361">Now Toyota has come out with a solid-state battery, with a 1,275-kilometre range, that works at -20°C and does not catch fire. That will make our technology obsolete, with $31 billion after the fact. Maybe the Liberal government needs a few more engineers so that it can actually make science-, fact- and data-based decisions, but that is not what is happening today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961362">The Liberals continue to move ahead with the carbon tax and the second carbon tax, putting punishment on the backs of Canadians and achieving nothing. Emissions have gone up under the government. At the 2005 level, we were at 732 megatonnes. We needed to get to 519 and now we are at 819. They are not achieving their targets and keep putting bills like this in place, talking about sustainability, the environment and creating jobs. They are not actually achieving that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961363">Sarnia—Lambton has a huge oil and gas sector, but it knows how to do a transition and is doing a transition. It is creating good-paying, sustainable jobs like the ones at Origin Materials, a net-zero plastics plant in my riding. My riding has one of the largest solar facilities in North America. There is a whole bio-innovation centre that is growing different kinds of bio-facilities that are all either carbon sinks or carbon-neutral. These are the kinds of actual solutions and actions we need. That is not what is in Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>. It is a plan to get a plan with nothing else. For that reason, I will not be supporting Bill C-50.</ParaText>

Within the Canadian sustainable jobs act, the government would create a future where the Canadian workforce can thrive as it meets the world's growing demand for low-carbon energy, resources and solutions.

The current NDP-Liberal government has leveraged the future of Canadians with deficits and inflation that are most certainly not in control. The impact this is having on Canadians is unreal.

George Farkouh was a legendary community leader. Born in Palestine and having spent his early years in Beirut and Lebanon, he and his family moved to Canada in 1959, settling in Elliot Lake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961441">While George and his wife Louise started their careers in Toronto, they eventually returned to Elliot Lake, where George became a pillar of the business community as owner of Algoma Chrysler.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961442"> George was elected mayor of Elliot Lake in 1988 and led the city for a remarkable 17 years. His days as mayor were not easy. The closing of the uranium mines in the early 1990s had a major impact on the local economy, but George saw a path to pivot the city from mining to retirement community. He created an economic model transition that allowed it not only to survive but to thrive. It is a model that other cities going through a major economic shift can look to for guidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961443">I, along with all Elliot Lakers, owe George a debt of gratitude. May he rest in peace.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961677">Mr. Speaker, before, I talked about the consultations that informed us, and part of the consultations helped us determine that we would come up with the interim sustainable jobs plan, which was released in February. It reflects what we heard from Canadians and includes 10 key initiatives within areas of federal responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961678">One of those initiatives, which is also in this legislation, is setting up a sustainable jobs secretariat. Creating a secretariat like this is a proven international best practice that was repeatedly recommended to the government. Canada's secretariat would promote policy and program coherence across all the five-year sustainable job action plans that are mentioned in this act and in work related to issues such as skills development, the labour market, workplace rights, developing our economy and reducing emissions. It would ensure that the opinions of workers, industry, provinces and territories, indigenous and historically under-represented groups and others are considered in all work on sustainable jobs across different policies, programs and departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961679">The secretariat would also help in preparing and tracking the progress on the action plans, coordinating federal-provincial work related to the plans and providing policy and administrative support to the sustainable jobs partnership council, another initiative from the interim plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961680">This legislation commits to establishing the sustainable jobs partnership council, which would provide advice to the government on the best measures to include in the action plans. The partnership council would be made up of sustainable jobs experts and would engage directly with Canadian workers, including those from rural and remote communities. This would ensure that they have a voice in the process. They would also engage with labour groups, indigenous groups, industries, trade associations, employers and different levels of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961681">The council members would draw from their personal experience and expertise and give input to us, so we could engage in a process to formulate advice about the concrete measures government could take to support workers, their communities and the low-carbon economy. The partnership council would publish annual reports that include advice for the government, which would also help inform the five-year plans. The interim sustainable jobs plan that was released earlier this year is very important. It is a model for these five-year plans, and I can assure everyone that we are taking great action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961682">There is a lot to discuss, and I look forward to debate about supporting workers through investments and the union training and innovation program, UTIP, which focuses on sustainable jobs and supports up to 20,000 new apprentices and journeypersons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961702">Mr. Speaker, my colleague's contribution with respect to Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> was really informative and interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961703">First of all, I would be remiss if I did not mention that I am speaking today on the unceded traditional territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961704">Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> has been circulating within this country for the last 18 months or longer. It has been a topic of conversation for industry, experts, unions, workers, provinces, territories, committees, think tanks and task forces. This is not something that the government all of a sudden brought to the House of Commons. A tremendous amount of energy, support and careful thought have been invested into developing Bill C-50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961705">We know that Canadians and the rest of the world are investing toward a low-carbon economy. We are taking our lead from climate experts, from businesses and financial leaders, and from employment and labour specialists. These are people who work in the net-zero economy, who work in the energy sector today and are looking to where they would be working in the energy sector in the future. They want to grow with these opportunities and be a part of launching Canada into being a leader in a net-zero economy. They do not want to be on the sidelines and they do not want to be left behind. They want to be front and centre, and they want to be a part of this movement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961706">They all agree that the global transition to net zero has the potential to help drive Canada's continued prosperity toward well-paying, high-quality jobs for many generations to come. This is not just for this year, next year or the next five years, but future decades in Canada for which this would have an impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961707"> We are also taking our cue from the tens of thousands of Canadians who participated in these public consultations. They made sure their voices were heard. They gave us very critical and needed insight and perspectives into where those skills and trades are today, where they see them going in the future, and most important, how they would be included and play a role. That includes representatives from rural and remote communities, as well as from unions, indigenous groups, industry, provinces and territories. All of the stakeholders have participated in bringing forward the legislation before the House today, and that, in itself, speaks volumes as to where Canadians are today in a net-zero economy and the energy transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961708">One of the most important conclusions drawn from these engagements was that, for an energy powerhouse such as Canada, there will be an overall increase in jobs for Canadians. As we continue to diversify our energy mix to include more clean and non-emitting energy resources, many of the experts and pundits are even predicting that we will have more new jobs than we will have workers to fill them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961709">That is a familiar story for Canadians today. The government's sustainable jobs plan is specifically intended to help address these challenges by working to grow the size of our labour force to include more youth, new Canadians, under-represented groups and others who want to participate in this economy in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961710">We have already made historic investments. This is not new for us as a government. We have been making investments to build a stronger and more inclusive diverse labour force, including, for example, the work that we are doing for a sectoral workforce solutions program. This is nearly $1 billion in investments to help keep economic and low-carbon sectors current and ensure that their workforce is emerging, that it is a workforce that is needed and that we are meeting the demands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961711">We have put $55 million into the community workforce development program. This was to help communities connect with employers, with workers and with future jobseekers to determine where these skilled trades are going to be and how they prepare for them. For someone who is coming out of school today, where are those clean tech, net-zero economy jobs going to be in 24 months, four years or six years?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961712">We are way ahead of the game on what needs to be done for workers in Canada to make this transition. Of course, we have many other programs, some that are supporting indigenous organizations, industry employers and a number of them supporting the Canadian labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961713">I come from an energy producing province, a province that has found its wealth in the oil and gas sector. Now we are seeing new opportunities on the horizon for hydrogen development, wind development, solar power development and tidal power development. We are seeing an opportunity before us today that a decade ago we did not even think was possible. We know it is the future for our economy. As a province, we know we need to move where the trends and new jobs are going to be, those new revenues. If we are to have a sustainable economy in Canada, we need to be prepared to make this transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961714">We are not only an oil and gas producing province; Newfoundland and Labrador is a major generator of clean energy. Did we lose jobs because we went from diesel generation to the largest hydro development projects in the country? Absolutely not. We imported jobs by the thousands to do those developments, to build those projects. Now we are sustaining hundreds of more jobs in those sectors. This is not something new. Just like when we made transitions 30 years ago, we are making transitions today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961715">What I do not understand is why the Conservatives are not supporting the transition to a net-zero economy, knowing it is going to bring sustainable economic development and good jobs for Canadians who want to work in all regions of Canada and for those who want to be able to stay at home and have a well-paying job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961716">In fact, I was amazed when I looked at some of the reports and studies that were done. One was by Clean Energy Canada, a think-tank based out of Simon Fraser University. It talked about the number of new jobs that would be created in the clean energy sector alone, about 3.4% every year over the next decade. We are talking about increasing jobs by 46% in sectors like hydrogen and clean electricity. These are not small numbers. These are hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Canadians who will be graduates of high schools and college programs. Not only that, it is coming at a time when we are seeing a lot of skilled workers in the energy sector retiring and leaving the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961717"> It is a great time to be proactive in Canada, and that is what our government is doing. Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> is the benchmark for those things to happen. I can guarantee, from a province which is now excited about hydrogen and offshore wind, as well as from other regions of Atlantic Canada that are moving forward with projects like this as well, that we are not only seeing the thousands of jobs that come with it, but seeing a sustainable, tremendous future for Atlantic Canada, for Newfoundland and Labrador in sectors like this. It gives us hope and optimism that we have not had for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961718">We are getting a clean environment, a net-zero economy, great jobs and are giving Canadians an opportunity to stay and work at home. I do not see any reason anyone would vote against that in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961723">Through this process, we not only had consultations with all provinces and territories, but we also had consultations with indigenous groups, labour unions and industry, representing thousands of Quebeckers in that process. Their voices were very strong in terms of the input they had into the legislation and how they see Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> rolling out. Most importantly, their voices were strong in how they see themselves in what would happen in the clean economy and in the transition to new energy developments across Canada and to a net-zero economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961724">Quebec has a major role to play in that, as my colleague would agree. We are looking forward to having their support and the support of the people of their province to ensure that they, too, would have the opportunities afforded through a clean economy and clean energy economy into the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961735">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, which, as a part of this government's agenda of the unjust transition, threatens to do irreparable harm to the people in my communities and across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961736">I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278428" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961737">The so-called sustainable jobs act, which is part of the unjust transition, represents a clear and present danger to the livelihoods and prosperity of hard-working people in my community and in communities across this country. No amount of flowery language crafted by high-priced, Ottawa-based consultants can change the fact and mitigate the very real message being sent to people in my region and across the country, which is that their jobs and their livelihoods are simply not a priority for the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961738">The legislation before us is a new iteration of the same failed policies that seek to create a taxpayer-funded secretariat of government-appointed elites in Ottawa to decide for the people of my region and of regions across Canada what is best for them and what policies would be imposed on them to meet the Liberal government's arbitrary targets. This is fundamentally unjust. It would lead to significant losses in incomes, to losses in jobs and to losses in livelihoods in my region and across the country. It is clear that the NDP-Liberal government simply is not worth the cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961739">I have clear evidence that this is the case, because this is exactly what happened in my region just a few short years ago. The NDP-Liberal government has not learned any lessons from the previous failures of the unjust transition. That failure led to taxpayer-financed corporate bailouts that cost my region thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars in annual tax revenue for my local municipalities. The counties of Parkland and Leduc are just two among many across this country that lost a considerable amount of revenue. This is revenue that has not been replaced, leading to higher taxes on people who have lost their jobs. Some people worked for 20 years in the coal-fired power plants, and then the government shut them down. Members of the government did not even listen to the recommendations of its own previous secretariat and its report on the coal transition. It did not listen to it, and the consequences for my region were very real, as I said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961740">The accelerated phase-out of coal mandated by the Liberal government and its NDP allies cost my community dearly. However, it did not even result in a drop in coal consumption around the world. In fact, coal consumption has gone up around the world. The only achievement of the phase-out is that workers in communities in my region and across the country lost out so that the rest of the world could keep burning coal and keep emitting more greenhouse emissions while my area was left out and suffered so much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961741">In the wake of the decision of the Liberals and the NDP to accelerate the phase-out of these plants, I met with union representatives and with workers' representatives. They told me that it did not live up to expectations, because the government promised it was going to have retraining and jobs for these people whose jobs it transitioned out of existence. These were people who were earning high five-figure and low six-figure jobs, many of them unionized jobs. Do members know what kind of jobs this government paid to retrain them for? They were jobs that paid $30,000 or maybe $40,000 a year. They were not unionized jobs. These were jobs that are not sustainable to support families, jobs that did not enable people to pay their mortgages or car payments. Since so many people in our region were affected by it, when they were trying to sell their home so they could move to an area where they could get a better-paying job, they could not even sell it, or had to sell at a loss. That is the consequence, and this is a government that has not learned from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961742">Let us be clear on what the sustainable jobs plan is. In no uncertain terms, it is an attempt by the government to shut down Canada's oil and gas sector. As always in the case of a government with an ideological agenda, the ends justify the means. However, what are the means when it comes to this legislation and the government's agenda?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961743">The unjust transition would help destroy around 170,000 direct jobs and displace 450,000 workers who are currently directly and indirectly employed in our traditional energy sector. In fact, across all sectors of the economy, the unjust transition would risk the livelihoods of 2.7 million Canadians in every province, across many sectors, including energy, manufacturing, construction, transportation and agriculture. For a government that claims to be evidence-based, these are facts that it either completely ignores or, at worst, feel are justified in order to implement its warped anti-energy ideology. The term “sustainable jobs” could simply be replaced with what it really means, which is jobs that do not exist in our oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961744"> This is extremely short-sighted, because our crude oil and natural gas, and the millions of products that are created from these resources, are entirely sustainable and will be for decades to come. They are not only sustainable, but they also create the highest-paying jobs in the country and provide the greatest economic return of any sector in Canada. In fact, our oil and gas sector is so important that it is the bedrock of our country's economy. Twenty-five per cent of our exports are related to the oil and gas sector. Without it, our trade deficits would be massive. Our dollar would collapse if we did not have it. This would increase the cost of importing goods like food, fuel and pretty much everything else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961745">Our inflation rate, which is already at record-high levels, would rise even further as our purchasing power collapses. Imagine the catastrophic increase in fuel, groceries and all imported goods if we did not have oil and gas exports propping up our dollar and supporting our economy. The consequences would be catastrophic. It would impoverish not only western Canadians but also Canadians who rely on the purchasing power of our energy-backed Canadian dollar. Inflation would skyrocket, and then the Bank of Canada, in order to get that inflation under control, would have to raise interest rates even further, interest rates that are currently not sustainable for most families in our country. This would lead to more Canadians losing their homes at a time when Canadians are already losing their homes. It would also lead to many families going bankrupt, small businesses collapsing and ultimately, an unacceptable drop in economic growth in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961746">Ironically, this accelerated phase-out of our oil and gas sector, and its resulting impacts, would undermine our efforts to actually make our country have a stronger, greener economy. The commodities we need in order to support wind power, solar power and other clean energy projects are made out of steel, copper and lithium, and these things are priced in American dollars. It would cost Canadian tech manufacturers far more money to produce the manufactured goods here in Canada, and we would not be able to benefit from that. If we have a stronger Canadian dollar with a strong, sustainable energy sector in this country, then we can support the investments needed to make our country greener.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961747">Any serious attempt to grow the renewable energy sector in this country must be led by private industry. In fact, the oil and gas sector is already leading the charge in innovation, and environmental and social responsibility. It is the single biggest investor in clean energy technology in this country. It accounts for about 75% of total investment in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961748">According to Chief Dale Swampy of the National Coalition of Chiefs, “We are the leaders in environmental protection. If you meet with the Canadians who run the oil and gas sector, you'll see that they are just like you. They are concerned about the environment, about safety, about integrity. They'll do whatever they can to protect our country.” Chief Swampy is right. According to another analysis, conducted by the Bank of Montreal, Canada is already ranked as having the top environmental, social and governance profile among the world's top 10 oil and gas producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961749">Not only would this bill and the government's agenda do irreparable damage to our own economy, but it would also have consequences that would be felt internationally. Russia's illegal invasion on Ukraine last year underscored the dangers of relying on dictatorships to fulfill our world's energy needs. When our allies have come asking for Canadian energy, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal-NDP government have continually turned them away. Just today, I read that the United States is lifting sanctions on the despotic Venezuelan regime, which has repeatedly fixed elections and violently quelled dissent. America and the world are desperate for oil and gas. They are desperate for oil and gas from Canada, and we are the only country turning down the invitation to be part of the global energy solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961750">Let us use Germany as an example. It is one of our closest G7 partners. The chancellor came to Ottawa, pleading for Canadian natural gas in order to cut his country off from dirty Russian energy. Germany is a country that, I read recently, has had to restart its coal-fired power plants just to make up for its shortfall in energy. We could be providing low-cost, clean Canadian natural gas. What did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say to the German chancellor? He told him that there was no business case for liquefied natural gas. Likewise, when the Japanese prime minister came to Canada earlier this year, the Prime Minister dismissed his request to help bring Canadian energy to Japan, and he offered just his signature platitudes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961751">Our allies do not want platitudes. They want Canadian energy. The conclusion is clear: On this side of the House, we believe that as long as the world needs traditional sources of energy, Canada should continue to develop and export its energy sources. Let us let the world's energy market be dominated by a democratic country for a change, one with the highest environmental standards and human rights standards. Let it be Canadian energy for a change.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7961786">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased and proud to take part in this debate since it is an essential debate for the future of Canada and, let us be honest, for the future of the planet. We are talking here about the vision, the perspective we have when it comes to Canada's natural resources given the challenges we are facing with climate change, which is real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961787">First, let us begin by defining what is at stake. Climate change is real. Humans are contributing to it. Humans therefore need to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, reducing pollution. Over the eight years that this government has been here, what is Canada's record? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961788">Using a mathematical and scientific process, the United Nations, or UN, which is not just any old organization, analyzed 63 countries around the world to see which nations were most effective at countering the effects of climate change. After eight years of this Liberal government, Canada ranks 58 out of 63 countries. That is not our statistic. It did not come from overly conservative observers. It did not come from climate deniers. No, it came from people in the UN. They handed out their report card: After eight years of the Liberal government, Canada is ranked 58 out of 63 when it comes to effectively fighting climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961789">Will people be surprised by this disappointing result given that the government had pumped itself up and bragged about their ambitious targets?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7961790">“Canada is back.” That is exactly what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said eight years ago in Paris. People all around the world applauded that Canada was back. However, after eight years, Canada is way back, at number 58 out of 63. That is the result of policies based on ideology, not on pragmatism and practice.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7961791">That is why, sadly, Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C‑50</Document> follows once again in the same Liberal tradition that this government is imposing on Canadians. In other words, the Liberals think that they are the only ones who know what to do, that they will tax everyone and that is going to reduce emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961792">After eight years, that is not what happened. This government has never met its targets. The rare times when there were reductions was, unfortunately, during the pandemic. If the Liberals' game plan is to bring Canada back there and shut down the economy for a few months, that is not exactly the best thing to do. We can all agree. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961793">It is obvious that introducing carbon taxes is not working. That is the reality. Why is that not working? Because we would need all 195 countries in the world to have carbon pricing systems that were equivalent everywhere, with the same requirements everywhere and the same challenges everywhere The problem, however, is that the big polluters, the big emitters, starting with our biggest neighbour, do not subscribe to this system. This is a prime example of how important geography can be. The United States of America is our main neighbour, our main economic partner and our main competitor. Here in Canada, we are always quick and proud to lecture those around us. We tax people. We tax businesses. We tax wealth creators. We tax job creators. As a result, people go elsewhere instead of investing here. We are shooting ourselves in the foot. It is better to go elsewhere. That is the problem with this dogmatic approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961794">Our approach is much more concrete, pragmatic and effective. It will deliver tangible results. On September 2, 2,500 Conservative supporters from across Canada gathered in Quebec City for our national convention. We had not had this type of event in five years. We were all under the same roof. The event took place on the evening of September 2 in Quebec City. I am from Quebec City. I am very proud to say that.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7961795">On September 2, there was a milestone speech by the future prime minister of Canada, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. He is the leader of the official opposition today, but he will be the next prime minister. It was a milestone speech, the Quebec speech. It framed where we want to go with the next Conservative government, and when he talked about climate change, the leader was crystal clear that the real impact of climate change has to be addressed. That is what he said. This is why we recognize it, but we want to address it with pragmatism, not ideology.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7961796">The speech given in Quebec City is a big part of the history of Canadian politics and it will make its mark like many other important speeches in our history. That is why it will be remembered as the vision that the party had when Canadians gave us the honour of putting their trust in us to form the next government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961797">What was said in that speech?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961798">The first pillar is that climate change is having a real impact and that it must be addressed. We need pragmatic measures to deal with climate change. Rather than imposing taxes, we are going to encourage people, through tax incentives, to invest in new technologies, research and development and measures that can be immediately implemented to reduce pollution. That is the objective. It is all well and good to brag about lofty principles and say that we are going to reduce emissions by 2.3% compared to what happened in 1991 because it was different in 1996, and so on. That is all theoretical. The reality is that there is pollution and we want to reduce pollution.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7961799">When we talk about reducing pollution, it is a never-ending story. We hear that we need to reduce, reduce and reduce. If we can reduce by 20% this year, then great and congratulations. What will be done on January 1 to continue to reduce pollution and emissions? Our plan is based on incentives in research and development to help reduce pollution. This is the first pillar.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7961800">The second pillar is to give the green light to green energy. People have projects ready to go right now. They want to invest in green energies and they want to do research and development, but there is too much red tape. We need to act efficiently. I would like to provide a very specific example. Quebec is currently engaged in a lively debate about the future of hydroelectricity. Should we relive the great 1950s, when we gave the green light to so many hydroelectric projects in Quebec, or should we do things differently? This is an ongoing debate. Does everyone know that, through Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C‑69</Document>, the federal government has given itself the right to veto hydroelectric projects in Quebec? This is slowing thing down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961801">We want to do the opposite and speed up the process of giving people greater access to green energy. When I say “green energy”, I am talking about hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, solar energy, wind energy, as well as nuclear energy. These are all avenues that we need to explore further with new technology to make them more efficient and more accessible to Canadians. That is where it can happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961802">The third pillar is that we must be proud to be Canadian, proud of our know-how, our energy and our natural resources. Yes, Canada is rich in intelligence. Yes, Canada is rich when it comes to researchers, natural resources and energy. Yes, as Canadians, we must prioritize these Canadian assets and export this know-how. We have extraordinary know-how in hydroelectricity; we are the best in the world. We should be exporting that know-how.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961803">The same thing can be said of natural resources. There is a lot of talk about the electrification of transport. I, for one, am a supporter and I believe in the future of electric cars to combat the greenhouse effect. However, this requires lithium. We have lithium in Canada. Why is it taking years to get shovels in the ground? We need to speed things up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961804">That is why we should be proud of who we are. That is why we need to green-light green energy. That is why we need tax incentives to accelerate research and development. Concrete, realistic, responsible, pragmatic measures will enable us to fight the harmful impacts of climate change. For the past eight years, the Liberals have opted for their carbon tax and the second tax that, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, will cost over 20 cents a litre, or 16 cents plus tax. We know the Bloc Québécois had two opportunities to say no to the first carbon tax and the second one. Twice, the Bloc Québécois lent its full support and voted with the Liberal government to keep both taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961805">That is not the approach we recommend. We believe that Canadian know-how, smarts and natural resources are the best way to face the challenge of climate change.</ParaText>

We understand Quebec, and that is why we are strongly opposed to the law stemming from Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C‑69</Document>, which gives the federal government veto power over hydroelectric projects. I will not hide the fact that we are in favour of these developments and that we want them to move forward as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961828">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to rise with respect to this legislation and the urgency of moving forward. We have come across the worst climate catastrophe in our nation's history with the hottest summer on record. Normally, September is when fire season is over. Just this past September, in one weekend, more carbon was pumped into the atmosphere from burning Canadian forests than is normally pumped in an entire year of Canada's boreal forest fires. That is one part of the urgency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961829">The other part of the urgency is that just this past month, the International Energy Agency announced that the beginning of the end of the oil and gas industry is now foreseeable on the horizon. The agency is warning governments that they have to make a plan because they are going to be stuck with stranded assets if they continue to invest in an industry that can no longer compete with what is happening internationally with the rise of—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961848">Mr. Speaker, the issue raised was an attempt to intimidate and stop members from speaking. I will not be intimidated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961849">I will continue to speak even if it takes all night. I will speak out about climate change denial, even if I am interrupted relentlessly. These are the facts of this bill. I will continue to speak on behalf of the work that is being done, particularly the work we have done with energy workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961850">I was speaking about the urgency. I spoke about the urgency of the climate crisis, and that certainly triggered the Conservatives. I spoke of the urgency of what the International Energy Agency is reporting, warning governments against continuing to invest in the fossil fuel industry because they are going to be stranded assets. The urgency is at the point that we are now reaching peak oil by 2025-30. We have this falsehood that if we continue to build infrastructure, we could ignore science, the economy and reality, which is something the Conservatives have done for so long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961851">I would like to speak to one other element of urgency in getting this legislation passed, which is the fact that the United States, under the IRA, in a single year, has created what is being called economic shock waves for their investments in clean tech. This is a game-changer of unprecedented proportions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961852">Again, I do not know any jurisdiction on the planet that chases away investment, but I know how upset the Conservatives are whenever we talk about what is happening in the United States. Offshore wind, under Joe Biden, in a single year, is moving to 40 gigawatts of power. The Vineyard Wind project would run 400,000 homes on cheap, clean energy. The Conservatives do not want Canadians to know that because they want to continue to promote coal and oil. There is 146 billion dollars worth of investment in the United States in offshore wind. This is something the Conservatives would shut down in a second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961853"> We are seeing right now, within one year, 86,000 new permanent jobs, and 50,000 in EV. What we have seen is the Conservatives, again and again, ridiculing investments in battery technology and EV technology. We had the member who lives in Stornoway, which I do not believe is in his riding, show up in Timmins—James Bay to ridicule the critical mineral strategy, in a mining town. For God's sake, the guy has had a paper route. However, here is a man who comes into a mining region and makes fun of EV technology, when our communities and our workers are going to be ones building this new technology, and we are investing in it. We will push the government to continue to invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961854">The legislation was very problematic for New Democrats. There was not a lot there. We pushed hard by working with labour and union workers who are on the front lines. One of the key places we went to was Alberta. We hear Conservatives talk about workers in Alberta, but they do not talk to them. They misrepresent them. We met with the electrical workers. We met with the construction workers. We met with the boiler workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961855"> We asked them what they wanted, and they said that they know the world is changing around them. Forty-five thousand jobs have been lost in oil and gas at a time of record profits, and the workers know those jobs are not coming back. Suncor fired 1,500 workers this year. Richie Rich Kruger, its CEO, bragged to his investors about the urgency, at a time of climate crisis, to make as much money as possible. He said he would target workers, that he would make every one of those workers in Suncor prove their worth if they were going to keep their jobs. It is taking record profits, over $200 billion, to big oil. It is putting it into stock buybacks and automation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961856">The workers knew there was no future. They told us they wanted a seat at the table. That is something New Democrats fought for in this legislation. Is it enough? No. We want to make sure that we have labour represented in the regional round tables that are moving forward. The idea of the Liberal government meeting with Danielle Smith without labour is a ridiculous proposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961857">Here is the thing, there is no place on the planet that was more ready for the clean tech revolution than Alberta. In fact, just last Christmas, they were talking about the solar gold rush in Alberta. Just this past July, they were talking about how Alberta was set to become the clean energy capital of the world. Then Danielle Smith stepped up and shut it down. That was $33 billion. Here we go again—</ParaText>

If we were to talk to anybody in the clean tech industry internationally, they will recognize we are from Canada and ask where our project is. If we say Alberta, it is done. Why is that? It is because nobody is going to invest in a jurisdiction with a premier who is out to kill jobs. That is why this legislation is important. We have to have workers at the table, and we have to protect the potential for new investments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961889">Mr. Speaker, I hope that was not a point of order on this really important issue, but I will try to continue, because this is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961890">We actually saw at our committee that the issue of sustainable jobs is a top-of-mind issue for Canadian workers, yet the Conservatives have done everything to slow it down and attack it. This is a big issue, because there are problems with this legislation, and our job is to fix it, not to obstruct something that is badly needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961891">I want to get to the point of what we are up against in terms of Mr. Biden. In the first week of the Biden administration, he signed an executive order creating an inter-agency working group on energy transition. He set up a transition group to make sure that energy-dependent regions were not left behind. Biden came out of the gate in his first week. He also went to COP26 and said that America would create a new clean energy economy based on good-paying union jobs, because he knew that he had to send a signal that he was going to fight for the middle class, unlike what we see with the Conservatives, who are out to shut down job investments in Alberta and to attack investments in the battery plants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961892">This leaves us with, my God, the Liberals, who had never talked about these issues before. They were dragged kicking and screaming by the New Democrats. We said that we have to have some key investments. We need commitments and clarity, such as on prevailing wages. We need to say that if someone is going to get tax credits to do energy investment in Canada, there have to be good-paying union jobs. We also need to make sure that apprenticeships are part of the mix.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961893">However, the promised $85 billion in clean energy tax credits, which sounds great, is not here yet. We are going up against a government that, within its first year, had set up its energy transition, a government in the United States that is now saying that there will be nine million direct jobs from the IRA. We have to compete with the U.S.</ParaText>

However, he met with us, and I met with him personally. He said that LNG was not where Germany was going and that it was moving so far ahead on green energy that either Canada was going to provide hydrogen or Canada was going to be out of the mix. That was the message we got.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961899"> Meanwhile, we get continuous misinformation, but where do we get that from? When the Conservatives go to Europe, whom do they meet with? There is Dan McTeague. Talk about a bonkers climate change denier, who somehow paid for four Conservatives to fly to the U.K. and put them up in big hotels. He is my cousin, by the way, so I am not saying anything out of family. Dan McTeague and his group apparently paid for three bottles of wine that came to $1,800 Canadian. Who drinks booze like that?

              <ParaText id="7961909">Mr. Speaker, I think I am getting so much interference because I am getting to the punchline. Then, I will move on, but I think it would be unfair to intimidate me and have my ability to speak circumscribed, because it is about what our priorities are. Our priority, as New Democrats, has been workers, and particularly people from the natural resources industry, like where I come from. I live in a mining town that is looking for the clean energy future, and nobody in my town would be given a $719 bottle of wine. What was in that wine? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961910">I am coming to the conclusion. At the end of this night with these four Conservatives, paid for apparently by my cousin Dan McTeague over in the U.K., meeting somebody we do not know, they had a bottle of champagne for $1,791 Canadian. That is obviously not sparkling Baby Duck. I do not know who bought that for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961911">I ask that, because what we are talking about is the insecurity of workers at a time of transition. Do we wish there was a transition? No, we do not. We are used to living the way we have lived. I have lived through transitions, and it is not pretty. Cobalt is where we lost every single silver mining job in one summer. When our iron ore mines shut down, there was no future there. We know the word “transition”, and we know it is not pretty. This was something we heard from workers in Alberta and other regions. They asked what is “just” about a transition and how we could make it so they have some place to go. This was the New Democratic plan from the beginning, which we negotiated with the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961912">The Liberals initially said that they were going to put a jobs centre as their solution. We said that a jobs centre sends a message that we are turning out the lights and leaving. Where are we going to put those jobs centres? Are we going to put them in Fort McMurray or Saint John's? We needed something broader and something bigger, so we pushed for the sustainable jobs legislation that would serve as the framework. This is the important thing: We need a framework around how these tax credits would be implemented. We know that if we do not have a plan, it will be just a gong show of friends, pals and lobbyists who are going to be sucking up this money, as unfortunately happens all too often in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961913">We need to compete the way the United States has. They brought an all-of-government approach to make sure they were making a truly transformative revolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961914">I will say another thing they talked to us about when we were in Germany. The Germans were very concerned about the IRA, because of the competitiveness. Over in Europe, 3,000 or 4,000 kilometres away, they were concerned about how they were going to compete against Joe Biden and the massive amount of investment that is moving out of Europe and moving to the United States. We are right on the American border, so when $33 billion gets sucked out of Alberta, it goes stateside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961915">In my region, talking to miners and mining companies, the first thing they said to me was, “Did you see the tax credits Joe Biden put in? They are really interesting to us.” We have to be able to say that we are here too, we will compete and we will make sure that the investment stays here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961916">Again, I am dealing with the Liberal government. We are trying to make this work. We are saying, for example, that there are a lot of things missing in this plan. What is the sustainable jobs secretariat? Is that just going to be some desk in some minister's office, or is it going to have a true mandate? What is the partnership council? Are we actually looking at something credible here?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961917">What we are going to be insisting on, while the Conservatives try to filibuster that committee and that legislation, is checks and balances to make sure that regional representation is there. We want to make sure that labour is there with enough voices representing enough regions of the country, because they are the ones who are going to be dealing with the implementation of that, not us. We want to make sure that indigenous rights are fully respected and implemented, and part of that is in the tax credit incentives. They are going to be different in different areas, and they are certainly going to be different in the opportunities for indigenous people. We need to make sure they are front and centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961918">The other thing we really want to know is that we have a youth voice on the stewardship council, because we want to make sure that those who are being most affected by the climate disaster that is unfolding have their future interests at stake. We need to make sure that the tax credits work, we need to make sure that they are being implemented and we need to have better data collection. What the Liberals are offering us on data collection is insufficient. There would not be a job left in Canada by the time they report back.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961919">There need to be mechanisms that come back to Parliament to tell us if this is working. If it does not work, it is going to affect our environment, number one, but it is going to affect working-class families from one end of the country to the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961920">What we were really surprised by, again, with the all-of-government approach taken by the Biden administration, is that we have seen, in one year, a staggering turnaround in terms of projects getting off the ground, in terms of jobs, in terms of commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961921">That is where we are at as New Democrats. We believe that we have a huge opportunity right now. Is this bill perfect? It is far from perfect. What we can do in a minority Parliament is come in with good plans and good amendments to make it happen, unlike our Conservative colleagues, who want to go back to the 19th century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961922">It is not going to happen. I am sorry. That world is gone. What we need to do is to say that we have an opportunity and if we do not compete, we are going to be at the side of the road because the United States is moving ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961923">I will just conclude on this. Let us consider Texas. Texas, politically, is about as out there and as right wing as the Conservative backbench and yet 890,000 clean-tech jobs are in Texas right now. There is no other jurisdiction in the world right now that has invested as much in clean tech as Texas. Texas came through the most brutal heat wave, killer heat wave, able to turn on all of their air conditioners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961924">Meanwhile, Danielle Smith was going around saying, oh my God, if we have clean power, we are going to have to turn the power off. She was paying for these trucks to drive up and down Ottawa saying, my God, if one invests in Canada, we are going to run out of energy. What kind of premier goes around advertising, in an energy-rich province, that the lights are going to be turned off?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961925">The reality is that if we get these clean energy projects off the ground, it is going to dramatically decrease costs for families. It is going to give the working class and middle class steady jobs and it is going to save our planet. We will go to these hearings and we will push for strong amendments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7961976">Mr. Speaker, I see that I received applause from a Conservative. Apart from you, Mr. Speaker, he is the only one who still claps for me. We will see how long that lasts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961977">The Bloc Québécois's position is clear. It is imperative that we change our energy trajectory so that Canada, which still includes Quebec, for now, contributes to the effort to prevent average temperatures from rising by 1.5°C. That is essential. We are talking about the future of humanity, the health of our people, the safety of our communities and the future of generations to come. We have to make the effort. That means we have to stop ratcheting up our fossil fuel production. That is point number one. The International Energy Agency says we must not start any new oil and gas production projects. By 2030, we need to gradually reduce oil production, which is part of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961978">It is completely wrong to think that some kind of capture technology is going to let us increase oil production while reducing our absolute emissions. I am not talking about emissions per barrel, but absolute emissions. These are basic scientific facts. By reducing our oil production, we will gain access to large sums of public money, which is currently being disproportionately invested in fossil fuels. This money could be directed elsewhere so that Canada can transition to a 21st-century economy, focused on the long term, on the future of coming generations and on renewable energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961979">We stand in solidarity with the workers who will have to participate in this process. When the Trans Mountain project began, we did not just say that the government should not invest money in that project and that there would be cost overruns. We know that the project is costing over $30 billion. What we said was that we should take that money that was in the Canadian public purse and use it for the transition, for good-paying jobs in the high-tech sector that produce technologies that can be exported, namely, energy storage technologies. By so doing, we would not impoverish communities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, who are the primary victims of the lack of transition, who will be among those who will pay the most, and who will be even more disproportionately affected when finally do make the transition when it is too late and it is even more urgent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961980">The government has done enough greenwashing. We need to take action. Obviously, when we talk about greenwashing, I cannot help but think about this bill, which basically contains nothing of what I just talked about. There is nothing about any of that in this bill. The Liberals are saying that they want to train workers in the clean energy sector, but they are investing billions of dollars in dirty energy. Clean energy workers do not need this bill. They need an employment insurance system that works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961981">We learned from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278672" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation> that half of all workers are not covered by employment insurance. When I look at the federal government's investment strategies, and when I look at the Conservatives' plans, I am not sure I would want to apply to set up a wind turbine project. It has been so devalued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961982">What would it take? First, we need commitments and principles. This bill turns the process upside down and says that workers are going to be trained. It does not begin with what needs to come first. There is no commitment and there are no principles and no targets. It proposes solutions to a problem that has not been defined. Kafka himself could not have come up with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961983">Next, we need a collaborative approach. They forget sometimes, but we are in a federation. There are provinces and municipalities. There are ecosystems in the labour market. There are communities, regions, workers, unions, employers, chambers of commerce and investors. There needs to be consultation. The democratic and civic process in the communities needs to be respected, but that is not covered in the bill. The bill provides that committees will submit reports, and it is not quite clear what will be done with those reports. We know that endless reports are issued here, and we know where they end up. They end up in a place where no one reads them. That is what will happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961984">Once we have done all that, then we need measures to achieve the objectives. We need to think of the workers, the communities and the first nations communities. That is not happening at all. The provincial jurisdictions will need to be respected. There will need to be requirements for the planning and production of sectoral reports that cannot solely be the federal government's responsibility.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7961985">Labour law is under provincial jurisdiction. The workforce in Quebec has been under Quebec's jurisdiction since the 1990s. Everyone knows that. There are agreements, there is funding. It has not always been easy, but we have those things today. That is not reflected in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961986">My take on this bill is that I do not doubt the intentions behind it, although given that the title completely eliminates the concept of the just transition, one can doubt the government's intentions. However, the whole thing feels improvised to me. The bill does not define a problem, yet it tries to find solutions. It is funny how the Liberals think a report is the solution to everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961987">Since being elected, I have been bewildered to learn that committees work to submit reports to the government, and we vote on motions, but the government never reads them. Why, then, would it read the reports that are going to be produced under this bill? That is not plausible. That is where things stand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961988">The worst part is that the bill speaks to the government's utter ignorance, whether deliberate or not—if it is deliberate, then that is even worse—of Quebec's regional realities and Quebec's labour market. It is a bit like what happened with the early childhood centres. We are way ahead when it comes to skills training and collaboration on skills training. It seems like the federal government always waits 30, 40, 20 or 15 years. It dilly-dallies before eventually saying that Quebec is right and that it will try to push the other provinces to follow Quebec's example. That is precisely what is going on here. There will need to be asymmetry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961989">In the 1990s, Quebec voiced its demands on workplace skills training. In the 1990s, there were discussions about professional training, which led to federal transfers to Quebec for workplace skills training. This bill is on skills training, but Quebec does that, and it is good at it. If results matter, then the government should be consulting Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961990">On June 22, 1995, the National Assembly passed the Act to Foster the Development of Manpower Training. Since then, Quebec has been in charge of workplace training. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, this reform is based on partnerships. In 1997, Quebec created the Commission des partenaires du marché du travail. This labour market partners commission repatriated active employment measures from the federal government to Quebec, and are working together to find innovative solutions, not just in green energy, but in all sectors, because every region of Quebec is different. Who are these people? The group brings together employers, employees, labourers, the education sector, universities, vocational training schools, community organizations and economic and social ministries that are familiar with Quebec's realities. It is working. Ottawa needs to stop ignoring that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961991">When we have immigration files in our ridings, we wait months for labour market surveys for each immigration file when those labour market studies have already been done in each region and in each sector. They are meant to determine what the needs are, what the needs will be in the future, how to plan and how to do things better. By deliberately ignoring Quebec with this bill, the government is saying that it does not want to do better. If Quebeckers want things to be better, they can vote for the Bloc Québécois, because we always defend Quebec's jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961992">What should we do with this bill? We are thinking about it. It is not easy, but maybe something can be done with it. We are thinking it over. For starters, the government needs to listen to these concerns. It needs to consult Quebec. When we asked officials in committee if they consulted Quebec, they said it did not occur to them to do so. They turned red as ripe tomatoes, much like the tomatoes grown in my riding, which are redder than those grown elsewhere. When money is being allocated to implementing the strategies in the bill, Quebec will have to get its fair share. Negotiating labour agreements has never been easy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7961993">Moreover, the government has to honour the Paris Agreement. It also has to honour the COP26 just transition declaration. The generally accepted term in the international community is “just transition”, which emphasizes the importance of making the energy transition and doing so in a way that serves everyone now, in all provinces and all communities, as well as future generations. As for the bill's title, my mouth dried out by the time I finished saying it. That is because someone is trying to hide something.</ParaText>

Within that council there would be appointments of different forms of stakeholders, everything from leading industrial personnel to labour representatives and other types of stakeholders who could really contribute to the development of that strategy. This would ultimately lead to a report on a five-year basis, the first one appearing in 2025.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962001">Mr. Speaker, one thing we heard at committee recently was that workers in the traditional energy sector have jobs that pay really well. Compare that to the jobs that will be and currently are created by green tech companies, whether in wind, solar or otherwise. On average, they pay about 36% less than what a traditional oil and gas worker earns. If this is a just transition would transfer people from job to job, does the member see anything in the bill that would ensure that the worker who is making money in oil and gas is going to be making the same amount when they are transitioned to a different job?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962002">Mr. Speaker, I think that my colleague has hit on something. He is asking whether we saw anything in the bill that will create jobs. There is nothing there. There is talk about reports by officials, people appointed from the “Liberalist” who will submit reports, and about things that have already been done. There is nothing there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962003">I know that this is difficult for people from Alberta and western Canada. They have a resource-based economy. They have good-paying jobs. I understand them. I sympathize with that. The Bloc Québécois is always asking the Conservatives to show some openness, to think about the long term, to discuss this issue. We are debating. We get along. We are able to disagree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962004">However, when the Liberals come here and say that they want to train people, set up boards and produce reports, they should perhaps put themselves in the shoes of an Albertan who is waiting for the just transition and who is waiting to be convinced. It does not help the environment to have a bill like this one in which the government is unable to define objectives and methods, in which the government is asking people to simply trust it. It is always a big risk to believe a Liberal who tells us to trust them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962008">Mr. Speaker, I agree. The point of my speech was to defend the very idea that the member for Timmins—James Bay raised. The trouble is that the NDP often talks about the importance of regional voices, but only until Quebec's jurisdictions come into play. In this case, regional voices and respecting regional voices means respecting Quebec, the agreements and the labour market partners commission, and integrating asymmetry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962009">If the other provinces decide that the framework presented in the bill suits them, and that reports might help them advance because these institutions bring together community stakeholders, the unions my colleague was talking about, if that does not exist in those provinces, then let them take the first step. However, this must never be done at the expense of recognizing what Quebec has already done.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962021">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to talk about this alleged just transition legislation brought forward by the Liberal government. Before we talk about this legislation, we should talk about the success of the Liberals with just transitions in the past, because they promised a just transition for coal workers. They said they were laser-focused on it and that anyone in the coal industry who was going to be displaced by their policies was going to get a just transition. They kept saying this, repeating it over and over again, making these false promises to coal workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962022">Can we guess what? Those fake and false promises were actually discovered in the commissioner of the environment's independent auditor's report called “Just Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy”. The Auditor General looked at the just transition Liberals gave to coal workers, and let me summarize that it was garbage. They did absolutely nothing for coal workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962023">Let us look at a couple of the excerpts in this report. One reads, “Overall, we found that Natural Resources Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada were not prepared to support a just transition to a low-carbon economy for workers and communities.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962024">This is what Liberals do. They try to beat up on energy-producing provinces with punishing policies, but then they say not to worry, that they are going to be there for them and that they are going to make sure it is a just transition. Those are false promises, much like Liberal promises on housing. They say that they are going to solve housing and that they have a housing accelerator, which is going to accelerate something. However, it accelerates nothing. Liberals come up with other programs where they just line Liberal insiders' pockets with gold, all at the expense of taxpayers, because they actually do not give a darn about the workers' jobs they are going to displace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962025">The Auditor General was really clear about this. Liberals had years to deliver a just transition for coal workers and did absolutely nothing. The Auditor General's report also states that the analysis is there was “No federal implementation plan”. Liberals said they had a plan. No, they misled Canadians. The Auditor General said there was no federal implementation plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962026">The report also said that there was “No formal governance structure”. When one does not have a plan, there is actually not going to be any formal governance structure. They should have just said they have no plan, much the same as they have no plan on housing, the economy or combatting the opioid crisis. This should actually be called the “no plan transition”, because there is zero plan. The terrible thing is that there is also almost zero accountability from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962027">The final thing the Auditor General report stated was that there was “No measuring and monitoring system” put in place. Again, when one does not actually have a plan, when one just says to coal workers that it is too bad, that they are out of a job and that we do not give a damn, of course one does not put in a formal governance structure. One has no system to measure and monitor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962028">Then the Liberals have the audacity to come back to this place and say to Canadians that they have new legislation, because they care about workers and are going to give them a just transition. The only transition they gave to coal workers was to be out in the cold without a job. That is their plan as they once again beat up on Alberta and Saskatchewan and say that they are going to transition their workers out of jobs, but they are going to have some grand transition plan to take care of them. They did not take care of a single darn thing with coal workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962029">Let us look briefly at something the Liberals say about this grand transition plan to take care of workers. They say that they are going to set up a council, to be known as the sustainable jobs partnership council. Its mandate is going to be providing the minister and specified ministers with independent advice through a process of social dialogue. That and $1.50 will buy a double-double at Tim Hortons, which is effectively what workers are going to get with this piece of legislation. The Liberals are going to set up a council. Wow, that is really ambitious.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962030">I do not have a lot of faith in the government, because with anything it touches, it has the opposite of the Midas touch. Do members remember the Midas touch? It turns everything to gold. Everything those guys touch turns into garbage. They say they are going to set this up. I say, “Yeah, right.” They say they are going to do it in a couple of years. I say, “Yeah, right.” I can go back to how they treated coal workers. They treated them as I would not treat my worst enemy. They were indifferent. They set up no program, all the while saying that they were setting up a program and that they were going to take care of the workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962031">That is called “gaslighting”, and the Liberals gaslight Canadians constantly. They actually do it on housing, too. We talk about housing, and the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> pops up, puffs up his chest and says that no one has done more for housing, that they have a housing accelerator and that they have this program and that program. However, housing prices have doubled. Rents have doubled, so when the Liberals say they are going to do something, we should actually believe that what they are going to do is cause harm. The policies they have brought in across this country are harmful, including the revolving door of the justice system. It does not really matter what crime someone commits, they are going to be out, because the Liberals reformed the bail system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962032">People who shot up the street one day are out a couple days later, because the Liberals changed bail. They said they were going to reform it to make things better. Now they want us to believe they are going to have a just transition that is going to make things better for oil and gas workers. No one should believe them, and that is not just because of their absolute failure on other things such as housing, criminal justice, the opioid crisis or the mental health crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962033">I remember when my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278564" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation> had a bill to implement a three-digit suicide prevention number. The Liberals said they were going to help. It took two years to come up with a three-digit number. I know it is hard; it is three digits. They could not do it in two years, but now somehow they are going to plan a just transition with this unbelievable plan, the sustainable jobs partnership council. It is going to have some meetings, and it will be filled with Liberal list donors, just as they stack all the courts in this country with Liberal list donors. We can bet there is not going to be one person on this council who gives two craps about the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962034">It is going to be packed full with their radical left-wing environmentalists. They will probably get the radical environment <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to put a bunch of his cronies on it, who will say they can heat their homes with hot air, like the hot air that comes from the government. They will not need oil and gas. We certainly will not have the electricity, because they do not have a plan to expand electricity generation or electricity distribution as they wipe out the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962035">There will be no just transition for a single worker in this country under the current government. When the common-sense Conservative Party has a government, oil and gas workers will not have to be worried about being left out in the cold by a tyrannical, uncaring government. I can assure everyone of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962036">Let us go back and look at some of the results from the Auditor General on the “Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities”, because it is a page-turner of absolute incompetence. The government is incompetent in almost everything, but its members really took it to a new level. They worked hard to be extra incompetent for coal workers, and I should give them credit, because that level of incompetence is hard to get to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962037">Let us look at a couple of things. The Auditor General went through the federal commitments and programs the Liberals said they were going to do. There are 10 of them. Does anyone want to guess how many they actually came through on? It was four out of 10, and they are not even the ones that would actually do anything for workers; they are the easy ones such as having an interdepartmental meeting to talk about something.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962038">As I just said, the Liberals then have the audacity to tell Canadians they are going to plan this transition for oil and gas workers in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where they basically have no seats. They do not care about the people there. They say they are going to plan the transition for them out of oil and gas, even though they left coal workers out in the cold, but they say not to worry because they are going to take care of it this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962039">The finding under recommendation one was, “Natural Resources Canada had not led on the reporting on just-transition activities for coal workers and communities.” The Liberals did not report on the just transition activities for a single community. That is the first thing they did not do. Oil and gas workers in Alberta and Saskatchewan should get ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962040">Ronald Reagan said the scariest words that anyone can hear are, “I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help.” If Ronald Reagan were alive today, living in Canada, and heard the words of the Liberal government, he would be bloody terrified. When Liberals say they are coming to help, people should run in the other direction. Oil and gas workers know not only that the Liberals do not have their backs, but also that they are going to push them over the cliff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962041">The finding under task force recommendation two said, “Natural Resources Canada had not yet developed the just-transition legislation.” Liberals were supposed to do it in 2019. Now they have done this great thing in 2023, four years later, the sustainable jobs partnership council, which they get two years to set up. They are four years behind, and they are going to set up a council that is going to take two years because that is really hard. Setting up a council is hard work. We know how hard these guys work. It is going to take two years to get that set up. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962042"> We also know that no one on that council is going to care about oil and gas workers. No one on that council is going to care about the effects on the economy for Alberta or the effects on the economy for Saskatchewan. The council is going to be packed with Liberal donors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962043">With judicial appointments, there is really one qualification to be a judge in Canada right now with the Liberal government, and that is whether the person donated to the Liberal Party. The Liberals check the list and, if a person donated, that is great, he or she is in. On something like this, hard-core Liberals, anti-oil, anti-Alberta and anti-Saskatchewan people are what this sustainable jobs partnership council would be stacked with. The Liberals were supposed to get it done four years ago, but it is going to take another two years, so we would be at six years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962044">Recommendation three was, “Establish a targeted, long-term research fund for studying the impact of the coal phase-out and the transition to a low-carbon economy.” The Liberals did not do it. I know everyone was holding their breath thinking maybe they did something, but they did not do it. Will they actually do anything in this legislation? This is the question we have to ask ourselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962045">Human nature is that we look at the past record to determine what the future performance will be. As the Liberals did absolutely nothing for coal workers, we can anticipate that they will do absolutely nothing for oil and gas workers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Why would they? Why do they care? They have absolutely no representation there. Well, they have one MP who seems pretty anti-Alberta from some of the statements he makes, so he might want to try to get a seat in Toronto Centre—Rosedale or something like that in the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962046">Recommendation five of what they were supposed to do was to “Create a pension bridging program for workers who will retire earlier than planned due to the coal phase out.” Did the Liberals do it? No, they did not. Coal workers get phased out, their pension is now going to be less, much like many of the Liberals' pensions are going to be less when they lose in the next election, but has anyone in the Liberal Party on that side apologized to coal workers, saying they promised they would bridge coal workers' pensions when they phased them out and they did not? Did they ever apologize? No, they did not. Why? They do not care because they are energy workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962047">Now when Liberals tell energy workers in Alberta and Saskatchewan that they are going to phase them out, but not to worry because they will be there for them, I say that is a load of hooey. There is no way Liberals are going to be there for anyone. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962048">Imagine the devastation for a worker in the energy sector who is phased out and then their pension is not bridged. That is bad enough, but guess what, when we look at a detailed, publicly available inventory with labour market information pertaining to coal workers such as skill profiles, demographics, locations and current and potential employers, since the Liberals ripped them off on pensions, they say that they are going to put together this database so that they can transition workers into new employment. That is okay, because maybe they'll get to punch in somewhere else. However, did they actually do that? No they did not. They stand here in this chamber, Liberal member after Liberal member, parroting that this is great. They bring in time allocation on debate on this after they literally screwed coal workers, and I tell members that they are going to do it again. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962063">Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what I did to deserve such applause and support from my Conservative colleagues, but I appreciate it. Sometimes it is possible to be transpartisan when one has good ideas. I tip my hat to my dear friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962064">It is a great pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C‑280</Document>, which is extremely important for our farmers, particularly our fruit and vegetable growers. Bill C‑280 seeks to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act to put vendors of perishable products, such as fruits and vegetables, at the top of the list by holding the production value in trust. Perishable goods are a special case when a company goes bankrupt because the supplier cannot simply take back its goods and resell them. This measure is necessary and our farmers deserve it. The Bloc Québécois strongly supports Bill C‑280.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962065">As a representative of Quebec's agri-food capital, I am obviously very concerned about the agricultural industry and its artisans. I often say that they hold the only occupation that we need three times a day. That is why I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation>, who is sponsoring this bill in the House, and my esteemed colleague and friend, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, who is co-sponsoring it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962066">I know how important it is for our two colleagues and all my Bloc Québécois colleagues to pass this bill quickly. The protective measure it will bring in is desperately needed across Quebec. We look forward to seeing it implemented. I share their eagerness to finally see our fruit and vegetable suppliers protected, so they can avoid seeing their crops go to the compost pile without being able to do anything about it. Not everyone in the House is quite as keen, despite the unanimous support this bill has received. We asked for unanimous consent to send Bill C-280 directly to the Senate, but unfortunately, some members would not give their consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962067">This is a long-standing demand. The Liberals promised back in September 2014 to address this issue with the Canadian Produce Marketing Association if they were elected in 2015. They reiterated their commitment in 2016. The NDP and the Conservatives also made similar promises in their election platforms. It was also in their platforms in 2021, so I have to wonder why this has taken so long and why Bill C-280 could not be fast-tracked to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962068">We are now in 2023. The first promise was made in 2014 and we are in 2023. Better sooner than later, but better late than never. I am pleased to see that we are near our goal, especially given that the implementation of our protection will also help remove an irritant in our relationship with our American neighbours. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962069">The sector's request of such a bill has been so strong since 2014 because on October 1 of that year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture revoked preferential access from its legislation for perishable agricultural products from producers here at home. Up until that point, Canadian and Quebec farmers were protected by this legislation in cases where American purchasers declared bankruptcy. Since Canada, for its part, did not have a trust mechanism for cases of buyer bankruptcy that could have protected American farmers, the U.S. decided to remove that security from Canadian suppliers. In short, they did that in response to a gap in our legislation. <Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962070">Although an alternative process has been developed between the two countries, it is extraordinarily cumbersome, especially for smaller companies, which have to undertake the tedious process of filing a lawsuit. If they decide to take on this bureaucratic ordeal, they must post a bond worth double the amount claimed in the lawsuit, according to the Canadian Produce Marketing Association. Then they are in a pickle, if I may say so. I am not just using that expression because we are talking about produce. In short, they are in a pickle and the major buyers know it. As a result, companies are forced to negotiate downward with the buyer, because they would still rather receive a fraction of the value of the fruits of their labour than nothing at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962071">The U.S. is demanding that Canada provide protection similar to that offered by the U.S. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act before it will again give Canadian producers access to its program. Passing the bill we have before us today will provide protection not only for our producers doing business domestically, but also, with a little good faith on the part of the U.S. administration, for those doing business with American buyers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962072">I just want to point out here that the U.S. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act was adopted in the 1930s, so it is high time we adopted a similar mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962073">I hope you will agree with me, Mr. Speaker, especially since you are my MP during House sitting weeks. I live in your riding while we are working here in Parliament. I hope you will hear my plea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962074">Over the course of many Parliaments, many committees have recommended implementing just such a measure. The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, which studied the bill, sent it back to the House without amendment. The committee approved it, with support from all the parties. Action on this is long overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962075">Before concluding, I want to make an aside and draw the House's attention to another issue related to food products and the difficulties that certain players in the supply chain may experience when a buyer goes bankrupt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962076">In my riding, there is a storage company that found itself in a difficult situation a few months ago. This company provides refrigeration and freezer services and serves as an intermediary in the transportation of perishable goods. After one of its clients went bankrupt, a bakery, the company ended up stuck with about 800 pallets of pies that did not belong to it. Since the bakery in question was under the authority of a trustee in bankruptcy at the time, the storage company could not dispose of the pies in any way. The situation went on for several weeks, causing major financial losses for the storage company since it could not get any income from the merchandise in question and it could not take on other contracts because the cargo was taking up half of its warehouse. The bakery finally hired a company to transport the stored merchandise, but that company was never paid for services rendered. The transportation company then turned to the intermediary, the storage company, for compensation for its losses, which put the storage company's financial viability at great risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962061">At that point, I wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and his parliamentary secretary. That was before the cabinet shuffle. The letter was cosigned by the Bloc Québécois transport critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278741" Type="2">Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères</Affiliation>. We felt that the intermediary was also a victim of the situation, and we asked the minister to consider including a provision in the Bills of Lading Act that would protect intermediaries responsible for goods in specific cases involving bankruptcy of the original business. Such situations become even trickier when perishable goods are involved, and I would like to take this opportunity to get everyone thinking about this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962062">In closing, to get back to the subject of my speech, let us pass this bill without delay, as its co-sponsor entreated us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962080">This bill has already been the subject of many committee studies. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> said recently that he has almost lost count of how many times, at different committees in different Parliaments, the bill has been considered. He went on to say that we have seen a recommendation for this type of measure to be enacted by the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962081">The time is now. My NDP colleagues and I would like to see this bill pass through third reading to get to the Senate and start getting the traction it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962082">The Fruit and Vegetable Growers of Canada, the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, and the thousands of people they represent want that too. They are waiting for action. I reiterate the news from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation>, as well as the NDP caucus, that we look forward to the bill's speedy passage to the other place. We hope that it finds its way to the Governor General's desk to receive the royal assent quickly, because climate change is not waiting for government process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962083">Climate change is affecting growing seasons, shipping times and supply chains. It is contributing to Canada's ongoing infrastructure deficit. During the drastic flooding in B.C. due to an atmospheric river, B.C. got a first-hand view of how fragile Canadian supply chains are, because they rely on open roads, railways and ports. Let us add the black swan event of the global pandemic to supply chain challenges. Such black swan events are coming more often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962084">Since the start of the pandemic, it has been more difficult to transport goods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, which have short lifespans and need just-in-time logistics. With small profit margins, alongside big impacts on food security, any wasting of food directly affects the bottom line of farmers and producers, and it limits how we get food on tables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962085">Many farmers in Canada are feeling the stresses of trying to make ends meet in this volatile business. They feel the pressure of feeding not only Canadians but also the world. Right now, the government does not have their backs when something out of their control affects their bottom line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962086">In Canada, we depend on farmers and producers to feed our communities. Food sovereignty is a life-or-death business, and we cannot leave farmers and producers without a safety net if we are serious about protecting food sovereignty in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962087">The fresh fruit and vegetable industry has been calling for support to prevent farms from going bankrupt because of the lack of protection. In the supply chain specifically, it would be very beneficial. Supply chains are becoming more and more unreliable because of climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962088">Food loss because of supply chain limitations cannot happen fully on the backs of those who grow and produce our food. We need farmers and producers to thrive so that people can eat healthy, affordable food. Food spoilage is not only incredibly expensive, but it is also harmful to the environment. It contributes to climate change. Farmers and producers need protection from that. The Liberal government needs to get serious about helping farmers reduce wasted food and recover from any losses that are out of their control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962089">Food waste alone increases carbon dioxide and biomethane emissions, contributing to a warming planet. With more droughts, fires and floods, farmers and producers become more susceptible to these events. It is more challenging to get food from farm to table. Producers, suppliers and retailers must all be supported and encouraged to help get food to tables. However, let us get back to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962090">Farmers and producers of fresh fruit and vegetables are taking incredible risks and hits to their viability, with an increased risk of filing for bankruptcy. For example, Canadian producers and growers selling to markets in the United States once had equal access to payment protection under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Since 2014, however, they have not been allowed to file a formal claim under PACA until after they post a bond of double the value of their original shipment. This is an expensive, risky ask when product shipments can be delayed and affected by many different points of the supply chain.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962091">In addition, let us talk about the risks of natural water resources in Canada becoming scarcer. The amount of water and the number of water restrictions are putting a strain on farmers and producers, adding costs and risks to their businesses. They need government support as they deal with these mounting risks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962092">New Democrats have supported and will continue to support farmers and producers. In 2015, the New Democrats' federal election platform promised to “introduce a payment protection program for produce growers”, and we mean it, among other measures to keep farms in their stewards' hands and to allow those businesses to make the money they deserve. Protection for our farmers is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962093">Canadian farmers are essential workers. During the pandemic, they continued to work to keep our stores supplied. As large grocery store chains continued to make record profits, they downloaded costs and risks to their suppliers. Farmers and producers suffered, with no legislated support. That lack of a safety net needs to be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962094">I will close by saying this bill is imperative to reduce the risk for farmers and producers and to assist them in remaining viable. As climate change continues to negatively impact food security and food sovereignty, we need our farmers.</ParaText>

I know that the member for York—Simcoe represents Holland Marsh, which is known as the soup and salad bowl of Canada. The reality is that Bill C-280 would not only be support for fruit and vegetable growers and producers in this region but also all across Canada. That is why I am so excited to support this bill today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962097">As a former farmer myself, I know that farming is not just a business, but it is a way of life for many Canadian families from coast to coast. This way of life is not an easy one. There are significant risks and uncertainties that farm families take on every year to grow food that feeds the world. Producers face many uncertainties every year, including unpredictable commodity prices, Mother Nature and the ability to obtain revenue for their product. Producers are forced to work within a very limited growing cycle and one bad year could put the family farm business at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962098">One of the most significant things that can impact a producer is when a purchaser of their product declares bankruptcy. When a buyer declares bankruptcy, the impacts to the producer can be devastating. Many of the farmers I represent are grain, pulse and cattle farmers. While this bill would not directly impact them, they understand the importance of protecting producers from the insolvency of businesses that purchase their product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962099">When I was a young farmer, a few years ago, I was in a situation where our local grain buyer became insolvent. The situation was made worse for our farm and others in the area because the insolvent party was not only buying our product but was also selling us inputs for the next year's crop. Preventable moments like this put undue stress on family farm businesses. Because of the seasonal nature of farming, farmers plan months and years in advance to keep their businesses operating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962100">Therefore, when a buyer who is the main purchaser in an area suddenly goes insolvent, this puts undue stress on the entire area. By the way, we are talking about an area the size of P.E.I. That is how big the purchaser of our product was and it did take down the whole region. I am sure members can imagine the uncertainty for this entire area and the undue stress it would have put on farm families. Pricing everything else accordingly while simultaneously tracking inputs so that a farmer can maintain a cost coverage to keep profitable is enough of a challenge. Adding bankruptcy, an entirely separate issue, to the equation can create a whole range of complications, crippling farmers without warning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962101">The way the value chain is designed, it requires the farmer to have a buyer and contracts in place before they even step into the field. That means they need to enter negotiations on how much they will sell their pound of product for, without any guarantee that they will grow a crop. That means the Canadian farmer is forced to be all in. They can do everything right. They can get the product to the buyer's doors and then not get paid for the product. It is a devastating blow for anyone when they do not get paid for the hard work they do every day. While the current mechanisms within the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act may be suitable for the wider agriculture industry and other sectors, the current approach does not work when fresh produce buyers become insolvent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962102">Fruits and vegetables are perishable. The shelf life of these products is not long. This is why the risk of the buyer becoming insolvent is so much more devastating to fruit and vegetable producers. Their products can rarely be recovered because they will have already spoiled. Without the ability to recover the product or access current mechanisms in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, fruit and vegetable producers can face a significant loss that could very easily put them out of business. Imagine the effect this would have on a producer's insurance, their farm and their family. There are only so many hits one can take before the ship starts to sink.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962103">The uncertainty of producers not being paid for their products is very real, but it is also avoidable if we pass this bill into law. Members do not need to just take my word for why this legislation is needed. They can listen to the Canadian fruit and vegetable producers who have rallied behind Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> in support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962104"> Jan VanderHout, the president of the Fruit and Vegetable Growers of Canada, stated that this will have a very positive impact on our national food supply, lowering cost to consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962105">The chair of the Canadian Produce Marketing Association stated that, for too long, Canadian produce growers and sellers have shouldered the financial risk when selling their products. The challenges of the pandemic and the massive increases in costs they have experienced over the past few years have put many in an even more vulnerable position. He hopes that all members of Parliament will vote in favour of this important piece of legislation to support the long-term viability of their sector and send a message to their growers and sellers that we have their backs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962106">While I said there are reasonable protections for producers, there is a lack of protection for them within the banking industry itself. I believe that too often business people, with no understanding of how the agriculture industry operates, undertake uncalculated risks that could undermine the survival of the farms they do business with. That is why I am so grateful to my colleague for bringing this bill forward in the House of Commons and why I am so proudly supporting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962107">As a lifelong farmer, I know that many farmers have faced challenges where they wished there was a mechanism in place to protect from the devastation of an insolvent buyer. It would allow producers to have more protection from the buyers who hold their very livelihoods in their hands. Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> would build that certainty into the financial landscape. This increased certainty would allow for reduced produce costs that could be passed on to the grocery cart of Canadians. With food inflation limiting how many fresh fruits and vegetables Canadians can afford, reduced costs are needed now more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962108">This bill is a practical solution to a very serious problem. Farmers should not have to fear being shortchanged when their buyer goes insolvent. It is a common sense approach for the common people who feed our country and the world. The bottom line is that our agriculture producers need to get paid for what they grow. Anytime that system breaks down, the stabilization of the entire food supply is at risk. If we do not pass this bill, we are continuing to set up our fruit and vegetable producers for failure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962109">Now, more than ever, it is critically important that we send this very clear signal to our agriculture producers across the country. The NDP-Liberal government has neglected farmers for far too long. By passing Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, it has a chance to stand with Canadian producers for once.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962110">In closing, I want to mention that one of Canada's newest vegetable producers, Vermillion Growers, earlier this year opened a state-of-the-art tomato greenhouse in Dauphin, Manitoba. The folks at Vermillion Growers are working tirelessly to become a leader in growing fresh, local produce that will feed Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962111"> I am very fortunate to represent this new business in Parliament, and I know that Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> will support local growers just like them. I hope all members in the House will support Canadian fruit and vegetable producers by passing Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="300663" Type="18">Mr. Chris Bittle (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962112">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to talk about Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, which was first introduced by the member representing the soup and salad bowl of Canada. I know you said not to come up with new riding names, but I think the hon. member appreciates it in this particular case. I would like to thank the member for getting the process started and for the important steps that have already been taken on the way to getting the bill through the parliamentary process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962113">The aim of the bill is to help our fruit and vegetable growers by reducing the financial risks they face. Growers and farmers work hard, take risks and provide Canadians with healthy produce. Furthermore, growers do not get paid in many cases until their produce goes through numerous steps of a long supply chain to get to the consumer. This is risky from a financial perspective, as the bankruptcy or insolvency of any of the players along the supply chain may result in the grower not getting paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962114">The government has taken important steps to make things better for growers and farmers. One example is the passing of the safe food for Canadians regulations in 2018. However, the risk is not completely gone and we can still do more. We heard a lot from witnesses during the bill's study at the agriculture committee that our growers and farmers still face the problem of non-payment if a link in the supply chain becomes bankrupt or insolvent, which is a real risk already, given the tight profit margins. In short, this is why we are supporting Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962115">We in the House agree that this bill is a good idea, but as we heard during the study of it at committee, it is not perfect and there are issues that the government and this House should continue to monitor to ensure that we maximize the bill's potential to assist growers. I note two issues in particular: first, the impact of the bill on access to affordable credit for growers and sellers and the fresh produce supply chain, and second, the potential for the bill to restore Canada's preferential access to the formal dispute resolution process under the United States' Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the PACA, which regulates the fresh produce sector and provides financial protection for sellers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962116">In committee, members heard from a witness who was concerned that the changes made by the bill might make banks less willing to give loans, or they might charge more when lending to fresh produce sellers. This is because the bill would change the creditor priority in insolvency, and such changes could cause lenders to react with high credit costs or lower availability to compensate for higher risks of non-payment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962117">This witness had extensive experience in the fresh produce industry in both Canada and the United States, and his concerns stemmed from the impact that the PACA had south of the border. He explained to the committee that in his experience, U.S. lenders reduced crucial operating credit lines for produce sellers or required additional security, because the PACA deemed trust is paid ahead of all other loans and lines of credit in a bankruptcy or other payment default. It is important to note that the Canadian Bankers Association also raised this when the Department of Industry consulted on this issue several years ago. However, this was a minority view at committee, and most fresh produce industry representatives downplayed these credit risks. The committee gave appropriate weight to their assessment, given their knowledge and experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962118">I am noting the concern here to invite the government to monitor the situation in the months following the entry into force of the legislation so that corrective measures can be taken in a timely manner if Canadian lenders decide to take the same approach as U.S. lenders. Industry witnesses before the committee emphasized the importance of trade credit to the fresh produce supply chain and, as such, I believe we will want to make sure the bill achieves its intended objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962119">A second issue to consider is getting back Canada's preferential access under the PACA. Before 2014, Canadians, like Americans, could use the PACA for free. Unfortunately, in 2014, the U.S. rescinded Canada's preferential access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962120">At this stage, we do not know for sure if passing Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> will result in PACA access being restored, and as far as I know, parliamentarians were not provided with any direct confirmation from the United States. While the committee heard from industry representatives that they believed restoration was likely in that case, this is another area where attention should be paid at the implementation stage. I trust that the government will do all it can to ensure that Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> leads to the restoration of preferential PACA access should the bill become law and will monitor the situation closely and on an ongoing basis. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962121">Finally, I would like to reiterate the point made by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>. Seemingly small legislative adjustments such as Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> can have significant positive impacts on our agricultural community. We should look for other opportunities to help our farmers and growers through regulatory and legislative tweaks, which could have positive impacts without adding more to the budget. The member from Kings—Hants mentioned streamlining regulatory approvals for agricultural products as one example. I look forward to hearing more about this and other ideas from the members of our agricultural community, including the parliamentary secretary, who is very enthusiastic about all things agricultural.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962122">In summary, Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> is a good step toward supporting our hard-working fresh fruit and vegetable growers and making sure Canadians continue to have healthy food on the table. Let us also keep watching to make sure the bill reaches its potential.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962123">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here this evening to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, which was introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation>. He sits next to me here in the House, and he is certainly not afraid to make his voice heard when it comes time to defend our produce growers. The Bloc Québécois is pleased to join him in his efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962124">Many members of the Bloc Québécois would have liked to sponsor this bill. I am thinking, for example, of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> or the member for <Affiliation DbId="278185" Type="2">Salaberry—Suroît</Affiliation>. I, too, could have introduced this bill, because there are a lot of produce growers in my riding of Mirabel. The bill could have also been introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> or the member for <Affiliation DbId="278377" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation>. In short, we all care a lot about this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962125">I therefore want to thank my colleague. There are some nice moments in Parliament when we can say that we are working together to do important things. Perhaps this should have been done sooner. This also reminds us of the importance of private members' bills, because they are inspired by what we see on the ground, by the people and businesses in our ridings. It reminds us of the fundamental work that members must do on the ground. I truly commend my colleague and, obviously, he is invited to come visit the maple capital of the world, Mirabel, any time he likes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962126">Produce growers, meaning fruit and vegetable producers, are still facing major challenges that continue to grow. We have talked about production costs, the cost of fertilizers and raw materials, and the declining demand for certain niche products as people struggle to afford things that can sometimes be perceived as luxuries at the grocery store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962127">We have talked about the Conservatives running deficit after deficit when they were in government. Things went from bad to worse under the Liberals. They are the kings of deficits. We have talked about bargaining power. Sometimes, small producers have to negotiate with resellers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962128">Bad weather is also a factor. I met some produce growers this summer as part of the Canada summer jobs program. I visited some businesses. I met Léanne and Vincent from the Entre Ciel et Terre farm in Sainte‑Anne‑des‑Plaines, Stéphanie from the Complètement légume farm in Saint‑Augustin, and Cinthya from Tierra Viva Gardens in Saint‑Augustin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962129">As we walked around the plots, they told us that they had lost 100%, 50% or 75% of this or that crop because of the rains. These people do not make a lot of money. They are true artisans. This serves as a reminder, and we cannot stress this enough, of the need for compensation programs here in Ottawa. However, that file is not moving forward quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962130">We can talk about the difficulties associated with climate change, bad weather, labour shortages, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the issue of temporary foreign workers, which creates challenges for our businesses. Then, there is foreign competition, obviously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962131">It is important to protect these companies when they sell their produce to resellers. How does the current system work? The member for York—Simcoe helped me gain a better understanding of how it works when someone is a fruit and vegetable grower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962132">Say that an American grows apples and sells them to a grocery store, to a reseller. If the grocery store goes bankrupt, this American has protection. He is registered as a supplier and, if the grocery store goes bankrupt, the government recognizes the fact that, since the supplier has not been paid, these fruits and vegetables belong to him and he is immediately reimbursed. That is the American system. Until 2014, Canadian and Quebec producers benefited from this system because they could sell their produce in the United States. If they sold to a grocery store in the U.S. and the grocery store or chain went bankrupt, they could get reimbursed the same way. This meant that we were relying on the Americans to protect our own producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962133">In 2014, the Americans looked at what Canada was doing and found that Canada was in bad shape, that it had a terrible approach. They realized that their producers would not be protected if they sold their produce in Canada. If a Canadian grocery store or reseller went bankrupt, the producers would not get paid unless they went through an extremely costly process, which no small producer would go through if they could avoid it. Logically speaking, our own farmers were not protected either. The Americans told us to wake up, smarten up and protect our farmers and theirs so that there could be some sort of reciprocity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7962134">In 2014, when the Americans tried to clue us in and told us that they were sick of protecting our farmers for us, they thought this would make the Canadian government sit up. They thought they were alerting Canada to take action. What has happened since? Cue the crickets, because nothing happened. The federal government did nothing. Now our farmers are no longer protected either in the United States or here at home. That is tough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962135">In 2016, we had a new Prime Minister who said, “Canada is back”. That was two years later. He went to the Fruit and Vegetable Growers of Canada and promised to get Canadian farmers back into this U.S. program, which would require Canada to adopt certain measures. Then the same old thing happened that always happens with the federal government when things are urgent: it waited and waited and waited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962136">Today, a courageous MP decided he would table these changes in the government's place. All of us members who have farmers in our riding are proud of that. We are proud to support him. We think this bill should have been fast-tracked directly to the Senate. We think there should not have been any nonsense. We think that there has been enough nonsense since 2014, and this process should have gone faster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962137">Right now, if our farmers want help, there are mechanisms. For example, in the United States, they have to file suit. There is a mechanism requiring them to pay a deposit worth twice the amount of the claim. They do not have the means to do that. The idea is to deter them so they never get paid for their fruits and vegetables and the products they sold to a reseller. It is disrespectful to the farmers who feed us and feed our cities. I want to stress that part for those who do not represent agricultural ridings. We are all connected to those farmers in some way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962138">Not only is it disrespectful, but it is also completely out of touch with the reality of being a farmer. Farmers have plenty to do without having to go to court, hire lawyers and waste their time on administrative procedures. Farmers are on the ground, dealing with all the problems I listed. They are in the fields, the orchards and the greenhouses. They take care of their businesses and their workers. They deal with temporary foreign worker applications while Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada takes its sweet time and the federal government does nothing to make the system better. That is what they do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962139">This bill will make their lives easier. It is going to restore justice. It is going to reduce the risks they bear in one of the riskiest sectors on the market. As we can see, it is getting harder and harder to attract new farmers, because it is not easy work. I want to thank the bill's sponsor for making all this easier for our farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962140">The bill will make the buyer of these products liable for the value of the shipment. The shipment will not belong to the buyer until the invoice has been paid. There will be a kind of priority list so that, if the person who has ordered agricultural products but has not paid their invoice goes bankrupt, the producer will be assured of getting paid without much trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962141">Right now, the system says that farmers have the right to get paid. Fifteen days after the bankruptcy, they have the right to recover the goods that were sold 30 days before. Do members see how little sense that makes for the agricultural industry? If any member of the House is opposed to this bill, I would challenge them to eat a 45-day-old salad or some withered old strawberries or blueberries. They can do it in the lobby and I will film it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962142">Under the current system, what we are telling farmers is to take back their rotten produce. That is how we are treating them. The current system is rotten. It needs to be changed. We need to move forward on this. This bill needs to move forward. The Senate needs to pay close attention to this so that this bill is passed quickly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962145">The deemed trust established by this bill will also support the highly integrated produce trade between Canada and the United States. Farmers and other suppliers in Canada have been pushing for these measures for almost 20 years.

I trust that legislators in that other place with the red carpet, who can be a little slow sometimes, will deal with it promptly, given the multi-party support for these measures. Like we say in York—Simcoe, “Be ready, Senators”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962151">Right now, Canadians are dealing with the high cost of food. With Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document> and other measures, the government has been talking about stabilizing food prices. Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> is going to lower prices of fresh fruits and vegetables that Canadians need now, so we all need to get behind this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962152">Too often Canadians, especially rural Canadians, think we cannot work together in this place. They think we cannot get anything done and they believe that whatever is accomplished does not have any relevance to or impact on their lives. In rural communities, people band together every day. They are the foundation of what it means to be Canadian. They want to see this place work for them, they want to see the way it works for one another. I firmly believe that Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> sends a message to every produce farmer and supplier that we understand the issues they face and that we are committed to addressing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962153">The hard work of passing this bill is nothing compared to the boots in the muck in the Holland Marsh, which all farmers face right across Canada, but I can tell colleagues this. We are going to get behind them with this bill. We are going to get it done. Let us get Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> passed for the farmers right across Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962159">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to follow up on a question I raised in the House on September 29. As we all do in this place, I value the time that I get to spend on the ground with my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962160">It is only outside of the Ottawa bubble and with the workers of this country that parliamentarians can truly appreciate the challenges Canadians are facing and the sacrifices they are making, especially at this time, to keep our economy afloat. I saw this on full display this summer and fall as I travelled in my riding of Yorkton—Melville.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962161">At harvest time, farmers and producers are at work from well before the sunrise to well into the night. They do what it takes to get the job done. They form the backbone of our economy. Their success is Canada’s success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962162">In turn, setbacks that they face create a ripple effect across our country and, indeed, across the globe. We live in Canada. I come from Saskatchewan. As all my constituents know, especially the farmers and ranchers that I represent, winter comes upon us quickly and lasts a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962163">Farmers and producers, therefore, meticulously plan out their year to account for the unpredictability of weather, supply chains and yields. However, there are often matters outside of their control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962164">Right now, they are facing a critical shortage of feed for their breeding herds after a year of drought. Precipitation remained well below normal throughout this summer, particularly in western Saskatchewan. As a result, moisture deficits have taken a critical toll on pastures and forage ranges. Livestock producers face tough choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962165">Some may even have to sell a portion of their herds to sustain the remainder through the winter. However, this is not an option for all producers. If they do not have the means or the source to feed their animals in the short term, herds will suffer, and Canadians will face food shortages and higher prices. Ranching families could face business failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962166">For months now, the Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association has been just one group sounding the alarm, asking the federal and provincial governments to step up with their share of the AgriRecovery relief, to help livestock producers navigate the extraordinary burden they take on when natural disasters occur.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962167">The Government of Saskatchewan can be praised for its concern and fast action to protect Canada’s food security and the livelihoods of our ranching communities. Two months ago, it committed $70 million, or $80 per head, to sustain breeding stocks. However, the silence from the federal government has been deafening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962168">It has yet to commit its share of AgriRecovery funding. My constituents are rightly raising some difficult questions. Is Ottawa ignoring them? Does the government want them to fail? Has it forgotten about them or, by some calculation, determined that there is no need for assistance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962169">As their voice in this place, let me be very clear: There is an urgent need here and time is running out. I am asking again today for the Government of Canada to immediately make available its share of AgriRecovery funding, $120 per head, which will sustain precious breeding herds into the winter. The government must do its part to ensure that families from coast to coast have continued access to the high-quality food Saskatchewan’s livestock producers provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962170">I understand that the federal government and the Province of Saskatchewan have been in consultation and were working on a review to determine how AgriRecovery could best assist the livestock industry. I must say, respectfully, that Saskatchewan has stepped up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962171">The time for consultation is long over. The government has pointed farmers and ranchers to the support available through this program as the answer in the past, and yet, it has not acted now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962172">My constituents go above and beyond to feed our country. They deserve the courtesy of a straight answer.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962173">Mr. Speaker, since this is my first chance to take part in a discussion with you in the chair, I want to congratulate you on your new role. I want you to know that you have my full respect and confidence, as is my duty as an MP.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7962174">I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278361" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation> for this opportunity to talk about our support for producers in Saskatchewan who are impacted by severe drought conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962175">Our hearts go out to producers during these extremely challenging times. With winter coming, cattle producers are facing difficult decisions about their herds, and many producers have suffered lower grain yields because of drought. We are talking about the cumulative damage of multiple years of drought on pastures and forage production, leading to low feed supply for livestock producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962176">To address the member's question, the federal government is working as quickly as possible with the Saskatchewan government on AgriRecovery, and we will have more to say on this very soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962177">AgriRecovery allows federal, provincial and territorial governments to work together when natural disasters like this occur. Just so the producers understand, this is not a federal- or provincial-only decision. Both the province and the federal assessors get together and make an assessment based on the AgriRecovery framework they have both signed on to, with a five-year agreement, to say yes, this is a natural disaster or drought that has impacted our producers, and they work within that framework. We have a lot of experience, unfortunately, with the B.C. floods and with hurricane Fiona. In fact, this is something that both provincial assessors and federal assessors have too much experience with because of climate change disasters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962178">Producers can help write down this income by claiming the cost of buying new breeding animals for the following year. This will reduce the tax burden from the original sale. Again, the goal is to help producers who are facing difficult herd management decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962179">Saskatchewan producers also have access to all of our business risk management programs. Business risk management programs are the first line of defence for producers facing disasters like this one. Our government has already supported Saskatchewan's request for an increase to the interim payment rate of AgriStability from 50% to 75%. We have increased the compensation rate for AgriStability from 70% to 80%, starting with the 2023 program year. That means more support in times of need. We have also partnered with the province on a one-year adjustment to the AgriInsurance program to make more drought-damaged crops available for feed. The vast majority of Saskatchewan producers enrolled in forage insurance have received payments, and 60% of their premiums are covered by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962180">My message is that our government is here for Saskatchewan farmers. They deserve and have our unwavering support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962181">I have been to Saskatchewan. The <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has been to Saskatchewan.

              <ParaText id="7962182">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind words, but they are not enough. Producers are desperate right now. The Province of Saskatchewan has come forward, so there must be some kind of an agreement in place. This money is cash flow they need to move forward. We are in October. We are talking about a desperate need for food for breeding cattle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962183">The time for federal assistance has long passed. I am tired of hearing “It's coming soon”. It is not coming soon. Saskatchewan's cattlemen and livestock producers need a federal government that is there for them during these hard times. This is one of those hard times. They are not new to drought, but this is very desperate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962188">Mr. Speaker, on October 5, when speaking to the issue of foreign interference in Canada, I asked the government to enlighten the House about whether there has been any credible or clear evidence for the government to stand up for Canadians and combat foreign interference by the Chinese Communist Party, or has it decided to embark on a diversionary conflict with another country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962189">Today, we have seen real and actual evidence come forward outlining foreign interference in Canada by Chinese and Iranian operatives. There are Canadian citizens who have come to Canada from these two communities and who have been subjected to intimidation, to stalking and to being threatened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962190"> After months of delaying and refusing to acknowledge the existence or the extent of the activities of foreign operatives, the government botched the creation of a selective public inquiry led by a former governor general. After that debacle, we saw the establishment of the Hogue inquiry, which appears to operate more in secret than do foreign operatives. Meanwhile, Canadians continue to be left in the dark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962191"> Furthermore, Canadians are wondering why there has been such a prolonged reluctance by the government to own up to the existence of foreign interference. It is not an entirely new phenomenon. Is the governing party somehow in on it? Is there some kind of benefit to turning a blind eye? The setting up of Chinese police stations really should have been a good clue on foreign interference. Additionally, media reports about Iranian Canadians being stalked and threatened would have been another dead giveaway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962192">While the government continues to drag its feet with respect to getting to the bottom of foreign interference in Canada, it has moved to muddy the waters even more by launching an attack on another democracy over the murder of a Canadian Sikh leader in British Columbia. Both the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the New Democratic Party</Affiliation> have indicated that they have either credible or clear evidence allegedly pointing to another democracy. However, Canadians have a great deal of support for the rule of law and for due process. One would think that rather than spout unsubstantiated claims of what they allegedly possess on the case, these two political leaders would also have such belief in Canadian law. In fact, if they possess any evidence, they have a duty to provide it to the appropriate authorities who are investigating this horrible crime. They do not have the authority to utter questionable statements. They do have a responsibility to present the evidence, and a Canadian court will decide on its value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962193">Canadian political leaders cannot supplement our justice system and become judge, jury and executioner. Nor can they bring Canada's foreign reputation into question. Such irresponsible action has caused real economic, trade and transit problems for Canadians, as well as a diplomatic war of expulsions that soured our relations within another country. Conversely, given the speed of the unfounded accusations and lack of real evidence, Canadians would have loved to have seen such zeal for combatting Iran, China and the foreign interference from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962194">Perhaps, in the political rush by both the Liberal Party and the NDP to garner Sikh votes in British Columbia, all rational, legal and diplomatic thought went out the window. Besides, as they say, never let the facts interfere with a possible election victory.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962195">Mr. Speaker, obviously the Government of Canada takes any allegation of foreign interference extremely seriously. The <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has personally engaged with Chinese counterparts on this issue, as the hon. member well knows, and we will never tolerate any form of foreign interference in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962196">As my hon. colleague is aware, in May of this year, after careful consideration, we declared <I>persona non grata</I> Mr. Zhao Wei, who held the position of consul at the consulate-general of the People's Republic of China in Toronto. In August, our government publicized information about a disinformation campaign on WeChat that targeted the member of Parliament from <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>. This campaign centred on spreading false narratives about his identity, including commentary and claims about his background, political stances and family heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962197">We assessed that it was highly probable that China played a role in this campaign, and we raised strong objections about this activity with China's ambassador to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962198">Over the past year we have also raised strong objections with China's ambassador regarding the overseas police stations in Canada and demanded their closure. The RCMP has reported that these stations are no longer operational, and the RCMP is the right authority to act on that, not politicians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962199">Foreign interference emanating from China and other countries is a significant danger to Canada's sovereignty, prosperity and social fabric. We will continue to do everything that is necessary to protect Canadians from this threat. Canada will continue to uphold global laws that have ensured global stability since the end of the Second World War, and we will continue to work with our allies on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962200">Canada remains firm in our resolve that defending Canada's democracy is of the utmost importance. We have stated time and time again that foreign interference activities in Canada are in violation of Canada's sovereignty and are unacceptable. The government, our government, will continue to choose the most effective tools from the wide range of options at our disposal to properly combat foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962201">As the hon. member knows, there is an ongoing public inquiry on foreign interference with a focus on examining and assessing interference by China, Russia and other actors, in our last two federal elections. Our government has also established a national counter-foreign interference coordinator and office within Public Safety Canada, which includes oversight for economic security. As he knows, budget 2023 allocated $13.5 million for this purpose. The same budget allocated $48.9 million to the RCMP over three years to help protect Canadians against harassment and intimidation from authoritarian regimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962202">We will continue to work with allies. The fact that there is foreign interference, whether it is in Canada, the U.S. or other allied countries, is not new. We must continue working with our allies. We will continue to work with our proper authorities, like the RCMP, whether they are CSIS, CSE or our other security agencies across Canada, to ensure that foreign interference is not present in Canada, but we must continue working with our allies across the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962207">The reality is that there are Canadians, whether of Iranian heritage, of Chinese heritage or of a number of diaspora communities, who are at risk, have been intimidated or are being threatened. They have raised those concerns, and all they have been met with is a lot of rhetoric, a lot of good talk and no action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962209"> Foreign interference is an issue. It is not unique to Canada but happening in a superpower such as the U.S., in France and in the U.K. We must always work with our allies to ensure that foreign influence, whether from China, Russia or Iran, is combatted among and with our allies. That is the only way we will be successful in making sure that foreign interference is gone from Canada. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962210">Mr. Speaker, I rose on September 20 on behalf of farmers in northwest British Columbia in an appeal to the <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> to come to their aid immediately after a disastrous summer that had affected many family farms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962211">This goes back to the spring. Farmers knew very early on that there was a problem, because their crops of hay were not growing. By July, they knew how bad this problem was. In fact, after months of a class-five drought, farmers were in a situation where they were getting as little as 10% of their normal hay harvests. We have seen this across all the western provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962212">I wrote to the former minister of agriculture back in July, appealed to her, raised this issue and asked for immediate help for farmers who were in a crisis. We were losing family farms. We were seeing farmers have to sell off their herds. We did not hear back from the minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962213">Then I met with the current <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> on September 19, told him about the situation and asked where the help was. He said that he had not even heard about the crisis and was not aware of any application from British Columbia. Of course, that application had been sitting on his desk for months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962214">I do not want to hear that help will be coming soon or that the government is working on it. My question for my hon. colleague across the way is this: On what day will farmers in northwest British Columbia finally get the support from the federal government that they deserve?</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="300670" Type="18">Mr. Francis Drouin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7962215">Mr. Speaker, obviously, when farmers go through droughts or climate change events, it is serious. Unfortunately, they are going through this too often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962216">The good news, although it is unfortunate, is that whether provincial or federal assessors, they are getting too used to assessing climate change events through the AgriRecovery programs. As my hon. colleague would know, with respect to AgriRecovery, when a request is made, the province will send a letter to the federal government asking for an assessment. The province and the federal government will do the assessment together and assess whether it fits into the framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962217">The hon. member knows that there are business risk management programs. Farmers already have access to that through the sustainable Canadian agricultural partnership program. I know he knows that. Whether farmers go through a climate change event, have a bad year or have a bad crop, whatever the reason for it, they already have access to the business risk management program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962218"> After that, when the risk gets higher, if it is shared among other farmers, then the province gets access to the AgriRecovery framework. As I explained, the province would write a letter to the federal government requesting an assessment that they would do jointly as to whether it does respect the framework they have assigned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962219">For instance, I know the hon. member would know about the B.C. floods a few years ago. Many farmers went through hardships. I know many dairy farmers did. I was in the Fraser Valley, which was flooded, where farmers were growing fruits and vegetables. Some were raising livestock, which unfortunately had to be killed because of the major floods that happened. With respect to public safety, the province and the federal government worked together, and then AgriRecovery kicked in to ensure that the other losses that were not covered by the regular programs would have covered the existent losses that farmers were not eligible for through existing programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962220">I can assure the member that, whether it is with respect to the B.C. floods or the hurricane in P.E.I. and Nova Scotia, the timeline will be respected. I know that when farmers are facing a crisis, it can never be fast enough. It is the same thing with insurance; when we are facing a crisis, it can never be fast enough. However, I assure you that the federal government and the B.C. government take to heart the fact that farmers are facing a crisis and will be there with good news to tell B.C. farmers in the northern part of the province. Farmers will be happy with the results. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962223">Mr. Speaker, I do not think the three dairy farmers who had to sell their farms are going to be happy with the results. I do not think the many beef farmers who had to sell off their herds are going to be happy with the results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962224">I will tell members a couple of characteristics of a government that takes a crisis seriously. First of all, when a member of Parliament writes to a minister, they write back. Second, when the provincial government and the farmers of the region come to the federal government and say there is a crisis, it does not take three months to make something happen. It is October, and we still do not have help. Farmers do not have feed. They have sold off their animals, and we are losing a significant amount of our regional food security because the government, 4,000 kilometres away, is dragging its feet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7962225">What is his message? I want to know what the parliamentary secretary's message is to the farmers in my region who have lost their family farms. Tell me.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7962227">As I have said before, no response is fast enough when someone is going through a crisis. However, I can assure the hon. member that the B.C. government and the federal government are working hand in hand to respond as quickly as possible to farmers in order to ensure that they get the proper response. I can assure the hon. member's farmers, as they have gone through the B.C. floods in 2021, that they will be compensated with the program, through AgriRecovery. We will respond in due time. All I am asking for is patience for a few more days. I know they will get a proper response in a short few days.</ParaText>
