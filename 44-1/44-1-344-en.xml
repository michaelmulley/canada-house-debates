If passed, this bill will add to the Criminal Code the offence of wilfully promoting hatred against indigenous peoples by condoning, denying, justifying or downplaying the harm caused by the residential school system in Canada, calling irrefutable historical facts into question, a genocidal project that was recognized as such unanimously in the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564181">This petition has several calls to action, including implementing temporary processing measures for Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers recognized by the UNHCR to be offered resettlement to Canada; granting temporary visas for evacuees to travel; urgently pushing the two rival factions to impose a temporary ceasefire to ensure the safe and adequate delivery of humanitarian aid; and calling upon bordering countries to open secure corridors to facilitate humanitarian aid, in addition to several other requests.</ParaText>

In good part as a result of that, but also because of the interests of non-Indo-Canadian community members, we have seen a much higher demand for international flights going to Europe and, in particular, directly to India from Winnipeg. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564188">The petitioners have signed this petition in the hope that the federal government, the provinces, airport authorities and airlines will give extra consideration to that growth and look at having more direct flights.</ParaText>

The petitioners outline that parental alienation is a discredited and unscientific theory used in family court to silence survivors of family violence and often goes against children's wishes. The petitioners would like the government to amend the Divorce Act to make accusations of parental alienation inadmissible in parenting time disputes.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564195">He said: Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278214" Type="2">Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564196">There was a time when every young person in Canada could hope to one day own their own home, a place to call their own, where they could raise a family. There was a time when those young people could dream of a positive future for their children. They could think that one day their children would be able to fulfill the dream of buying a home, that they would live in a country where they could make their hopes and dreams come true and become what they wanted to be, whether here or elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564197">Sadly, that is no longer the case. Unfortunately, too often, young families are turning to food banks because they can no longer afford groceries at the end of the month. Today's young families are worried about the safety of their children. That is the case in Montreal, where people are worried about sending their children to day care because supervised injection sites have set up shop next door to schools and day cares. Today, young families are even struggling to find a place to live because the cost of housing has doubled over the past nine years as a result of this Liberal government's policies, which were supported by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564198">The Canada that most of us here aspired to no longer exists, all because of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s nine years of inflationary, centralizing and disastrous policies. Now he is being propped up by the Bloc Québécois and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564199">Like me, the majority of Quebeckers and Canadians are probably extremely disappointed today. They are extremely disappointed because this Prime Minister is not currently at Rideau Hall, in front of the Governor General, asking for the dissolution of his government. He would have to make that request in English, by the way, because the Governor General still does not speak French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564200">That is what should have happened. That is what Canadians wanted. That is what Quebeckers wanted. Unfortunately, the NDP and the Bloc Québécois would rather stay the course, to borrow one of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s favourite phrases. They would rather see Quebeckers and Canadians go further into debt. They would rather watch the cost of everything, from food to housing, keep going up. They would rather implement policies that allow criminals to stay home watching Netflix than put them behind bars. This is the sad reality today, and it is the result of the NDP and Bloc's shameful decision to vote against this motion of non-confidence in this bad government. It is a bad government for Quebeckers. It is a bad government for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564201">It is surprising to see that the Bloc Québécois chose to support this government that is bad for Quebec, considering it was the Bloc leader himself who said on May 23: “The government has two choices then. It can hold off on its aggressive centralization agenda, its abuse of the fiscal imbalance and abuse of spending power until the end of its mandate, which would normally run until late 2025, or it can call an election now to try to obtain that type of mandate”. On May 23, the leader of the Bloc Québécois wanted an election because this government was interfering in provincial responsibilities, because this government was bad for Quebec. Suddenly, yesterday, the Bloc Québécois chose to prop up the most centralist, controversial, spendthrift government ever, a government that is bad for Quebec. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8564202">I would like to quote again from the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation>'s May 23 speech. He said the Liberal Prime Minister “has no right to dupe Canadians or the parties in the House. As I said before, if the Prime Minister is so interested in the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces, he can go off and pursue a career in provincial politics, preferably in Ontario.” We certainly do not want him in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564203">Yesterday, the Bloc members had the opportunity to send the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> off to make the leap to provincial politics. Yesterday, they had the opportunity to stand up for Quebeckers and put their money where their mouths are. It is time to walk the talk, as the saying goes. Unfortunately, that is not what they did. The Bloc Québécois made its choice. It saved this bad Liberal government. It had an easy choice to make yesterday. It had a choice between putting Canadians ever deeper in debt, doubling the cost of housing and increasing the cost of food, and calling an election to bring in a common-sense government, a government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564204">Why do we need to axe the tax? Canadians are earning less and paying more for nearly everything because of this Prime Minister's deficits and inflationary taxes. The costly “Liberal Bloc” has added $500 billion in inflationary spending. The Bloc voted to keep the Prime Minister in place 188 times, and it did it again yesterday. Because of these taxes, Canadians have less money in their pockets and their paycheques are getting weaker and weaker. Canada's per capita GDP has declined for the fifth quarter in a row. It has fallen 3.6% since 2022. By comparison with our neighbours to the south, their per capita GDP has risen 4.5% since 2022. Talk about a gap. To put it more simply, had Canada simply kept pace with the United States over the past two years, our economy would be 8.5% higher. This represents an extra $6,200 per Canadian per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564205">It is important to put more money in Quebeckers' pockets while rejecting policies that would cost them more. We know this government is obsessed with making Canadians and Quebeckers part with more and more of their money, including through gas taxes. The Bloc Québécois is fine with Quebeckers paying more in gas taxes. With carbon tax 2, the Bloc Québécois wants Quebeckers to pay an extra 17¢ a litre. There is just no denying that. Bloc members have been very clear. According to them, even that is not enough. They want to radically increase gas taxes for all Quebeckers and Canadians. The reality is that the Bloc Québécois shares the same views, goals and agenda as the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564206">The Journal de Montréal reports that food insecurity is no longer a problem that only affects the poor. La Presse reports that one in 10 Quebeckers uses food banks and that Quebec's food banks serve 872,000 people each month. Yesterday, the Bloc Québécois voted to continue down this path. As I said earlier, we need to build the homes. To me, it is mind-boggling that the Bloc Québécois wants to keep standing in the way of young people's dreams of home ownership. Canada's inflation in the house price-to-income ratio is higher than any other G7 country. We need an election so that Quebeckers can put a roof over their heads. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564207">We need to fix the budget and implement measures like finding a dollar of savings for every dollar we propose to spend on a new program. That is common sense. We cannot keep piling debt on our generation and on the next seven or eight generations as well. As for inflation, Quebec leads the pack. Finally, to stop the crime, I think the Bloc Québécois should quit going after law-abiding hunters and try to join the Conservative Party's efforts to target the real criminals and keep them behind bars. The time has come for a common-sense Conservative government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564248"> I have to say that although I did not know about this particular opposition motion until recently, I came to the topic well prepared today. Back home in my riding, I write a weekly MP report to my constituents, as I am certain many others in this place do as well. For the past few weeks I wrote extensively about this particular topic, as I knew, we all knew, it would be coming up in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564249"> On September 4, I of course wrote about the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>'s tearing up his agreement with the Liberal government. When it came to answering a question on what it would mean to have an election, here is what I wrote: “The NDP can, and I suspect likely will, continue to vote with the...Liberal government”. Well, it is almost like I am psychic. Who could have possibly predicted that the NDP leader would continue to stand with the Liberal government after the great theatrical performance of tearing up the agreement?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564250">When I was asked why I thought the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> staged the theatrical performance, here is what I wrote in response: “In my view, the Leader of the NDP is responding to criticism for what has been his current NDP strategy of bitterly condemning and complaining about things...Liberals do outside the House of Commons that the NDP fully supports when inside the House of Commons.” Once again it was an almost psychic reading of the NDP leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564251">Often I like to ask my local citizens a question at the conclusion of my report. The following week I asked the question, “If given the chance to participate in a non-confidence vote on [this Liberal] government, would you opt for an election now or prefer to wait until October 2025?” I suspect it will not surprise any member of this place to learn that an overwhelming number of Canadians want a carbon tax election, and that they want it now. The fact that even the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> says he no longer stands with a carbon tax speaks volumes. I mention these things because I now can say with complete and total certainty that the good people I represent want a carbon tax election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564252">Let me go back to the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>. Imagine for a moment that he broadcasts his own radio talk show. If people ever wanted to know about the incompetent and bad performance of the Liberal government, they could tune in to the NDP leader's AM radio show, as it would be 24-7 talking about just how bad the Liberal government is. It is the same Liberal government about which the NDP leader said, “The fact is, the Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564253">The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> is clear that the government is the enabler of corporate greed. Let us for a moment surmise that everything the NDP leader says is true. When it comes to the Liberal government's incompetence, he is not really that far off. However, here is the thing. Who is the greatest enabler of the Liberal government? It is, wait for it, the leader of the NDP. I know that is hard to believe. How can someone say that a Liberal government is so incompetent and yet still support the Liberal government every single day? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564254">Once again, this week we learned that after all of the great theatrics, the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> still stands with the Liberals. It is such a totally nonsensical situation to say, “Yes, I think it is the worst government ever and does not deserve to be re-elected whatsoever, but I will do everything in my power to keep its members of Parliament elected.” It literally makes no sense to anyone, yet it is a “wash, rinse and repeat” tactic for the NDP.</ParaText>

To some extent, I can sort of see the situation from the NDP's perspective after many years of blindly supporting the Liberal government no matter what. Many people now view the NDP and the Liberals as largely one and the same. When I knock on the doors of many seniors in my riding who were long-time NDP supporters, they tell me that voting NDP used to mean something and that the NDP has lost its way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564256">I will now go back to the Bloc. The Bloc's suddenly standing with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is something I did not fully expect. After all, the Liberal government has failed to deliver for the people of Quebec just as badly as it has for the citizens of every other province and territory. The Liberal government has literally turned failure into an art form on immigration, foreign interference in our democratic process, softwood lumber and the now $60-million so-called gun buyback program that has not bought a single firearm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564257"> Crime is up massively. There is corruption in the federal program for contracting, complete fiscal mismanagement, and failure with our military and in our foreign policy. Everywhere we look, there is so much failure. That is not good for our provinces and territories. It is not good for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564258">Worse yet, the Bloc is now supporting a Liberal-NDP coalition that has doubled housing costs, taxed food, punished work and unleashed crime. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="278793" Type="7">House leader for the Bloc</Affiliation> has said that there has been “excessive centralization” never before seen in history, and that a government that has difficultly managing it owns missions was starting to get its hands “into the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564259">There is one quick note I would like to share with the Bloc members in this place. There is a small value-added business in my riding whose owner sources his raw goods from two places. One of those places happens to be Quebec. Every time the carbon tax increases, the shipping bill from the trucking company he uses to get the raw supply from Quebec becomes more expensive. The trucking company literally sent out a note making it clear that it is increasing its shipping rates because of the carbon tax. After the next carbon tax increase, it will be more cost-effective to get those raw goods from outside of Canada. What a shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564260">The jurisdictions that do not have carbon taxes and the trucking costs from the border of the B.C. interior are much cheaper than Quebec. The business owner says the carbon tax makes him feel punished for trying to use Quebec-sourced goods or, for that matter, goods from any other Canadian province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564261">Does the Bloc think that is good for Canada? Why does the Bloc want to become the new NDP and stand with the Liberal government? It is so bizarre. Every Bloc member of this place will have to answer to their own constituents as to why the Bloc is now working for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> instead of working for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564262">Before I close, I have to come back to something the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> said recently: “it is the people's time.” I could not agree with him more on this. Why not give the people an election so they can be heard, because we work for the people? I do not know about the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberals, but I work for the people who sent me here. I do not work for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564263">Every time they vote against a confidence motion, they are voting against the people and against giving them a say on the Liberal government. It is well past time to give the people their say and have a carbon tax election. It is the people's time. I for one dare the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> to stand for a change, using his own words, instead of standing for the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564264">Canadians want a government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Canada's common-sense Conservatives are ready to do that for them. We believe government should serve the people, not the other way around. Therefore I ask my friends in this place to start putting the pressure on the government and to vote in support of the motion. I do hope that the voices of Canadians will be heard, not just through my words but also through our collective voice as a Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564280">Madam Speaker, it is a little awkward that we are here again today, just a few hours after the House voted non-confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party of Canada, but here we are. It is a little awkward because there is only one party in the House that does not want to work for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564281">Yesterday, after that vote of non-confidence in the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, the Conservatives moved to obstruct debate so that we could not get to a second confidence motion on the ways and means motion. I guess they would be embarrassed to have lost two of those votes in one day. It is the only reason that I can surmise for moving to obstruct the business of the House. Then again, we know that those in the Conservative Party of Canada, its leader and its members, are only here for their own personal political gain. Its members are not here because they actually want to work on behalf of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564282">Yesterday, we saw that there are three parties in the House that want to work for Canadians. They are the Liberal members of Parliament, the Bloc members of Parliament and the New Democratic members of Parliament, and they are all here to get work done for Canadians. That is unsurprising to me as we have seen, particularly since this <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has become the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, that he treats our democratic institutions as a joke. He does not take them seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564283">What I have found interesting is that today, even though they are moving again for non-confidence in the government, there is not the pomp and ceremony. In fact, it feels a little deflated in here. It feels like those Conservative members of Parliament do not have that same energy because they lost that motion yesterday and they are doing it again today. It feels kind of sad and desperate. That is what it feels like to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564284">Let us look at the Conservatives' record. When we listened to the speech from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> on Tuesday, when he moved that first motion, he asked that we look at his record. He asked that we judge him on his record. There is really only one thing of note that he has ever done when he was in government, and it was not a positive thing. He, when he was minister of democratic institutions, brought forward what was considered to be one of the worst bills when it comes to electoral changes in Canadian history. It was widely panned by experts. It was widely panned by anybody who cares about rights and democracy. The only thing that he was able to accomplish was to make it harder for 500,000 Canadians to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564285">If we want to look at his record, we can see that the only thing he was able to achieve was to limit and decrease the rights of Canadians. He talks about making Canada the freest country in the world, but the only thing he has ever done is to take people's freedoms away. That is not something that Canadians want in a Prime Minister, and it is certainly not something that they want in the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. We think about his record as he talks about housing, and it is really cute to hear them talk about housing because of his record as the minister of housing. I can actually count on two hands how many houses he built: one, two, three, four, five, six. There are six in total. That is the record he is putting forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564286">Let us take him at his word and look at what his record is for Canadians. The other thing that he did, and he did not do this as a private member, is that he was the architect behind the Conservative plan, when they were in government, to put anti-union, anti-worker, anti-women and anti-abortion private members' bills in place. This is a typical Conservative tactic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564287">Yesterday in the House, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> said that he would not reopen the abortion debate, but then he kind of did a wink, wink and nudge, nudge because that is exactly what Mr. Harper did when he was Prime Minister. He had his members bring those forward as private members' bills, through the back door, so he could pretend that it was not the government that was doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564288">We see that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> speaks on one side to say that, no, he is not going to do this, but then he looks at the members of his party who are social conservatives and tells them not to worry, that they can go, all-expenses-paid, down to Florida to anti-abortion conferences to talk about how they are going to bring those American-style politics up to Canada, to limit a woman's right to choose and to limit their ability to access reproductive health care in this country. He says that he will tell everybody that he is not going to do it, but to not worry because they can do it through the back door.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8564289"> This is the issue that we have when it comes to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>: He refuses to tell Canadians the whole truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564290">Let me get back to housing because the member who was just speaking talked about the Conservatives' great housing plan. They talk about their great housing plan, but they are not going to provide any funding to municipalities until they build the houses. For anyone who knows how municipalities work, or how development and planning work, are they just going to have a whole bunch of empty houses with no roads to get there, no sewers to use and no electricity? Those development charges, the funding that funds all of the stuff that builds healthy neighbourhoods, are required to get those houses built. The vision that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> of Canada is putting forward is a whole bunch of empty homes with nobody able to get there or use them because there will not be any of the necessary services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564291">He talks about cutting taxes, but taxes pay for the services and programs that we care about as Canadians. They pay for the health care we receive, the education our children receive and the child care our children go to. They pay for the roads, the public infrastructure and everything that makes this country great and gives Canadians a fair shot at success. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564292">Over the past nine years, our government has ensured that people have a fair shot at success and that the Canadian dream is an equal playing field, so that income, family background or where people come from do not matter. All people have an opportunity to succeed because Liberals believe that is the Canadian dream. When we have a <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> who only talks about tearing down the institutions that we have in Canada, the very institutions that have made this country great, that is not leadership. That is not someone who believes in this country or who wants to build a prosperous, successful and equitable Canada where everybody has a chance at success. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564293">Our government is very proud of the record it has had over the last nine years. The Canada child benefit lifted 650,000 children out of poverty. Let us compare that to what the Conservatives did. They had the UCCB, which sent $100 a month to all parents, but it was all taxable. The Canada child benefit is tax-free. That is money in people's pockets that helps with the high costs of groceries, rent and raising a family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564294">When it comes to senior citizens, what is the record of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>? He was in a Conservative government that raised the age of retirement from 65 to 67. He was in a government that cut seniors' pensions. What have the Liberals done? The first thing we did was increase the guaranteed income supplement by 10%. We increased old age security for those 75 and over by 10%. We also increased the Canada pension plan for future seniors to make sure that everybody would have a dignified retirement in Canada. Our record speaks for itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564295">Let us talk about workers' rights. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is going around talking to workers saying that he supports them. He has one of the most anti-worker, anti-union records in Canadian history. He has done everything possible to try to bust unions, limit workers' rights and make sure they do not have the strength they need to continue to support labour rights in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564296">One of the first things we did when we came into office was to reverse those anti-labour laws that Stephen Harper and the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, who was the minister of employment at the time, put forward. His record speaks for itself. He is anti-union and anti-labour. He simply does not care about workers' rights. What Canadians see, when they hear him speaking, is that he only tells half the truth. He neglects the part of the story that does not fit the narrative he wants to put forward, and he is hiding his true agenda. He can tell workers he supports them, but let us look at the facts. Let us look at what he has actually delivered for Canadians workers, and it is anything but pro-union and anything but pro-worker.</ParaText>

If we want to have a country where our children can prosper and grow, and where our grandchildren can prosper, we have to fight climate change. That means we have to have a comprehensive plan when it comes to the price on pollution, the work to do with industry partners and investments in clean technology. We have to have that whole picture because this is a whole-of-society fight that we need to engage in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564298">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> says that he will do things for climate change, but right now, all he has is imaginary ideas that nobody has ever tested. The fact of the matter is that, when he was in government, when Stephen Harper was Prime Minster, we had the worst climate record in the world. Canadians were ashamed of our actions on climate change when the Leader of the Opposition was in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564299">We just received news that our climate plan is working. The equivalent of 60 million cars has been taken off the road in climate-emission reductions because of the work we have put forward. Now, let us talk about our international record. Last fall, I thought the House was going to unanimously pass the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement. I thought that would be something that would go smoothly. Instead, we saw obstruction at every single turn, which was led by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564300">Canada has stood strong with Ukraine against Russia's illegal occupation and war. Again, we saw obstruction at every moment from the Conservatives. This was apparently because there was something about a price on pollution in the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement, which was an absolute red herring since Ukraine already had a price on pollution. This was simply an update. It was a wink and a nod to the people online who are supporting the Russian occupation. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> did not want to necessarily rock that boat because he is one of those people who goes down those conspiracy theory rabbit holes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564301">He was absolutely against moving forward in support for Ukraine. Finally, he was shamed into doing so, but it took a very long time. It is shameful that he was trying to obstruct and obscure our standing alongside our allies. If we think about it, the very fact that he cannot even get allies in the House to support his little political games makes me wonder how in the world he is going to get allies around the world to support Canada's objectives moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564302">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> takes this place for a joke. He takes Canadians for a joke. Canadians deserve more than that. They deserve more from their political leaders than to be treated as props and to be treated as symbols for political advancement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564303">On this side of the House, and indeed among the other political parties, the NDP, the Bloc Québécois and the Liberals, we are here to work for Canadians. We will continue to do that. We will continue to advance the important work of the House. The only question we have today is whether the Conservatives will stop playing their silly partisan games, get over these ideas of grandeur and, instead, actually work for Canadians. All we see today is the fact that the Conservatives are only here to work for themselves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564340">Getting back to the motion before the House, I would like to start by saying that our Conservative colleagues are not being serious. They are mocking us today. I say that because, two days ago, they moved a non-confidence motion that said the House does not have confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is all it said. Our response was that we found it interesting that they thought that. Let me reassure them. We do not trust anyone. We do not have confidence in the current government and we do not have confidence in any Conservative government. My job is to protect the interests of Quebec until we are independent. That is our job. We are trying to make progress every day. We will continue to do so, despite the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s ambitions and his propensity for stamping his feet. He really wants to be emperor, replacing the current emperor. We told them that it was not enough. We will vote on motions with some substance. Two days later, with more theatrics, they come up with the idea of including their slogan in the motion, thinking that we would definitely vote with them. How can anyone take them seriously?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564341">I find it quite sad. I am not making personal attacks, I am talking about the content. As members know, I focus on content, and I want things to move forward. We tell them that it is not good enough and that we are going to vote for things that are important to Quebec. They come back with a motion saying it is time to “axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime”, which they repeat to us <I>ad nauseam</I>, approximately 72 times a day, without ever explaining it. That is what I find interesting. I want to hear them explain what they are going to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564342">They tell us in the motion that food has been taxed. I just spoke on Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C‑234</Document>, which deals with the carbon tax we keep hearing about. As we in the Bloc Québécois are reasonable people, we agreed to create an exemption for grain drying. The bill already went to the Senate and has come back to the House. All that remains is to vote on it. The first speech I made in the House last January dealt with this, but since then, people claiming to want to make life easier for farmers have been blocking the legislation. They are adding speakers to fill the time and they are not allowing us to vote on the bill. Once we vote on it, it will be settled, provided we accept the Senate amendments, of course. That is the reasonable, intelligent and rational choice that the Bloc team has made, because that is how we operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564343">The Conservatives keep yelling at me that the government is taxing food, but I would like them to show me that they do not plan to do the same. Results do not matter to them. What they want is an election. They are scheming for power. Nothing else matters. All they want is to score political points, spout slogans, generate sound bites and rake in money. They are not working for the people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564344">They talk to us about housing. Many times I have heard government representatives say that the Leader of the Opposition, while serving as housing minister, created something like six affordable housing units. I must confess, I did not check this figure. We hear it often. There must be some truth to it, although we should exercise caution. Everything said in the House is not necessarily true. We have to be careful. There is no proof. We will be careful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564345">People talk to us about interference and a centralist government, but the opposition leader is directly threatening cities with funding cuts if he does not like the look of the mayor. That is quite something. We are hearing that if a mayor is incompetent, their funding will be cut. First of all, he has no right to do that in Quebec. That has to go through Quebec. There is more to it than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564346">They might be angry because they received only 12% of the vote in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun. They are hot and bothered about getting a more positive vote, maybe. Even yesterday, members began saying that the Bloc Québécois was no longer party of the regions because we captured a Montreal riding. That is interesting.

              <ParaText id="8564349">We are here to make gains for Quebec. We have two conditions. We want our seniors to have a decent standard of living. There has been enough dilly-dallying. Seniors aged 65 to 74 need money just as much as seniors aged 75 and up. Let us not create new discrimination. Let us let them make a little more money before taxing them on that income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564350">The other big thing is the protection of supply management in future trade negotiations. That one is the easiest condition to meet because our bill is already before the Senate, which started working on it yesterday evening. We are very pleased about that, even though we have learned some rather troubling things. I want to point out that the bill is getting a lot of support from senators, but there is also some opposition. I think that we we need to go talk to those people. We really need to put a rush on this. We need to move forward faster. The House passed this bill in June 2023 and now it is September 2024. I would have expected the Senate to examine this bill in September or October of 2023, but it seems as though it was set aside. It is a private member's bill, which means that it less of a priority than government bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564351">It is no ordinary private member's bill, however. It obtained official approval from the executive branch of the government via the minister of agriculture and agri-food at the time. It is a serious bill, and the government supports it. If it really supports it, it should support it in the Senate as well, yet that is not what we have seen until very recently. It is good that the subject was raised in the Senate yesterday. The committee chair wanted to reassure us by saying that they had other fish to fry, but now that they had started working on it, it would not take long. We want to believe them, and we are watching. The senators are aware of our deadline here, that is, the end of October. The bill needs to be studied. I do not expect every senator to vote in favour of it, but I expect the bill to be studied on the Senate floor. We are certain we can win the vote, because we got an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons with 262 votes for and 51 votes against. Even a majority of Conservatives voted in favour of the bill, despite all the obstruction. I want to point out that the bill is getting similar support in the Senate. I have people on my side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564352">Things need to move forward. Why do we need to move forward? Because it is not certain whether we will get another chance to protect supply management in the near future, and because more international negotiations are coming. Yesterday we heard several times that there will be a review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA. Before reviewing CUSMA, can we clarify our mandates? There is a way of clarifying mandates. In terms of supply management, they did their part. It is almost 10% in every sector. It is even worse for milk at 18%. As someone I know well would say, that is enough, anything more will be untenable. That is what is happening, because people need to understand that supply management is a balancing act. Prices are controlled, market supply is controlled. To be able to do that, we need to control what is coming in from outside. With milk at 18%, that means one quart of milk out of every five will be coming from outside. It has not happened yet, but we are getting there gradually. It will be difficult to maintain a balance. More than that and it collapses. It will not work any more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564353">If people have no intention of protecting supply management, then they should be honest with the farmers and say so. They should uphold the value of the incredible system they put in place, that preserves family businesses, that preserves the vitality in each of our regions, that allows businesses to run, from the Gaspé to Abitibi and to Montérégie with the same transportation costs. The supply management system is so good, so effective. It provides a very stable ecosystem for all other agricultural production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564354">I could go on all day, as I am sure you know. Unfortunately, I have only a few seconds left. I have 15 seconds left to tell you that this needs to get moving. My message to my Conservative friends today, whose questions I am looking forward to answering, is let us be serious. Let us be serious and work on the issues. There is going to be an election, do not worry. Our decision not to trigger an election today is not made out of fear.</ParaText>

As a former member of the Quebec government that joined the carbon exchange with California, what are her thoughts on the fact that she is now a member of a political party that wants to abolish pollution pricing in the rest of Canada?

              <ParaText id="8564376">Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to follow my colleague from Berthier—Maskinongé, whom I greatly appreciate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564377">I would like to begin with a bit of background about when Parliament resumed. I will outline what has happened since we returned to the House. Hearing our explanation may help people better understand our reasons for voting for or against the motions moved by the Conservatives. My basic premise is that some people need to have things explained to them for a long time before they understand. I will explain things for as long as it takes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564378">This fall, at our caucus meetings before Parliament resumed, this was the approach we were taking. We were thinking that, for the first time in about two and a half years, the Bloc Québécois had the opportunity to capitalize on what should have been the norm for the past two and a half years, namely a true minority government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564379">The people decided that this would be a minority government. However, what we have seen is that it has acted like a majority government with the NDP's help, which means that the government in power did not reflect the will of the people for two and a half years. Today, after the surprise termination of the agreement at the end of the summer, things are back to normal, that is, we have a minority government that is obliged to negotiate with the other parties. The Bloc Québécois now holds the balance of power that had slipped through its fingers in recent years. However, that did not prevent us from making headway. The opposition parties play an important role in both minority and majority governments. We proved that with the bills we pushed through despite everything and which I will address a bit later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564380">We saw that we had the balance of power and that we had an opportunity we have not had in a while. We were not going to discard it the first chance we got. We decided to take the opportunity to get more for Quebec. In some cases, these gains will also benefit all Canadians, and I say good for them. The Bloc Québécois is not that chauvinistic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564381">That is why, yesterday, we set out specific goals we wish to achieve, explicit gains we want to make before a set deadline. Unlike the NDP, who tied its own hands for two and a half years, we do not intend to blindly support the government until fall 2025. We do not intend to remain uselessly patient and allow the government to refuse to make a decision for absolutely nothing when it comes to our demands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564382">Our two main demands concern seniors and supply management. Our deadline for achieving our demands is the end of October, which is reasonable in both cases. It is reasonable in terms of content. The two bills in question are Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>, which was introduced by my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, and Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document>, which was introduced by my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="278281" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation> and other members, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="278373" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, who preceded me. These two bills have already made their way through the House. At worst they are the subject of a relative consensus and, in some cases, they received a large majority of votes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564383">Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document>, progressed so well that it made it to the Senate. We are therefore asking the government to perhaps make it easier, to ensure that there are no useless obstructions so that this bill can get to an irreversible point, as our leader mentioned. We want it to reach the point of no return by obtaining royal assent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564384">The same is true of the bill for seniors. The bill passed second reading. It was sent back to committee. The committee produced a report that received the unanimous support of the parties. There should not be any problem. This is an absolutely essential matter we are working on. This unanimity did not come out of thin air. It represents more purchasing power for seniors, regardless of their age, starting at age 65. It is the opposite of what the government was trying to do when it created two classes of seniors, when it created a difference between seniors age 65 to 74 and seniors age 75 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564385">Yesterday on <I>Téléjournal</I> we saw some statistics concerning seniors' needs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8564386">It was reported that 59% of seniors aged 75 and over earn less than $30,000 a year, which is not much. In the case of seniors aged 65 to 74, that proportion is 54%. Despite all that, until recently, the government was telling us that seniors aged 65 to 74 do not need as much money as seniors who are 75 and over and that this older group really needs help. As if the cost of living were not the same for both groups. As if groceries cost less when you get to age 75. As if there were an additional discount. As if prescription drugs were less expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564387">The Bloc Québécois could not make any sense out of this and decided it was time to put an end to the discrimination. The argument that one age group has fewer needs than the other does not hold water. That is evident when we look at who is getting the GIS, and we should note that anyone receiving the GIS cannot be that well off: 39% of seniors aged 75 and over are entitled to the GIS, while 29% of seniors aged 65 to 74 qualify to receive it. Our motion will make it possible to enhance the old age pension, the OAS, which will benefit many seniors who need it, despite the arguments we have been hearing from the government that these people are not a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564388">Our measures are reasonable, and so is our deadline. We said October 29, which gives the government almost five weeks to get these bills, which are already at a late stage, passed. In the meantime, we do not intend to lose this opportunity to make gains. That means, and this is no surprise, that we will be voting against today's motion. I hope that the Conservatives understand why, if they are listening at all to what we are saying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564389">That is how we work. We take a logical approach. We work to make gains for our constituents. That is exactly what we are doing. If, like some people, we were only interested in ourselves, we might be satisfied with our victory in the riding of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun. We might be satisfied with the polls, which show we are in a pretty good position, and decide that, if we call an election right away, it will be good for the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564390">No, we chose to do what is good for Quebec, as we have always done and as we will continue to do. If, for example, we make gains and obtain results with Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document>, we will not let the government walk all over us by bartering support for interference, for example. We will not vote in favour of something that is bad for Quebec because we managed to achieve something good for Quebec. We will not change who we are in future votes. I hope that both the government and the Conservatives understand that. We are telling them our strategy for the future, in case they missed that. If it is good for Quebec, the Bloc Québécois votes for it. If it is bad for Quebec, the Bloc Québécois votes against it. That will never change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564391">When we are asked whether we have confidence in the government, the answer is that we do not trust the Liberals any more than we trust a potential Conservative government to look after Quebec's interests. It is a good thing that the Bloc Québécois is here, because the Conservatives and the Liberals are both the same. They both want to attack Bill 21, and neither have any lessons to give in terms of oil subsidies. When it comes to immigration, the war Quebec is waging may have begun with the Liberals, but we have no guarantees about what the Conservatives plan to about another one of Quebec's demands, namely, the distribution of asylum seekers, since this is at a standstill with Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. What do those provinces have in common? They all have Conservative premiers. These are the same people who are unable to respond to Quebec's needs and who are saying that Quebec needs to figure things out itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564392">When we are asked whether we have confidence, the answer is no. The only confidence we have is in ourselves and our ability to make gains. That is how we are going to operate moving forward. We are also not worried about an election. We are ready. If we need to campaign in the snow, then we will bundle up and do that. There is not much that scares the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>

I listened to the Liberals talk about how they had made a promise to fix OAS, but then when it came down to it, they skipped the 65 to 74 age category, which is super unfair. It does not cost seniors in that age category less.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564414">Here we are again in the House of Commons debating one of the Conservatives' ridiculous motions that they bring forward time and time again. There are Canadians who are struggling to put food on the table, who are struggling to pay their rent or buy their first home and who are struggling in our country. Imagine what it must feel like for them to see the gamesmanship, the ridiculousness and the baffling behaviour of the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564415">On Tuesday, we had a debate just like this, and every single member of this House, except the Conservative members, voted non-confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. We are doing it again. We will just keep doing it because the Conservatives seem to have no ideas, no suggestions, and no policies to bring forward to help Canadians. They want to have bumper stickers and slogans, and they want to waste our time in the House, when we really should be debating important legislation that could help Canadians right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564416">I also want to point out the Conservatives are deeply unserious and they are misleading Canadians. I do not say this lightly: They are a danger to our democracy. They will not speak with media. I do not know if everybody knows, but they will not speak to the CBC and now they will not speak to CTV. Clearly, they do not recognize that media plays an important role in any democracy. Media is allowed to ask questions of the opposition, questions that they clearly do not want to answer. They would rather have their YouTube videos and their 30-second slots where they do not actually have to answer any difficult questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564417">What is the Conservatives' actual policy? Do they believe in climate change? Are they homophobic? Are they anti-women? Will they take away women's rights to reproductive health? They do not want to answer those questions.</ParaText>

They do not understand that 58% of doctors in Alberta have said they are going to leave their practices because of the current provincial Conservative government. The cuts to health care are fundamental, and we cannot allow a Conservative government to take away those things that are vitally important for so many people. </ParaText>

The overwhelming message that Albertans are giving their elected leaders is that they do not want Danielle Smith messing around with their pensions. </ParaText>

They promised Canadians that they would fix that, and fixing it halfway is exactly why Canadians are tired of the Liberal government. It is one thing to say something; it is another thing to do it halfway. Frankly, these are some of my concerns.</ParaText>

They viciously attacked medical doctors and frontline nurses, to the point that doctors trying to keep people alive have faced death threats. That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable that MPs face death threats from the mob, whom I see Conservatives patting on the back every day. There are people threatening and attacking indigenous MPs, attacking women MPs and attacking racialized MPs, but to attack and threaten medical doctors is not what a leader does. Those are the tactics of the Leader of the Opposition, and he wonders why we do not have confidence in him running our country. </ParaText>

With the situation in Lebanon and Gaza, a humanitarian disaster is unfolding, yet the member for <Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Edmonton Manning</Affiliation> had nothing to say about the threats facing Lebanese Canadians and the Lebanese people. He had nothing to say about it because if those in the Conservative caucus do not repeat talking points, they do not get a gold star and they sit on the backbench. That is not leadership.

In Edmonton Manning, the Lebanese community is living in terror from the Israeli air assaults, and the member says nothing because he wants to get the gold star from his leader, who lives in the big mansion in Stornoway, by repeating and repeating the same dumbed-down slogans.

              <ParaText id="8564511">This shows the lack of seriousness about a horrific humanitarian disaster, the genocide happening in Gaza, with people dying, the targeting of medical doctors, the targeting of civilians and the targeting of journalists. This is something we in the House would deal with, but what we have learned from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is that he has no interest in standing on the international stage. He ridicules the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for staying at an expensive hotel. Well, he is the leader of a G7 country.

That is what we should doing in Canada, but decency is not part of this leader's mantra.</ParaText>

I have been 20 years in the House and have never seen so many members reduced to caricature rhyming schemes. It is like a toxic Dr. Seuss, and the Conservatives repeat them again and again: “I don't like green eggs and ham. I don't like them, Sam-I-am.

              <ParaText id="8564520"> I think it is really important to point out that with the foreign interference inquiry, documents have been tabled that say Erin O'Toole believes he was taken down as leader of the Conservative Party by foreign interference. That was in the documents. We know that many in the cabal over there supported the takedown of Erin O'Toole, and the one who benefited is the man now living in Stornoway.

The member said “that side of the House”. Therefore, I want to indicate that the hon. member will be able to speak.

              <ParaText id="8564554">Let us talk about the budget. The Liberals have increased the number of public servants by 40% since they took office. There are an extra 100,000 people on the government payroll. Do members recall what was happening last year at Service Canada offices? People who needed passports and other federal government services were lined up out the door and camping outside Service Canada offices. That is not even to mention immigration and the endless delays there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8564555">The debt has increased so much that it has actually doubled since the Liberals took office. Debt charges are now at an all-time high. They cost more than health transfers. They are equal to the amount Canadians pay in GST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564556">Inflation has reached a level beyond anything we have seen in the past 40 years. Everyone knows it. Everyone is aware. Everyone is experiencing it every day. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, a serious institution, Canada's economic growth is projected to be the worst of all member countries over the next three decades—not the next three years, but the next three decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564557">This Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has personally increased the debt more than all prime ministers on that side combined. Need I remind the House that, since 2015, nine years ago, the Liberal government has not balanced the budget even once? No father or mother, and certainly no single mother, would ever manage their household budget so irresponsibly. We are the trustees of the public purse. We are entrusted with public finances, taxpayers' money, to use it intelligently. Over the past few years, since 2015, the Liberal government has not balanced a single budget. It has run deficits every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564558">No one here thinks that there was no need for any effort to be made during COVID-19. That is not what we are talking about. Before COVID-19, our economy was flourishing, things were going well. The government said it would run small deficits, but that it would not matter. The Liberals made a lot of promises that they never kept, especially when it came to housing. The Liberals promised us housing. Does anyone how many homes will have to be built between now and 2030 to meet all of Canada's housing needs? A whopping 8.5 million. The cost of housing has doubled, rents have doubled, mortgages have doubled. There is not one young person left who can afford to buy a house. Young people can barely afford a two-bedroom apartment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564559">I will remind members of what the leader of the Bloc Québécois said recently about the federal Liberal Party. He said, “The government has two choices then. It can hold off on its aggressive centralization agenda, its abuse of the fiscal imbalance and abuse of spending power until the end of its mandate, which would normally run until late 2025, or it can call an election now to try to obtain that type of mandate, which I strongly doubt that Quebec will consider.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564560">That was on May 23, 2024. The leader of the Bloc Québécois rose in the House to speak on behalf of his party. Today, the Bloc leader is so filled with hubris he reminds us of Louis XIV, who used to say, “I am the state”. He is telling us that things will no longer work like before and that the Bloc Québécois will not support the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564561">I do not have enough time to thoroughly demonstrate this government's negligence, as I wanted to do. The Premier of Quebec, who is the head of the Quebec government and who represents all Quebeckers, says that he no longer has confidence in the government. Everyone knows that this is the most centralizing government ever. The Bloc Québécois voted against our motion last Tuesday. Then they unabashedly say that they will not vote for our motion next week. What country are they living in? They are living in Canada, where children are hurting and where people cannot find housing. It is high time that we got a new government.</ParaText>

Two were actually on the heels of Paul Martin's surplus, and the other one, the one they called balanced in 2015, was done on the backs of veterans and selling shares of GM at bargain prices.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564579"> Mr. Speaker, it is always a tough act to follow after a great intervention from my colleague from Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564580">As a proud son of immigrants, I have seen that struggle at home personally. My parents chose Canada about 40 years ago. They came to this country a blue-collar, working-class family with not much in their pockets. My dad worked at the same factory for about 30 years. Growing up, I did not get a chance to see him at home. He would leave at two in the morning and he would come back at 8 p.m.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564581">As a young father myself, I understand now how hard that sacrifice is. He made that sacrifice for me, for that next generation, because Canada had a promise that if people worked hard and played by the rules, they could achieve that Canadian dream, that dream of home ownership, of buying a decent home in a safe neighbourhood, of going on a vacation once in a while.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564582">That sacrifice my dad made, Canadians are making that every day. They are working harder and harder in the hope that the next generation will do better than the previous. Sadly, after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government, we are starting to see that hope slip away. That Canadian dream, that Canadian promise that so many have fought hard for, is starting to leave our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564583">We have the worst economic crisis in my lifetime, in the last 40 years. Two million Canadians are lining up at food banks and 1,400 tent cities are popping up across our province alone, 25 in Oxford county. That was never the case. That never happened before. Two million food bank visits in a single month is not the Canadian dream my parents came to. That is not the Canadian dream Canadians want to live today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564584">The Liberal policies are making it worse. The Liberals brought in the carbon tax, a carbon tax that punishes our farmers who are feeding our families. They are punishing our truckers who ship our food and product in our country. It is going to cost our farmers a billion dollars. It is going to cost our truckers $4 billion. It is going to be a blow of over $30 billion to our GDP and our economy. It is simple. When we tax the farmer who grows the food and we tax the trucker who ships the food, we punish all Canadians who buy the food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564585">Now the Liberals have this new capital gains tax hike. They are taxing our farmers; we have a food crisis. They are taxing our doctors; we have a doctor shortage crisis. They are taxing our home builders; we have a national home building crisis. Just yesterday, Jack Mintz put an article out projecting that the Liberal capital gains tax hike would take away 414,000 jobs from our Canadian economy and blow $90 billion from our GDP. That is devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564586">These tax policies are hurting our housing policies. Housing costs have doubled. Mortgage payments have doubled. Rent has doubled. The amount needed for a down payment has doubled. More and more young Canadians, that next generation I spoke about, are now being forced not to buy homes. They are staying with their parents in their basements. That dream of home ownership is starting to fade away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564587">In 2022, we built fewer homes than we did in 1972, and we had half the population. The Liberals' plan is not working. Even if we manage to buy a home or rent a home, look at the neighbourhoods and what is happening in our streets. There is crime, chaos, drugs and disorder right across our communities. After nine years of the Liberal-NDP government, we are seeing a 50% increase in violent crime. Extortions are up. Auto theft is up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564588">A few weeks ago in Woodstock, a safe family neighbourhood with a lot of parks and children, there was a drive-by shooting at a home. We have never seen that before. We have seen 47,000 Canadians die from opiate drug overdoses since the Liberals took power of our country.</ParaText>

Instead of investing in treatment and bringing our loved ones home drug-free, they are supporting radical drug policies, like giving government-funded meth, crack and other drugs out in vending machines to the public.

              <ParaText id="8564596">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals' catch-and-release policies, like Bill <Document DbId="13180632" Type="3">C-75</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, have released criminals back on to the streets. It is a revolving door that they created. My constituents tell me every single day that because of the violent crime, they are not safe in their communities anymore. They are afraid to walk on their streets and go to the park with their families. That is not the Canadian dream that my parents came here for. The sad thing is that the NDP, and the Bloc now, continue to prop up the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564597">In my riding, we have a great auto plant, GM's CAMI, and great union workers work there. I met one of the workers last week. He said he has voted for the NDP his whole life. He thought the NDP was the party for workers, but he said it is not anymore. He will be voting Conservative for the first time because he knows the NDP sold out Canadians when it voted 24 times for the carbon tax. The NDP is killing the jobs of our workers and has sold out our workers. Our common-sense Conservative team will always stand with workers and ensure that we put more food on the table for their families so they can live that Canadian dream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564598">Canadians are now losing hope. We hear it, we see it and we feel it. The stories we share today are stories of many Canadians. They are stories of our friends, our neighbours, seniors and single mothers. They are everyday Canadians trying to survive, to make the sacrifice, like my dad did, to get ahead in this country, to build a better life for the next generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564599">The Liberals have tried extremely hard to divide Canadians. They are pitting one region against the other. They are trying to divide our communities by spreading misinformation and disinformation. I know that Canadians see through this. There is hope in our country. We know Canadians are resilient. Our country is strong. I believe in our country and the Conservatives believe in our country. We know that, with the right leadership, we can get our country back on track and restore that Canadian promise that my father came to this country for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564600">That is why the Conservatives are calling for a carbon tax election now. There is a very clear choice between the NDP-Liberal costly carbon tax coalition that will tax our food, punish our work and take our money, or a common-sense Conservative plan, led by our great <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, that will axe the tax so Canadians can heat, eat and house themselves. We would build homes so Canadians can have a roof over their head. We would fix the budget so we can drive down inflation. We would stop the crime so our families can live in safe neighbourhoods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564601">We would be a government that would stand with the farmers who feed our families. We would be a government that would stand with lawful gun owners and go after real criminals who destroy our communities. We would be a government that would put Canadians first. We would be a government that believes in the prosperity of Canada, that believes better is possible and believes in Canada. For nine years, we have not seen that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564602">However, Canadians will have a choice and I call on all parties to call an election. What are they afraid of? Let Canadians decide; that is democracy. Every single day, we will do our job and hold the government accountable, unlike the other parties that have sold out their constituents. We will fight for Canadians every single day.</ParaText>

Their priorities of trying to get clean water, good jobs and social safety nets to help every single person have been difficult for indigenous people.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8564622"> Mr. Speaker, it is great to rise this afternoon in this most honourable House and see many of my colleagues here today fighting and debating for their constituents. Earlier this week, I had the chance to rise and speak about a similar type of motion presented by the official opposition party. Let me simply start by saying this. Canada is the best country in the world, in my humble opinion. I am so delighted to be raising three daughters in Vaughan and to be fighting for them day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564623">I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston in the Islands</Affiliation>, my dear colleague and friend. The hon. member mentioned earlier that his mother came from Italy some 50-odd years ago. My father here came via Australia first, and my mother directly through Pier 21. It was a fascinating story. She took the train from Halifax all the way to Prince Rupert, from one end of the country to another, and brought us to a promised land. Canada chose us. Canada chose my parents, and I am so happy that Canada did and gave us this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564624">Canada is the best country in the world, not by accident. Yes, it is a work in progress, but Canada is the best country in the world because we do what is right. We take care of the most vulnerable citizens. We allow those who wish to create wealth and generate jobs to do so. We are blessed with bountiful natural resources and human capital. Peace, order and good government is our mantra. We have delivered for Canadians. I think of the Canada child benefit, a monthly tax-free benefit that goes to 15,000 families in my riding. I think of the Canada dental care plan, and how 7,200 residents, the majority of whom are seniors, are now receiving affordable and accessible dental care thanks to the Canadian dental care plan in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564625">I think of the early learning and national day care plan, something that all economists, right, left, centre, say is a great thing for female participation in the labour force and for affordability. It is a win for the economy, for families and for affordability. It is reducing costs. An average family in Ontario right now is seeing almost a 53% reduction in their child care costs and is saving nearly $10,000 in after-tax savings. That is real money in the pockets of my residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564626">We put in place the Canada workers benefit that is helping lift literally hundreds of thousands of working Canadians out of poverty so that they can pay rent and afford groceries. We are helping Canadians. Canadians, including those in my riding, have gone through a lot. We went through COVID, a global pandemic. Our government was there with the CERB, the wage subsidy and rent subsidy. We helped businesses. We helped Canadians, because it is the Canadian thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564627">I know my hon. colleague on the opposite side mentioned earlier that when we first came into power, we had to remove two of the most anti-union, anti-worker bills, Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document>. We removed those bills because we support Canadian workers. We have never been a chameleon when it comes to that. We have always stood beside Canadian workers of all stripes, in all industries and in all careers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564628">On seniors, we were the government that returned the age of retirement for eligibility for old age security and the guaranteed income supplement to 65 from 67. If that had been fully implemented, that would have cost retirees, at about $780 a month, times 12, by two years, over $15,000. Someone went off to Davos, Switzerland, and announced that they were going to be changing the retirement system, arbitrarily, with no consultation and no studies, and said that this was going to be right for Canadians. They themselves benefit from a very generous pension system, much like the official opposition <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> does, who, by age 31 or 32, from what I have read, receives a beautiful pension and benefits. It is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564629">We think about our economy, the investments our government has made in partnering with electric vehicle manufacturers, including Honda, Stellantis and Volkswagen. Those are real investments creating real jobs in Ontario and across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564630">I think about the partnership with the steel industry, having the steel industry workers' backs, the aluminum workers in Quebec, in Kitimat, in Trail. We have their backs and we have always had their backs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564631"> We are not johnny-come-latelies to a party, like some of my hon. colleagues. I think of the investments in artificial intelligence and the things that are happening. Our support for Ukraine is undeniable. One does not flinch and one does not stop when dealing with a dictator, and we are dealing with one. One does not say they do not like the price on carbon so they are not going to vote for a free trade agreement with Ukraine. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564632">Let us talk some matters. We had to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and also to the European green deal. We responded with a number of tax credits and investment tax credits that have been put in place to help grow our economy and keep us competitive. That is what real leadership is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564633">We all know that Canadians love their homes. Homes are not just people's greatest investments but are also places where we create memories with our family. I have three daughters, aged 13, 11 and three; and a beautiful wife who supports me in this endeavour. A person's home is their home, and we know that Canadians love to purchase a home. It is maybe not for everyone, but most Canadians want to be homeowners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564634">Changes have been taking place in the mortgage market. The mortgage industry has applauded the change by the OSFI, the removal of the stress test on non-insured mortgages. There was an announcement last week by the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> regarding a homebuyers' bill of rights and a renters' bill of rights. The mortgage cap is going from $1 million to $1.5 million. There is also 30-year amortization, which is in line with the OECD countries for first-time homebuyers. There are new builds: green builds and all other new builds. These are real changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564635"> I was happy to announce in the city of Vaughan $59 million through the fund we established to accelerate building, and it has been put to use. I have already made an announcement with the mayor of Vaughan. It is happening; houses are being built.</ParaText>

The city of Vaughan has 350,000 residents, and 20,000 SMEs operate in our city. We are blessed with an entrepreneurial and generous spirit second to none in any of the ridings. We did lower the tax rate from 11% to 9%. We also increased the investable capital, where one qualifies for the small business tax rate. This is generating hundreds of millions of dollars of tax savings. It was in budget 2022 if I remember correctly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564643">On October 19, we will celebrate and mark again the lowering of credit card fees for small businesses. The first time we did, it meant a billion dollars in savings for small businesses. We are helping small businesses grow. We had the backs of small businesses during the pandemic. We were there for them. They went through a tough time. I know that the restaurants in my riding went through a tough time, as well as the small businesses, when they were shut down by the provincial government and with the imposition of measures, but we were there for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564644">In my concluding remarks, I go back to my comments at the beginning of my speech. We live in a blessed country. We are all of different faiths in this place, and we all attend church. I have my favourite psalms, psalms 91, 35 and 36, which I say to myself on a daily basis. We live in a beautiful country and a blessed country. My kids are growing up and I see their interactions with their friends, and there is an optimism, I think. We have gone through a lot with COVID, a global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, supply shocks and global inflation we had not seen in decades. However, our future is bright, and no one can take that away.</ParaText>

We know that Biden used them in his first year and they created hundreds of thousands of jobs. There were billions of dollars of investment. There is a complete clean-energy revolution taking place in California, Texas and across the United States, yet the investment tax credits that were promised two years ago by the Liberal government are nowhere to be seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564661">Europe is taking off, and others in the G7 are taking off, yet the government is still talking about investment tax credits when they are nowhere to be seen. The government literally moved mountains to get $34 billion into the hands of Suncor and Imperial for the TMX pipeline, yet clean-energy tax credits are still nowhere to be seen. Why have the Liberals failed on this simple task? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564665"> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today to speak to the motion. I did not have the opportunity to speak on Tuesday to a very similar motion, and I am really glad to be able to do it today because I think that a lot of my comments will be the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564666"> My speech today will definitely focus on the issue through which the Conservatives are requesting no confidence in the government. Then I would also like to talk a little bit about the NDP and where I see some hypocrisy, unfortunately, that has been coming out of our former colleagues in a supply and confidence agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564667"> Conservatives have set up a narrative, and we have heard it many times today already, based on the price on pollution and trying to blame everything on that. I know why they did it. It is easy to do it, and, quite honestly, they have been effective at doing it. They are trying to sell Canadians on the idea that the reason we have higher inflation and have cost of living issues is that they are a direct result of the carbon tax. That has been their objective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564668">However, I will just point out very quickly that inflation is back where it should be, at 2%, yet we still have the price on pollution, the carbon tax. Therefore the whole narrative has lost a lot of steam, particularly in the last few weeks and months since inflation numbers have been coming down. That does not stop the continual narrative. We heard it again this morning from Conservative members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564669"> The reality is that more people get back more than they pay. This is the way the system is set up. For people in a backstop province, all the money is collected and then equally distributed back to households based on household size. Eight out of 10 households in backstop jurisdictions get back more than they pay. That is a given fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564670">What is even more important is that 94% of households that have an income of less than $50,000 a year, which for a whole household is not a lot, get back more than they pay. Again, this is just a fact. When Conservatives try to argue to axe the tax because then suddenly people are going to be instantly better off, it is just not true. A majority of people are better off with the Canada carbon rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564671">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564672">
                <B> Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know I am touching on the truth and hitting a nerve when Conservatives heckle me on this point, because they always do that. However, it is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564673"> I have said to the House before, and I will say it again to those who might be listening at home and to those who are in the House, that I did the math myself for my own family. I looked at our Enbridge gas bill, which is the only thing we pay a carbon tax on. I added up all the carbon taxes for 2023. My wife and I drive electric hybrid vehicles, but I asked what the average Canadian uses in gas per year. I assumed we were using gas, as I did not want to throw off the equation by not having to pay the carbon tax on electricity that we are powering our cars with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564674">When I did that, I came to the conclusion that in 2023, I paid about $805 or $810, if I remember my calculations correctly, on the carbon tax. My rebate, not what the government told me I was going to get but what I saw when I actually looked at my bank statement, the four deposits in 2023, added up to about $865. Right off the bat I knew that my household was better off. We got back more than we paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564675"> A lot of people will ask how that is possible. How can the majority get back more than they pay? It is because the two out of 10 households, which might have many more vehicles, boats or other luxury items, are definitely going to be paying more than they get back. That is who the Conservatives are protecting. That is who they are really looking out for. They are looking out for the two out of 10 Canadians who are getting back more. The Conservatives will sell it as though who they are really looking out for are the lowest-income Canadians, but that is simply not the truth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564676"> I really started to feel a sense of disbelief, but not when the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> decided that he wanted to get out of the supply and confidence agreement, because I think that we all knew that would happen at one time or another, although I thought it was premature. I thought we still had a good year left to solidify a lot of these social programs that we had to make sure that they were there for a long time. What really bothered me was when, a few days later, he started to backtrack on the price on pollution, the carbon tax, basically saying that it was hurting Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564677">What it showed me in that moment, and what I think it showed a lot of Canadians, is that the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> does not have the ability to stand up to the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. He did a great job standing up to a protester outside of these doors just last week. I just wish he could stand up to the Leader of the Opposition like that. I know that the leader of the NDP believes in a price on pollution. I will prove in a moment that he and his colleagues definitely do not believe that the price on pollution has contributed to inflation and the hardships of Canadians, even though the leader of the NDP said that. Why can he not stand up to the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Carleton, the same way that he was able to stand up to a protester outside, to stand up for what is right? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564678"> I will tell members what I recall. I went around and did some digging as soon as I saw the NDP start to flip-flop on the price on pollution. On June 13 of this year, just before the House left for the summer break, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> said, “the carbon tax does not impact the price of food to nearly the extent the member is saying. It is minuscule.” She goes on to say, “economists, journalists and members of Parliament have made it very clear that the carbon tax is not what is responsible for the cost of food increasing so much.” My question to the member from Edmonton Strathcona, and I hope she asks me a question after I am finished, is this: How did she respond when the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> suddenly said the price on pollution is negatively impacting Canadians? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564679">I have pages and pages of examples, but since I am talking about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation>, I will tell the members something else that she said. On May 30, she quoted an economics professor who said, “‘A clear majority of households do receive rebates that are larger than the carbon taxes they pay for.... If we got rid of the carbon tax and the rebate, then this would harm a much larger fraction of lower- and middle-income households than it would higher-income households.’” That is right. She basically said, on May 30, what I just said the Conservatives are doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564680">They are trying to appease the two out of 10. They are selling it as though they are appeasing the eight out of 10, but they are really trying to put more money back in the pockets of the two out of 10. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> knows that. She agreed with it and spoke to it. Then she had to watch her party's <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> go out and say that he came to the conclusion that the carbon tax and the rebates are not actually helping Canadians more than they are hurting them. This is position that we find ourselves in. I am very glad to see that the NDP and the Bloc are continuing to be the adults in the room, recognizing the stunt that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564681">Did members notice the fanfare that existed on Tuesday when the Conservatives had their opposition motion? It is so dead now. It is totally deflated because of what happened yesterday with the vote. They do not have nearly the energy as they did then. We have not heard from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> on this motion yet. I do not even know if he will speak to it at some point today. The point is, it is all a game for them. I know the NDP knows it was a game for them, yet somehow they caved to the pressure. I want to understand how the NDP got to that point.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564688">The answer to his question is that, when we put a price on something, it incentivizes people to make different choices in the marketplace.

This is how we shape and change market behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564689"> I always find it remarkable that I have to explain to Conservatives how market mechanisms work and how we have to put a price on something to change behaviour, as though it is the first time they have ever heard of it in their entire lives. We have countless examples. CHEO is just one. People and organizations are going to use these opportunities to find other ways. CHEO did it by installing heat pumps, and now its carbon footprint is much less than it was before. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564691"> I think everyone here understands what has happened with the carbon tax, which is that it has not only been weaponized with huge amounts of misinformation being spread by the Conservative Party, but also that it has been ultimately broken by the government, the Liberal Party, because it chose who were winners and who were losers. It chose to pick people and decide on who got it waived and who did not. That is a terrible thing for a government of a country to do for political reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564692">More importantly, New Democrats are coming forward with a meaningful environmental plan that would address the climate crisis, and which would not miss every single target, like the Liberal government has. We have a climate plan that would not subsidize the oil and gas industry and that would not continue to put climate change on the back burner. </ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, given that, after nine years, the government has doubled housing costs, taxed food, punished work, unleashed crime, and is the most centralizing government in Canadian history, the House has lost confidence in the government and offers Canadians the option to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564699">Here is a motion that is asking the House to say it does not have confidence in the government. On behalf of my constituents, I do not have confidence in the government. The easiest way to describe why I do not have confidence in the government is that it is very clear that the government has broken the promise that it has provided to people from around the world to our citizens of Canada. There is a promise of Canada that the government is honour-bound and duty-bound to uphold, and the government has broken it. More importantly, the Liberals have no plan to unbreak that promise. They really do not. I have been listening to the debate, and as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> said today, the government also lacks moral clarity on many issues. Therefore, at this point, it is case closed. The House should not have confidence in the government, and here is why. I want to go back to the broken promise of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564700"> One of the things that has really impacted me and how I look at things in this place is that, in my time here, I became a mom. I am a stepmom to three kids, and I am a grandmother as well, which ages me a little bit. I am now Meemaw. Here is the thing: Much like many other people across Canada, I married somebody from a different country, from the U.S. I love my kids so much. I have watched them grow up. I have watched them go through college and trade school. I am so proud of my oldest stepdaughter. She just graduated and is an emergency room nurse now. My middle stepdaughter graduated from the University of Oklahoma. She is part of the reserve corps in the army, and she is brilliant. My youngest stepson pursued a trade and is essentially running the shop floor of a big manufacturing company in the city where he lives, and he is young.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564701">Because my kids have been able to watch me stand up for my constituents in this place and be part of my work, the one thing that we always talk about as a family is that they have seen first-hand the promise that Canada offers. I can say to them as Americans, and this might get a little testy at Christmas dinner sometimes, that I do believe Canada is the best country in the world. When I look through my community, I see the diversity and our pluralism. What I have always seen is the promise that, if people come to Canada or are in Canada, they can do anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564702"> Frankly, for me right now, one of the most heartbreaking realizations I have had to come to understand is that my children cannot afford to come to this country, and I am in a position of privilege. That is just the reality. I do not say that to be partisan. I say that with absolute reality. My kids cannot afford to buy a house or rent in Canada. They just cannot. We have always talked about it. I have wanted to lure them, especially one of them who is thinking about grad school, to come here to live with us. The reality is that they just cannot afford it. For me, I am living that broken promise in a very deep way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564703"> It is not just my family. It is so many other people in my community who have moved into Calgary Nose Hill from around the world. I had a heartbreaking conversation. I will not say exactly where, just so as not to blow her cover, but an employee from Air Canada came to me in tears, and this conversation absolutely broke my heart.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564704">Her husband had recently passed away, and she has two children and cannot afford her rent. She is in a good job, and she said she does not know what to do. She asked me, “Where do I go?” I do not have an easy answer for that. The reality is that government members do not have an easy answer for that, in spite of doubling the national debt and increasing taxes. They do not have a plan going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564705">We all know that the government does not have a plan. We all know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s head is not in the game of trying to fix the promise of Canada that he broke. He is trying to figure out what his next gig is. Is he going to lead his party through defeat or is he going to have some sort of other job? It is not me saying that. It is virtually every columnist across the country. I am just putting on the record here what the reality is in every newspaper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564706">The House cannot have confidence in somebody who cannot even be bothered to think about how he is going to fix the promise that he broke. It is the reason that my children do not have a clear line of sight on how they can live here, and why millions of other Canadians who are already here cannot afford to live. Is that not enough to say it is over for the government and we should not have confidence in it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564707">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> said, the government does not have moral clarity. I do not have a lot of time in my speech, but let us just go through some of the top scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564708">For the billionaire trip to the Aga Khan's island, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found in breach of the rules by the Ethics Commissioner, found guilty, in 2017. Former finance minister Bill Morneau did not disclose his French villa. Would it not be nice to have a French villa? He also did not declare a conflict with Morneau Shepell. The former defence minister apologized for exaggerating his military record. The Prime Minister, as we all remember, had a disastrous trip to India in 2018, where he invited a convicted attempted murderer to a reception. The former fisheries minister broke the conflict of interest rules with the clam scam issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564709">Then we can fast-forward to 2019, when we had the preposterous SNC-Lavalin and Jody Wilson-Raybould issue. The former environment minister gave $12 million to Loblaws for fridges in direct cash subsidies. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in 2019 made a sarcastic comment to a first nations woman at a fundraiser. In 2019, in the middle of the campaign, he could not tell reporters how many times he had worn blackface. He appointed a governor general who eventually resigned because of such poor vetting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564710">Then we had the WE Charity scandal of a billion dollars, a massive scandal and massive waste. There was a man implicated in a multi-million dollar illegal casino bust in Markham, Ontario, who had rubbed shoulders with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on two occasions before being arrested by police. The former defence minister was censured by MPs over a sexual harassment case in the military. The former public safety minister was unaware of the transfer of notorious murderer Paul Bernardo. The former public safety minister spent $62 million on a firearms buyback program that bought back exactly zero firearms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564711">I have pages more, but I only have a minute left. I will just say this. The government has lost its “why”. It has lost its ability to communicate why it is functioning outside of holding onto power, and it does not have the “how” of how it is going to fix the broken promise that was made to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8564712">I implore colleagues to see that it is time. The House environment is deteriorating rapidly. We need an election. We need an election now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8564716">Second, the Liberal government's dogmatic adherence to the carbon tax does not function in Canada because of the lack of substitute goods. Carbon is price-inelastic in Canada. Because the government has been so focused on increasing the price of everything for everybody, it has stopped innovation in technologies and other types of programs that could reduce emissions, like, for example, having more public transit, as in the Green Line debacle in my riding, which the federal government has absolutely failed on as well. Because it has been so dogmatically attached to the carbon tax, it has made the climate crisis worse in Canada.</ParaText>

I find it interesting that the NDP has now discovered that they have doubled housing costs. A second ago, a Montreal MP stood up to point to a young woman, Pascale, who can no longer afford to rent, much less to own, after housing costs have tripled in that city. When I was housing minister, rent was $700 in Montreal, and we built almost 200,000 units.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565043">This afternoon, we will be dedicated to the Conservative opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565044">Tomorrow, we will consider Bill <Document DbId="13244669" Type="3">C-76</Document>, an act to amend the Canada National Parks Act, which supports the people of Jasper following the devastating wildfires this summer. As per the special order adopted last week, following one round of debate, this important bill will be deemed adopted at all remaining stages and sent to the Senate.</ParaText>

This confidence vote was scheduled to take place yesterday, but, unfortunately, the Conservative members of Parliament blocked it. I think it is because they did not want to lose two confidence motions in a row. I can understand it is embarrassing for them. It seems like they did not want to have that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565047">The Conservatives have also blocked debate on substantive legislation with concurrence debates on five out of nine days since the House returned.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8565050">Madam Speaker, I am the one with the daunting task of calming things down here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565051">As members know, I have been an MP since 2006. Over the years, I have seen Canada evolve and prosper only to slip backwards and lose the essence of the values it holds dear. That fills me with great sadness as a legislator, but also as a father of five children and a grandfather of seven wonderful grandchildren, whose future has been compromised by the bad decisions made by this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565052">People are constantly worrying every day because they no longer believe that our country's legislators are dealing with the real issues and working to address their concerns. This summer, I met Ms. Francine, who shared her concerns with me about the direction that Canada is taking. She said, “I can't take any more of the Prime Minister. When will there be an election?” Her words express the wishes of millions of Canadians who want a new government in our country. These are legitimate concerns, especially when it comes to the national debt, which is over $1.2 trillion, and the interest costs for the public purse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565053">Ms. Francine understands that more interest charges means fewer services and less money in Canadians' pockets for the welfare of the vulnerable. She is also concerned about the price of homes and housing, which puts home ownership out of reach for her beloved grandchildren. She is concerned about everything costing more, with inflation affecting the cost of living, food, housing and energy. I wish I could have reassured her, or at least confirmed an election date, but the Bloc Québécois and the NDP seem to enjoy watching the Liberal government slowly but surely waste away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565054">A minority government has a life expectancy of 20 months, not 48 months. It is in the Bloc Québécois and NDP's hands to allow Canadians to choose who will govern Canada for the next years. With its strong, renewed leadership, the Conservative Party is offering Canadians a credible and exciting opportunity for the future of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565055">We can offer security and reassurance for the future, because we have a proven track record. The current Conservative government balanced the budget. It worked to create and keep jobs here, cracked down on crime, did not encourage the use of harmful drugs, engaged in missions to restore peace, and ensured that all citizens had the chance to make the most of their opportunities by having a good paycheque and leaving more money in their pockets. The previous Conservative government was consistent and did whatever it took to meet the needs expressed by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565056">Today, Canadians are living with the consequences of the bad choices made by a reckless Liberal minority government that has been kept in power since 2019 by two opportunistic parties that take turns blackmailing it for their own benefit, to the detriment of the Canadian population. This illegitimate Liberal government, which the NDP and Bloc Québécois are keeping on life support, has dragged us into serious challenges and crises that we may not be able to overcome now or in the years to come unless something changes soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565057">I do not know if the Liberal government can hear me, but I can certainly hear them here in the House talking on the other side—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8565063">Madam Speaker, I was proud to be elected as part of a Conservative government that expanded the promise of a better Canada, lowered inflation, cut the GST and taxes for small business, and balanced the budget, all while increasing health transfers faster than any other government in history. Personal incomes rose by 10% after inflation and taxes. In fact, we did more than we promised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565064">Now, after nine years under this disastrous <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Canadian promise is broken. This Prime Minister has broken numerous promises and dashed many of our hopes. He has not balanced the budget. He has not cut taxes for the middle class. There still is not enough affordable housing. In addition to going back on his word, the Prime Minister refuses to face up to the fact that he is no good for our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565065">Being born in or living in Canada no longer comes with the assurance of a minimum threshold for living in dignity and decency. This was a promise that everyone in Canada once received as a native-born Canadian or as an immigrant to this country. It is so sad to see young people working hard but staying longer, even too long, in their parents' homes. It is appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565066">The Bloc Québécois has voted more than 189 times to keep this Prime Minister in power. It has voted for $500 billion in inflationary, bureaucratic and centralizing spending. I would add that this $500 billion does not include health care funding or money for seniors. Those funds are external and are already set out in law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565067">It is truly scandalous to see all the money that is going to consultants, bureaucrats, interest groups and big business, all subsidized by the state. It is even more shocking to see the Bloc Québécois laughing at us at the same time, voting to increase gas taxes, including in Quebec, with the second carbon tax that does apply in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565068">I am also thinking of the Bloc Québécois's support for capital gains taxes, which will force Quebec farmers, entrepreneurs, doctors and home builders to pay more money to Ottawa, only for those funds to be controlled here by the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565069">I was part of a Conservative government that increased health transfers. Now the Bloc Québécois wants to keep the most centralizing and costly prime minister in our history in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565070">The Prime Minister, with his immigration policy that even his own minister admits is out of control, has pushed Quebec to the breaking point. The Bloc Québécois does not even think that immigration is an important issue. In other words, Quebeckers are far down on the list of the Bloc Québécois's interests and priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565071">It is also important to remember that during the past nine years under this colossal and ineffective government, the Prime Minister doubled the national debt. That means he alone spent more than all the prime ministers before him. He spent more in nine years than all the others did in 148 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565072">That debt has a material impact on ordinary people. It means that currently, under this Liberal government, all the money taxpayers spend on GST is being used just to cover the interest on the debt. Unless something is done, these payments will continue to increase, further mortgaging the future of the next generations and their right to a government that has its books in order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565073">Is that what democracy is about? Is it about keeping the government in a position of weakness indefinitely? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565074">While the Bloc Québécois and the NDP circle around the Liberals like vultures, hoping for some gains that they are very unlikely to get, voters are clear about wanting a carbon tax election. The current situation is not normal. Nothing about it is normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565075">Voters did not vote for that in 2021. First of all, if they had known that the NDP was going to form a dishonourable coalition with the Liberals, the outcome of the election probably would have been very different. The same is currently true of the Bloc Québécois. Voters did not vote for that party, which has voted 189 times to keep the Prime Minister in power. Time is up. Why is the Bloc Québécois too afraid to give voters the choice right now? The “Liberal Bloc” is a very appropriate name. What image are we portraying to the international community? Do other countries see a strong, proud Canada that is secure in itself and its destiny, or a Canada where the government is unstable and voters are urgently calling for an election?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565076">Let us talk about the infamous carbon tax. It is the most unproductive government tax ever created in Canadian history, because, like all other taxes, it not only takes money out of taxpayers' pockets, but it also puts Canadian businesses at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of other countries. When it costs more to manufacture in Canada than elsewhere, it forces our businesses to move away and discourages foreign investment in Canada.</ParaText>

For all these reasons, we are going to vote to bring down this government in order to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>

Why not? It is the language of the sloganeer. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565098">Let us talk about the CBC, the Conservatives' bugbear. How did the CBC get started? It was started in some way with CN, because in the early days CN was looking for ways to keep its passengers entertained, so they created a kind of radio network, an entertainment system of the day, for their trains, and then that kind of morphed into an organization called CNR Radio. In 1932, on the heels of that, R.B. Bennett established CBC's predecessor, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission.</ParaText>

CEPA, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, was enacted in 1988 by Mr. Mulroney. It was designed to provide a systematic national approach to assessing and managing chemical substances in the environment, as well as to create criminal law offences for polluters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565101">Quebec probably saw that centralization as an unwelcome intrusion into provincial jurisdiction at the time. I would think that would be the case, because Hydro-Québec, a provincial Crown corporation, went up against the federal government in court to argue that the federal government had no jurisdiction and that it was essentially invading provincial jurisdiction, but the Supreme Court of Canada found that the federal government did have jurisdiction and that this was a matter of national interest, and therefore criminal law power was justified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565102">Let us look at national parks. The Canadian national park system began in November 1885, when the federal government of Sir John A. Macdonald set aside an area of approximately 26 square kilometres on the northern slopes of Alberta's Sulphur Mountain for public use. I suppose in today's terms it would be seen as an intrusion by the federal government into provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565104">Let us look at, more recently, the unfair elections act, which is a perfect example of a heavy-handed approach by a federal government with a majority. As a matter of fact, the sponsor of the legislation was the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. Of course, the government was using its majority's power to attempt to suppress votes in what was, as they say, a heavy-handed and top-down approach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565107">Since the motion mentions the price on carbon, let us be clear that there is no carbon tax; the Supreme Court has said so.

We cannot help but notice a definite lack of enthusiasm from across the way if we contrast today to last Tuesday. I suspect there was a bit of an accountability check on Wednesday when the Conservative Party did not get what it wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565136">What the Conservatives want is not what is in the best interest of Canadians. They want what is in the best interest of the Conservative Party and its <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>. That is why I often talk about their thirst and quest for power. They let nothing get in their way, according to the Conservatives. They strive for power for the sake of having power, and power alone. We have seen that virtually from day one with the Conservatives being the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565137">I want to approach it in a different way, because I only have 10 minutes this time around, and talk about some of the things we know about the Conservative Party, or what I like to refer to as the Conservative-Reform party. When I say Conservative-Reform party, I do not say it lightly. At the end of the day, we see a party that has taken a very hard right turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565138">Many, including myself, would suggest the Conservative Party has adopted many of the thoughts and ideas that flow from our neighbours to the south, the far right or the MAGA right. We should all be concerned about that because there is a very strong negative side to it. We see it through things like character assassination, the spreading of misinformation and the discrediting of our traditional media. These are things we should all be aware of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565139">I want to highlight some things I think most Canadians would be very surprised and disappointed by. One of them is in regard to the Canada Infrastructure Bank. We hear Conservative members say they are going to get rid of the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Many of them will say the Canada Infrastructure Bank has not done anything, and therefore, they are going to get rid of it and save money for Canadians. However, nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565140">I can give the facts right now. We have $10 billion of investment coming through the public, matched by virtually $20 billion of outside investment. We have $30 billion being spent throughout different regions. Every region is receiving money and support in building Canada's infrastructure. We know that. Anyone can look it up and they can see it first-hand. However, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, who will likely be addressing the House soon, does not have a problem giving misinformation and saying the Canada Infrastructure Bank has not done anything and the Conservatives are going to get rid of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565141">The biggest myth out there is this whole idea that the people of Canada will benefit from getting rid of the carbon rebate. Conservatives go out and tell Canadians they are going to “axe the tax”, or get rid of the carbon tax, but they say nothing about the rebate. They say nothing about the 80% of Canadians who receive more money as a direct result of this particular policy. That is a fact. It is not something that is coming just from members of the Liberal Party. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8565142">It was not that long ago that all parties in the House agreed that a price on pollution is an effective tool. The government has developed a tool to ensure that the vast majority of Canadians, 80% or more, are receiving more back. That does not match up with the Conservatives' bumper sticker or slogans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565143">It is just like the housing issue. When the Conservatives talk about it, they say they are going to get out there and build more homes. History will show that one of the worst individuals we could ever turn to to deal with the housing issue is in fact the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, because he was the minister of housing. As has been pointed out by numerous members, when he was the minister he was an absolute disaster. One reason we have the problem to the extent we have today is his lack of action when he was the minister of housing. By the way, for the record, he built six houses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565144">Some of the greatest accomplishments of the government, I believe, outside of things like the $198 billion toward health care and the many progressive measures the Liberals have taken, are some of the economic measures. No government in the history of Canada has signed off on more trade agreements than this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government. That is a fact. Liberals recognize the value in supporting Canada's middle class, and those aspiring to be part of it, by freeing up and opening those trade lines that are critical to Canada's future. We have been very successful at that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565145">For the first time ever, the Conservative Party actually voted against one of our trade agreements. Amazingly, it was the Canada-Ukraine trade agreement. It was because of an issue that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation>, in principle, did not like, even though Ukraine has a price on pollution. The things we hear that come from the Conservative Party are borderline at best. I would suggest that most often they are of a very ridiculous nature. Trying to flush out the Conservatives' issues is a challenge. What do they have to say about dental care? They vote against it. What do they have to say about child care? Do members remember that in the last election they said they were going to tear it up?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565146">These are the types of programs that are helping Canadians in every region. Therefore, when we get members talking about the Conservative hidden agenda, people should be concerned. When Conservatives talk about things like fixing the budget, that is code for Conservative cuts. They are not going to provide the types of programs we have been able to put together over the last number of years that benefit literally millions of Canadians. These things are at risk, because the Conservatives are more focused on trying to fool Canadians. That is what they are banking on. They want the election as soon as possible because they believe that the longer the House sits, it is slipping away from them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565147">Canadians will become more aware of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and what he actually stands for. As we see the contrast between the government of the day and what Conservatives have to offer, as we continue to work for Canadians while the Conservatives play games, prevent things from ultimately passing and play an obstructive role here in the chamber, Canadians will see through that.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, given that, after nine years, the government has doubled housing costs, taxed food, punished work, unleashed crime, and is the most centralizing government in Canadian history, the House has lost confidence in the government and offers Canadians the option to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565162">Let us start with the first point: that “the government has doubled housing costs”. There is no debating that. It is basic math. Unfortunately, we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> who says that the economy is not numbers or figures, it is people. Rent is a number. The cost of a mortgage is a number. When someone buys a house, the price is measured in numbers. Numbers control the universe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565163">Here are the facts. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in 2015 was $973. Now it is $1,877. It has doubled. For a two-bedroom apartment, again, rent has doubled from $1,172 to $2,337. That is twice as much. The amount needed for a down payment on an average home has doubled from $22,000 to $47,000. That is twice as much. The mortgage payment for an average new home was $1,400 in 2015. Now it is $3,000. It has doubled. There is no debating that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565164">Let us move on to the next point, which is that the government “taxed food”. People may agree with the Prime Minister and the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois </Affiliation> that a carbon tax is good. People may think that a 61¢-a-litre tax is the best idea in the history of the world, but they cannot deny that it increases the cost of food because farmers use fossil fuels to power their machinery. Truckers have to use diesel. This is the first carbon tax, and it applies across Canada. It applies to Quebec indirectly because all the food produced in and transported from the rest of Canada costs more. The second carbon tax, which the federal government is imposing with the support of the Bloc Québécois, will increase the cost of gas by 17¢ a litre. That will directly increase farmers' costs, and therefore consumers' costs as well. There is no debating the fact that the government is taxing food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565165">The third point says that the government has “punished work”. According to the Fraser Institute, recognized as the most prestigious academic institute in the country, 80% of middle-class Canadians are paying more taxes than they used to. Taxes penalize work. People who work harder pay more. That is penalizing work. On top of that, the government has blocked a number of natural resource development projects. It is allowing the Americans to kill forestry jobs. It is considering issuing a radical Liberal order on caribou that will kill jobs and punish work at the same time. There is no debate on that either. The government is punishing work.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8565166">It is also allowing crime to spiral out of control. The Liberals passed three main bills. The legislation arising from Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C‑75</Document> provides for the automatic release of criminals, and crime in Canada has increased by 50%. Gun crime has increased by 121%. Despite spending $69 million, the Liberals have failed to remove a single rifle banned in Canada since their big election announcements on this issue. Today, gun crime is up, as is crime in general. In addition, 47,000 people have lost their lives to drug overdoses since the government liberalized drugs. There is no debating that. Since this government came to power, there has been more crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565167">Lastly, this is a centralizing government. We have seen excessive centralization. There is no need for me to argue this point, since the <Affiliation DbId="278793" Type="7">House leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> has done it for me. He said, and I quote, “For the first time in history, excessive centralization became a fact of life. Despite its difficulty in managing its own responsibilities, this government started poking its nose into the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565168">This is the biggest, most centralizing and most costly government. It added 100,000 public servants, who meddle in Quebec's business. It doubled spending on consultants. It doubled the debt. This centralizing and costly government punishes work, taxes food and doubled the cost of housing. The evidence is clear. That is why Quebeckers deserve to choose a government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. That is exactly want we are proposing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565169">We are calling on all the opposition parties to show their independence from this centralizing government and vote to allow their constituents to choose a new government that would allow Canadians to bring home a bigger paycheque to buy food and gas in a safe community. That is common sense. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565172">Let us go through the items one by one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565173">Did the Liberals double housing costs? Let us look at prices. In 2015, the average rent for a one-bedroom was $973 and today it is $1,877. In 2015, the average cost of monthly rent for a two-bedroom was $1,072 and today it is $2,337. In 2015, the average down payment needed for a new home was $22,000 and today it is $47,000. In 2015, the average mortgage payment on an average new home was $1,400 and today it is $3,020. There is no debate; it is double trouble when it comes to housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565174">Are the Liberals taxing food? Well, they admit they are taxing diesel, which is what powers combines, tractors and other equipment. They admit they are taxing the natural gas that dries the grains in the silos. They admit they are taxing the truckers who bring us our food. There is no debate there. They want to quadruple that tax to 61¢ a litre. There is no debate on that either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565175"> Are the Liberals punishing work? They have increased income taxes on 80% of middle-class people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565176"> Are the Liberals unleashing crime? Violent crime is up 50% and gun crime is up 120%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565177"> Are the Liberals a centralist government? They doubled their debt. They have doubled the amount of money for consultants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565178"> All of these points are proven. That is why Canadians deserve the chance to elect a common-sense Conservative government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime so that hard work earns a powerful paycheque that buys affordable food and homes in safe neighbourhoods where the promise of Canada is restored in the freest country on earth, Canada. Let us bring it home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565181">The first question has to do with the tramway. Quebec City is the only city of its size in North America that does not have an integral public transit system. This summer there was some confusion. The Quebec lieutenant for the Conservative Party, who is sitting right next to him, said that, even if the Conservatives came to power, there would still be funding for the tramway. He then quickly changed his mind and said that, no matter how far along the project was, a Conservative federal government would not be providing funding. This directly affects residents of Quebec City. The Conservatives can confer on the benches and respond directly. Where do they stand on the tramway? Are they going to provide funding for it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565182">My second question for the Leader of the Opposition is this. There are 8,200 seniors in Sainte-Foy, Sillery and Cap-Rouge in my riding who have enrolled in the dental plan that we introduced and who have benefited from it over the past year. There will be a lot more people who will benefit next year when the program is opened to people between the ages of 18 and 64. What does he have to say to them? This is very real care that seniors in my riding received thanks to this program. I would like to hear his thoughts on that.</ParaText>

The Bloc Québécois wants to interfere in Quebec's jurisdiction to stop Quebec from building a third link. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565203">Madam Speaker, I would like to let the hon. <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> be aware that during my election campaign, when she characterized me in front of a national audience as “cold, cruel and small”, she had it wrong. Throughout this speech, I think she will perhaps learn that I am a warm, generous and kind human being, but mis-characterization is the MO of the Liberal Party. I have only been here two weeks, and I have already seen it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565204">The day I was sworn in, I walked through the halls of West Block and something colourful caught my eye. It was the red head of a small five- or six-year-old boy who was getting a tour or walking around with his mom or his dad. The young boy was gazing around at these tall columns and the thick walls that hold up this endlessly high ceiling. I too feel not unlike that small red-headed boy when I take my place here in the Parliament of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565205">Those thick walls represent to me the strong foundation upon which Canada has been built over many years, a foundation that was laid over those years, including before Canada the country came into being. For a nation like this one, we continue to build upon the foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565206">The great Sir Wilfrid Laurier put it well: “I want the marble to remain marble; the granite to remain granite; the oak to remain oak; and out of these elements, I would build a nation great among the nations of the world.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565207">I want to touch briefly upon those builders, whom we have come to identify as Canadians. The indigenous peoples were the original inhabitants of this land. We must continue our efforts toward reconciliation. First nations, Métis and Inuit, along with the people who came later, principally the French and English in the early days, laid the groundwork for what would become the Dominion of Canada. Given the lamentable state of Canadian history education in our country, I hesitate to call attention to some of the greatest citizens for fear of losing my audience at home, but for posterity's sake, and in recognition of what they did to help build this country, I will take that risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565208">Some of the greats, while strictly speaking may not have been Canadians, were builders of this great land of what would become known as Canada: the great generals, Montcalm and Wolfe; Sir Isaac Brock and Sir Arthur Currie; scientists, like Banting and Best; and our early foundational prime ministers, MacDonald and Laurier. Let us not forget Colonel R.S. McLaughlin from Oshawa, my hometown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565209"> Canadian heroes come from many walks of life. I am thinking of examples like Terry Fox; sports heroes like Wayne Gretzky or Tom Longboat; artists like Gord Downie and Ottawa's own, and a personal favourite, Paul Anka. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565210">Of course, we have to make room for the more recent greats. Summer McIntosh impressed us all this summer at the Paris Olympics, not only with her phenomenal athleticism, but also with her grace and poise on the podium and elsewhere. I hear last month she was even old enough to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565211"> All Canadians will have their own list of favourite great Canadians. The list to choose from is nearly endless. I encourage all of us to celebrate them in our own ways and not just in this place. We need more celebration of Canadian history. As the great historian Jack Granatstein wrote in his famous 1998 book, <I>Who Killed Canadian History?</I>, “History is memory, inspiration, and commonality—and a nation without memory is every bit adrift as an amnesiac wandering the streets. History matters, and we forget this truth at our peril.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565212">There is one more group of people I will also include in the list of great Canadians: the members, the veterans and the families of our Canadian Armed Forces: the army, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Navy and Special Operations Forces. We salute both the regular and reservists, who, in the words of Winston Churchill, are “twice the citizen”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565213">Our national foundation supports our aspirations for greatness and that is what we are in this place to do. That is what the people of Toronto—St. Paul's have asked me to do: preserve what we have and build something better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565214">We must focus on what unites us as Canadians and not on what divides us. We must not pick winners, but create an environment where anyone from anywhere can do anything. That is the Canadian promise. We also strive for peace, order and good government. This is the Canadian way. There are foundational Canadian values that we hold dear and must protect. These are the foundational Canadian values that appeared to be at risk in recent months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565215">I have witnessed, in our Canadian streets and on our Canadian campuses, so-called protests calling for the death of those in our Jewish community. They are sponsored by known terrorist-linked entities. This is not the Canadian way. When foundational Canadian values are under attack, we are all under attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565216">However, this government supports the funding of those who would take on this anti-Canadian charge. Employees of UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, in part funded by the Canadian government, are known to have held hostages on October 7. Canada is, in part, paying the salaries of combatants who work for the Hamas terrorist regime. It was these same Hamas terrorists who murdered eight of our fellow citizens: good people from Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and elsewhere. Their names were Alexandre Look, Ben Mizrachi, Adi Vital-Kaploun, Shir Georgy, Vivian Silver, Netta Epstein, Tiferet Lapidot and Judih Weinstein Haggai. May their memories be a blessing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565217">There are still 101 hostages being held in Gaza and not all amongst the living. People held against their will, held in the darkness and dampness of a subterranean warren of war, a tunnel system created for the sole purpose of waging war. Every day, I think about those people held in captivity in those deplorable conditions, and I think, too, of the innocents of Gaza, used as human shields by an uncivilized terrorist organization. I encourage all in this place to do the same and give thought to these victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565218">I made my remarks earlier about Canadian history and Canadian heroes because I care deeply about this country and its past, but I care equally about the future of this great nation. I got into political life not because I am crazy, but because I thought about my two daughters, Leah and Charlotte, both in their 20s. I thought about the kids I see in the park and the ones I see clinging to their mothers' legs when I knock on doors. I thought about the fact that they do not appear to have the same opportunities for success as young people did a generation ago. They do not have the same Canada. This is not the same Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565219">We must leave a country in better shape than we found it. Can we say that is true for the NDP-Liberal government members and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who took over nine years ago? Does anyone even believe they have what it takes? The economics of this country have become stagnant. The feeling of optimism has evaporated. The sense that Canada has a great destiny thrust into the intention of the future, as the philosopher George Grant put it, is absent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565220">I am here, thanks to the good people of Toronto—St. Paul's, to be a part of something bigger than any single one of us. I am here to help build a better country, one day at a time. I am here to work my hardest for the people of my riding, yes, but also for every last person in this country. Let us remember that as we engage in the great debates of our country. I am new and that is, perhaps, why I am filled with so much optimism. Optimism can take us a long way, and I am delighted to be here.</ParaText>

His ability to go from being a civilian low-ranking, not high-military, officer as he went into the war and to use basic, common-sense skills of building community together to prepare for and to lead the Canadian Armed Forces in some of the key conflicts of World War I goes down in history forever.

              <ParaText id="8565236">Let me start by giving two data points. Recently, Bloomberg commissioned a study conducted by Nanos Research. It was a four-week tracking poll ending September 20, and it was on the Canadian consumer confidence index. Canadian consumer confidence has reached a 29-month high. The last time we had this much Canadian consumer confidence was way back in April 2022. The second data point I would like to bring to our notice is the inflation rate. It has now come down to 2%. It is the eighth straight month that inflation is within the target set by the Bank of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565237">Inflation hit a high way back in June 2022. Obviously, we all felt the pain of that inflation and the resulting interest rates. The inflation basically started during the pandemic and, postpandemic, due to supply chain disruptions, the inflation hit very high. The Bank of Canada had to do its duty to control inflation. It started dramatically raising interest rates. For the first time in the history of Canada, we saw a dramatic, huge rise in interest rates in a very short period of time. It affected all. It affected inflation, interest rates and mortgage payments. It affected all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565238"> We felt the pain. The grocery costs and the grocery bills were high. The fuel costs got high. This created genuine frustration and anger among all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565239">It is not surprising that Canadians, now, are maybe opening up and ready to listen to the economic story. The politicians made use of this anger and frustration and amplified it. Not only did politicians amplify it, but also social media and the algorithms amplified it. They amplified this and allowed politicians to seize on the discontent to fuel the anger more. I think some of these people banked their political success on the failure of a Canadian economy. That is not going to be the case. The economy has done well compared to any other G7 country. The economic good news is bad news for a few politicians in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565240">They advised us. They said that all the spending or the support programs we had launched to help needy Canadians was fuelling inflation further. They advised us to have austerity measures, but we continued to support Canadians in need. We stood firm. We now see inflation back to 2%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565241"> Canada is the best performing economy in the entirety of the G7 countries. IMF recently made a report that said it forecasted that Canada's performance will be the best not only in 2024 but also in 2025, leading among all G7 countries. The world is being reshaped by four major shifts: green transition, artificial intelligence, geopolitics and friendshoring, and changing demographics. We have carefully looked at these four major changes that are reshaping the world, taken measures and made investments that will benefit Canadians today and tomorrow. We are already beginning to see the results.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8565242"> In the forthcoming months and years, we will see the much more visible positive effects of what we have done so far. Through the mines to mobility strategy, we have seized on the changing transition to the clean economy. We have been investing in everything from the mining of critical minerals to the setting up of mineral processing companies, from battery plants to electrical vehicles manufacturing. We have been doing that. We are already seeing the good effects of that, but they will be much more visible in the coming months and years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565243"> There are certain myths that have been propagated for a long time in Canada. Let me touch upon them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565244"> One myth is that the Canadian federal government is spending high and that the debt is very high. However, we have the smallest deficit-to-GDP ratio amongst all G7 countries. I repeat, it is smallest deficit-to-GDP ratio among all of the G7 countries. Our net debt to GDP is also the lowest among all of the G7 countries. Colleagues need not take our word, or even the IMF's word, but they can take that of the rating companies, which are the final arbitrators in this. Let me quote the statement of Fitch Ratings from just two months back. On July 24, Fitch Ratings said, “Canada's ratings reflect strong governance, high per-capita income and a macroeconomic policy framework that has delivered steady growth and generally low inflation”. Taking a look at every G7 country, at their deficit to GDP, the net debt to GDP, or the ratings, we see that we are the best. That is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565245">The second myth is that taxes are making Canada uncompetitive. That is very far from the truth. In fact, we have the lowest effective tax rates on new business in, again, all of the G7 countries. If someone goes back and checks the IMF reports or the OECD reports, they will find that the effective tax rate for new business is the lowest in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565246">The third myth is that the government is driving investments away. Again, this is a myth that has been propagated by politicians. Usually these days, I do not invest in the stock market, but a couple of days back, I just happened to look to see where the stock market is at. Canadian TSX year-to-date gain has reached 14%. In the first nine months, there are 14% returns from the Canadian TSX. I think the budget was on April 16. Since the budget, the stock exchange index has returned more than 10%. I am not saying that that should be the only criteria to measure what Canada is doing for investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565247">The second, again, hard cash measurement data I have has to do with foreign direct investment. There is no charity in business. Multinational companies do not invest just for the sake of investing or just to make the Canadian federal government look good. They invest because they see opportunity. Canada has a high rate of foreign direct investment. I think Canada is second or third among all OECD countries. Per capita, the federal direct investment is the best among all G7 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565248">In closing, I quickly want to say that we are not perfect. Are there any economic indicators that we are still lagging behind? Yes, such as productivity, for example. However, the best part of Canada is that we know we have to improve and we are working hard to improve. That is what makes Canada great. I am so proud to be a part of this moment when we are transitioning into a clean economy in a much greater way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565251">Madam Speaker, things were really tough, and I am the first person to agree. More people are going to a food bank, which is also a fact. As I said, after the pandemic, inflation shot up, interest rates shot up and mortgage payments shot up. Even working families found it hard. However, we did provide support to all those in need, and we continue to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565252">Things are changing. The fact is that inflation has come down to 2%, and the interest rates have fallen to 4.25%. The Bank of Canada is meeting next on October 23. It is not a question of whether the interest rate will reduce further, but a question of whether the Bank of Canada is going to reduce it by 0.25% or 0.5%. The market economists are forecasting that the interest rate will come down to 3% by July 2025. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8565263">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House this evening to speak to the motion before the House today. It is a pleasure and a privilege every day to represent the people of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country. I am grateful to be in the House, to work on matters and to do the business of the nation. This is why it is a little unfortunate that, for the second time this week, we are basically debating the same motion. There are many issues we could be discussing today and parts of the business of government that we could be looking into. I think it is unfortunate that we are again debating a motion from the Conservative Party to stop our work as parliamentarians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565264">Today, I want to comment on the motion before us and the common slogans we hear from the Conservatives. I want to set the record straight about what their slogans really mean. I am going to go through them one by one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565265">When Conservatives say that we should axe the tax, they are really talking about axing the facts. I want to get into this because we have seen a disproportionate amount of time of the House spent talking about the carbon tax, and the Conservatives consistently misrepresent what this is. It is a measure that is going to contribute 40% of Canada's emissions reductions. It is also an affordability measure because 80% of Canadians get more money back with the rebate than they end up paying into it. This is particularly so for low-to-modest income Canadians, who get a disproportionate amount when we consider the costs and benefits. However, the Conservatives do not like these facts or the fact that 300 economists have confirmed this, because they like to use alternative facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565266">What is worse is that Conservatives also plan on proposing to get rid of the industrial carbon pricing system, which would let the biggest polluters off for free. There are, of course, other ways to reduce emissions, which cost more and take many more years to roll out. However, that is actually what they want. What do they say will happen in place? They say that we will have technology, not taxes. However, the only technology they talk about has not been proven to work right now or is not going to be available for many years. We can think of such things as wide-scale applications of carbon capture and small modular reactors for nuclear. We do not hear them talk about renewable energy or anything that is able to reduce emissions in the short term. We can look at what their cousins in Alberta have done, when they did everything they could to cancel a renewable energy industry that was the envy of the country. In the process, they chased away billions of dollars of investment. Their real plan is to distract by talking about the carbon tax, to delay more action and to dismiss the idea that we need to take real action to safeguard our climate and our future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565267">This should not be surprising; it is the modus operandi of Conservatives. When they were last in power, they did quite a bit of work to axe the facts by doing such things as ending the long-form census and reducing funding for Stats Canada. Without any notice, through an omnibus legislation, they gutted the Fisheries Act and the Environmental Assessment Act. They also muzzled scientists so that they could not speak to the public about any of the science that they were doing, especially on climate change. We also know that they did their best to declare that environmental NGOs were violent criminal groups so that they could use the RCMP to monitor them and weaponize the CRA to go after their charitable status. This was done because they want to be able to base government decisions on slogans and ideology rather than on science and evidence. We know this is real because Conservatives do not believe that climate change is real or that immediate action is required to address it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565268">They also say that they plan to build homes, but what they are actually proposing is to block homes. When the Conservatives were last in power, housing construction was as low as 150,000 units in a year, a number that we nearly doubled in 2022. When the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was in charge of the housing file, a measly six affordable units were built across the country. Throughout this time, 800,000 affordable units were lost because he does not believe in things like cooperative housing, which he refers to as Soviet-style housing. At this time, they completely abdicated all responsibility for getting housing built and downloaded it to the provinces and municipalities. We are still paying the price for that today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8565269">To give some perspective, in my riding alone in the last five years, during which I have had the pleasure of serving as representative, the government has supported over 1,000 below-market units that have been constructed. We have been steadily working with municipalities to support them to speed up the permitting process, and we see provinces like British Columbia that are doing that work as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565270"> What is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>'s strategy to build the homes? He wants to raise taxes on apartments and cut funding for programs that are getting housing built. Rather than work with municipalities, he and his B.C. Conservative brethren plan to scrap policies that are getting gentle density going in cities and restrict infrastructure funding. I do not understand the magical thinking that if we get rid of gentle density, we will get more housing, but maybe the Conservatives' plan is to do more things like paving over the greenbelt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565271">Trying to bully municipalities into getting housing built under these restrictions, by saying they would restrict infrastructure funding, does not actually mean that much, considering the amount of funding the Conservatives provided for infrastructure, which, among other things, was 13 times less than the amount of funding for transit we have provided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565272"> The other thing the Conservatives like to talk about is fixing the budget, but their history has really been about gutting the budget. The Conservatives like to think of themselves as good stewards of the public finances, but the reality is that their last two administrations in office completely exploded the budget. The Conservatives racked up more debt than all previous prime ministers combined. The only balanced budget that the Harper government ran was a few months after it won office in 2006, when it inherited surpluses. It desperately and unsuccessfully tried to balance the budget in 2015 by selling off GM stock for a song.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565273">Let us talk about what the Conservatives plan to do with the budget. They cut services before. They cut military spending to a record low, and they provided huge giveaways to some of the most wealthy people in the country. The hope of the Conservative ideology of trickle-down economics, or trumped-up economics, is that by cutting services and cutting taxes, they would massively grow the economy. However, again the facts just do not bear that out. That is probably why they want some alternative facts to the reality that in the last year of when the Conservatives were in office, GDP dropped almost 14%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565274">What are the Conservatives planning to do now? They are planning to cut child care programs, end the dental care program that is already providing dental insurance for 750,000 Canadians, end programs that are getting housing built right across the country and end programs that are positioning Canada's economy to thrive in a low-carbon future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565275">The last part of the Conservatives' plan is that they say they are going to stop the crime. However, I would more appropriately refer to the plan as ditching the charter. They want to make us think that we are experiencing some massive crime wave, that crime is at an all-time high, but in fact when we look at the data, we see that the crime rate is actually lower than it was in many years when the Conservatives were in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565276">The Conservatives believe that if they fearmonger, people will not pay attention to the facts. What did the Conservatives do in the past? They said that by taking tough-on-crime measures, by passing legislation that involved very long mandatory minimum sentences, they were able to keep people safe. In practice, there was just an overincarceration of people in many minority groups in Canada, and the courts threw the legislation out for being incompatible with the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565277"> On top of that, the Conservatives gutted funding for the RCMP, the CBSA and crime prevention programs, and they disbanded the Integrated Proceeds of Crime Section, which was tackling money laundering. These things, all together, put us in a very difficult position, and crimes like money laundering have flourished since then. One thing that all Canadians should be very concerned about is that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> is openly saying that he plans to sidestep the charter and invoke the notwithstanding clause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565278">When we look at what the Conservatives actually intend to do compared to what they are saying, we see what their hidden agenda is. Their plan for project 2025 is not one that Canadians want. Canadians want an economy that works for everyone, where the least fortunate people are supported, and that we can build for a prosperous future and tackle the challenges we have today. That is why I will be voting against the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565293"> The law clerk had been directed to report to the Speaker on whether the respondents had, in fact, fully complied with the House order, by the stipulated deadline of 30 days following the adoption of the order.

As we have been informed, there were many redactions and omissions, which were made by the various departments and agencies that produced the documents. The House order, indeed, did not explicitly require that the documents be provided in unredacted form, nor did it make provision for departments and agencies to pre-emptively omit or redact portions of documents or documents in their entirety. On this matter, only the House can judge if it is satisfied with the production of documents that it has received.</ParaText>

He stated in the Debates, at page 2043, the following: “procedural authorities are categorical in repeatedly asserting the powers of the House in ordering the production of documents. No exceptions are made for any category of government documents”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565307"> The government House leader attempted to argue that this particular order for documents was different, insofar as the documents were not to assist members in carrying out their duties but instead to be transmitted to a third party. For this reason, she claimed that the order was beyond the authority of the House. The Chair would suggest, respectfully, that these concerns ought to have been raised prior to the motion’s adoption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565308">I would remind members that, if there are concerns about the procedural admissibility of any motion, they should be raised with the Chair before the motion is debated or, at the latest, before the House is called upon to vote on the matter. It would be difficult, perhaps even inappropriate, now for the Chair to retroactively comment on its admissibility.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565309">As it stands, the motion was adopted. The House has clearly ordered the production of certain documents, and that order has clearly not been fully complied with. The Chair cannot come to any other conclusion but to find that a prima facie question of privilege has been established. However, before inviting the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> to proceed with the moving of a motion, I would like to make a few comments on the type of motion the Chair would consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565310">The members who intervened on this question used words such as “unusual”, “novel” and “unprecedented” to describe this particular production order. The Chair agrees with those characterizations. It is indeed unusual, novel and unprecedented for the House to order documents not for its own purposes but for a third party. The Chair also notes that the intended recipient of the information, the RCMP, has expressed to our law clerk its serious reservations about receiving these documents, at least in their current form. Both the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278653" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation> argued that this is not the House’s concern and that the RCMP can simply refuse the information if it wishes. Before insisting on the production of documents, as the opposition House leader proposes to do, the Chair believes the House would benefit from having this matter studied further.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8565311">In his landmark ruling on documents relating to Afghan detainees on April 27, 2010, Speaker Milliken spoke eloquently of the need for reflection, collaboration and even accommodation in such matters. While asserting unequivocally that the House had the right to order the production of papers, he also recognized that the House generally understands that the government has responsibilities to protect certain information.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8565312"> In that case, it was a matter of balancing national security concerns with the duty of elected representatives to hold the government accountable for its decisions. In the case before us, the government, the RCMP and even the Auditor General, an officer of Parliament, have expressed concerns about providing the documents in question to the RCMP. While it is ultimately for the House to decide how it wishes to proceed in the face of such objections, the Chair is of the view that it would be valuable to afford an opportunity for the concerns expressed by the RCMP, as well as by the Auditor General, to be addressed fully and, I would hope, for a mutually satisfactory solution to be arrived at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565313">I believe the best way for this to be achieved would be to follow the usual course for a prima facie question of privilege, that is, a referral to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Such a referral would allow for a more detailed consideration of what documents remain to be submitted, what has been withheld and why, and, most importantly, how the House can ensure the intended recipient, the RCMP, is in a position to act as the House would wish it to act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565324">I would like to thank the Speaker for upholding one of the most important principles of parliamentary democracy, which is that those who are tasked with the awesome responsibility of making laws, passing taxation measures and spending money have all the information that they could possibly need to properly do their jobs. Here in the House, we vote on all different kinds of legislation. We vote on laws that touch on broadcasting, on agriculture and on food-labelling laws, and to do that, we need to make sure that we fully understand all the issues and all the possible ramifications of our decisions. To do that, at various stages along the legislative process, we rely on information, usually in the form of either testimony from witnesses or of documents and papers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565325"> The same is true when we talk about taxation. Those who remember our political science lessons, either in high school or in university, know that there is one characteristic that separates government from every other institution and every other entity in our society. The one thing that truly makes government different from any other organization is its monopoly on the use of force. I can ignore what my local community association might want me to do. I might be involved in a volunteer group, and it might want members to conform to one thing or another. I have the choice as to whether I want to continue to be a part of that organization. However, none of us have the choice when it comes to government because, at the end of the day, government backs up all its decisions with that monopoly on the use of force. Citizens must comply. They must follow the law, or they will forcibly be punished for that refusal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565326">The same is true when it comes to taxation. At the end of the day, all the taxation measures that are passed here are built upon the bedrock that the government will send someone to arrest us if we do not pay our fair share of taxes. Therefore, when the government collects those tax dollars out of the pockets of the hard-working Canadians who earned it, the people who get up before the sun rises and come home after it has set, when the government reaches into their pockets after they have earned their pay through the toil, sweat and often blood that they expend to do their jobs, it had better have a darn good reason to take that money out of people's pockets. When the government takes all that money and collects it here in Ottawa and decides whom to give it to, it better darn well be for the reasons that were explained for taking the money in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565327">What we uncovered with the SDTC green slush fund scandal was abhorrent. It violated the fundamental basic premise of responsible government, which is the idea that the dollar that is taxed should go to the program that it was allocated for, and for the reasons that were explained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565328"> What we found out is that the government set up the fund and appointed the board of directors basically out of the ranks of Liberal supporters. The Liberal-friendly board of directors started to make decisions as to the allocation of that money to fund its own companies, to fund projects that the Auditor General found did not even have a single environmental benefit. The government went out and collected money from the hard-earned dollars of workers across the country. The officials said that they were going to take this money forcibly from us, but not to worry as they were going to spend it on all kinds of good things that would benefit the environment. However, instead, the officials were funnelling that cash to their friends, supporters and cronies. That is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565329">It took a great deal of work. I want to take this opportunity to thank the hard-working members of the committee, who are my colleagues sitting right here, who came in after hours for meetings on break weeks and during recesses to pore through those accounts, to force testimony from those officials who made those decisions and some of the beneficiaries of that graft. We exposed this slush fund for what it was, which was a way for the government to funnel tax dollars into the pockets of its partisan supporters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565330"> Do members remember when a certain someone said that sunlight was the best disinfectant? I am old enough to remember that. I remember that it was the mantra that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> got elected on. However, like so many things about the Prime Minister, it was not quite as advertised, was it? It has taken the tremendous effort of a parliamentary committee, and now a production order from the House itself, for the government to hand over the simple documentation as to who got paid. That should be the simplest thing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8565331">That should not even require a motion at committee; it should just be a normal matter that departments should follow of their own accord. They should proactively be disclosing this type of thing, or when a committee member asks for it, it should be provided, no questions asked. Only a government that had something to hide would go to such great lengths to keep it hidden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565332">Think about this: The government has forced the House to use precious time out of our legislative calendar to force the information from them. It could have resolved this right from day one. With the first hints that something was wrong, it could have immediately said that it was going to come clean, if it has nothing to hide, with all the documents, and save a bunch of committee time and House time. We could have gotten the documents, and we and all Canadians could have learned exactly what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565333">The very fact that to this day the government is still redacting pieces of paper and still refusing to hand over documents is so telling, and it is certainly not the action of someone who has nothing to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565334">I would like to quote for the House some interesting statements on the principle of disclosure, from a gentleman whose name is Paul MacKinnon and who I believe is related to the current <Affiliation DbId="310517" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation>. He sent an advisement up the chain of command. On September 15, 2021, in preparation for the current Parliament, he said, “in the event that parliamentarians press for the release of confidential information, the appropriate minister or ministers should take responsibility for the decision to provide or withhold the information.” That has not happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565335">He went on to say at a later date, “Consistent with the principles of responsible government, the ultimate accountability for deciding what information to withhold from or release to parliamentarians resides with the responsible minister. Public servants do not share in ministers' constitutional accountability to the Houses of Parliament”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565336"> It is the ministers themselves who have the requirement, so the ministers responsible for the departments that refuse to hand over the documents are, in effect, in contempt of Parliament. That is why our original motion called for that fact to be recognized and gave the government a very reasonable one-week deadline to provide the documents they already have in their possession. It is not the case that they have to go scouring through emails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565337">I should mention at this point that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278386" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565338">I just want to reinforce the point that the documents exist. We know they exist, because they were the subject of the Auditor General's audit. All we are asking for is that the government simply take the documents and provide them to the law clerk. The law clerk can then provide them to the RCMP. If, as we suspect, crimes were committed, we owe that to the Canadian taxpayers who were robbed of their hard-earned money, because the money did not go to what the government said it was going to go to; it went to Liberal-friendly firms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565339">I think about a board of directors' making a decision to allocate money to a company that they had a financial interest in, that they themselves owned. They were using taxpayers' money and funnelled it right into the companies that they owned and profited from. That is an egregious abuse of taxpayers' money. That is why the production order was so important. That is why it is such a contempt of the House that the government ignored it, and that is why all members of Parliament, if they pretend to believe in any sense of parliamentary accountability, should support the motion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8565353">Mr. Speaker, we are here this evening because the Liberal government has once again refused, through its many tentacles, to comply with a direct order of this Parliament to obtain very important information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565354">Let us talk about the Liberal green fund, the Liberal government's slush fund. A lot of public money, Canadians' money, went into this $1‑billion green fund. Remember the sponsorship scandal? Next to this Liberal green fund, that other Liberal scandal from a few years back looks like small potatoes. We are dealing with a situation where people deliberately ignored ethics rules. They deliberately ignored regulations in order to benefit themselves and their own companies. The people I am referring to are the directors of this green fund, which we call the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565355">I want to commend the exceptional work of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, who never gave up, who uncovered the scandal and who pushed past the initial refusals that we got in the beginning. First there were full-blown denials that there were any problems, and then the minister said that they had cleaned house and that everything was resolved. The matter might have ended there. Nothing would have been discovered. Case closed. If my colleague had not investigated further, we would not have had the devastating reports from the Auditor General and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, who lifted the veil and brought this Liberal green fund scandal into the light of day. The Liberal government and this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried to hide the extent of the corruption from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565356">I want to present a few facts. By the way, the directors of the green fund were obviously appointed by this Liberal government, probably to benefit the friends of the Liberal Party. That is our biggest concern. How much did people profit from this appointment to get rich to the detriment of Canadians and at the expense of Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565357">The Auditor General found that these Liberal-appointed officials were sending taxpayers' money to their own companies. The Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner found that the Prime Minister's hand-picked green slush fund chair had also broken the law. We thought she had broken it once or twice. The Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner recently appeared at a committee meeting that my colleague attended, where we learned that the former chair of the Liberal green fund had breached the ethics rules 24 times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565358">The Auditor General found that directors had awarded funding to projects that were not eligible. Proponents applied for funding for projects to improve our environment, but it turns out that these projects had absolutely nothing to do with the green fund's objectives. That did not stop the board of directors from voting to grant the money anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565359">According to the Auditor General, $123 million was awarded appropriately and $59 million was awarded to projects that should never have received money. That is not peanuts; that is hundreds of millions of dollars. The Auditor General found that over $330 million of taxpayers' money was paid out in more than 180 instances where there was a real or potential conflict of interest. Directors appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> paid money to companies that belonged to them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8565360">These directors decided to give funding and subsidies to businesses that they themselves owned. Is it not the most basic rule of ethics for a board member to recuse themselves from a decision from which they stand to benefit? They did not feel it was necessary to recuse themselves. When someone like that stays at the table, the main problem is that they can make sure that funding goes to their own business. When a board member in that position does not recuse themselves, then no one can raise a conflict of interest like they could if that board member were absent. Those board members stayed at the table and happily gave themselves millions of dollars. I am not the one saying it. This comes from the Auditor General of Canada and the Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565361">How can we expect these directors to follow the rules? There is a simple, basic principle that everyone has to follow the rules. Unfortunately, the example set at the top emboldens people to stop worrying about the consequences of breaking the rules. This example comes fomr the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, who was found guilty of violating ethics laws not once, but twice. Both times, he stood up in front of all the members of the House and said that he accepted responsibility for his actions and would suffer the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565362">Can anyone tell me what consequences the Prime Minister suffered for breaking the ethics rules twice? There were no consequences. The Prime Minister said he accepted responsibility and the matter ended there. Thank goodness for Conservative members like my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> who are staying vigilant and making sure that no ethics violation or case of corruption goes ignored or unpunished. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565363">Still, they pushed back hard. They refused to comply with the House's order to produce the documents that would enable us and the RCMP to determine whether, in addition to the ethical violations and conflicts of interest, any crimes had been committed. We would like all departments to hand over documents to the law clerk of the House so that we can determine whether crimes were committed in addition to all the other violations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565364">These documents have been provided only in part or not at all, or they have been redacted. Parliament has the right to receive these documents. Parliament has that authority. With the power to tax people comes the responsibility to ensure that the money is being well spent. That is why Parliament has the power to ask anyone it wants for documents and to get all the information. That way, Canadians can be sure that there is accountability for the money they agree to pay to their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565365">This is not the first time this government has balked at submitting to an order from Parliament. It has happened several times in the past. The most blatant case was that of the Winnipeg laboratory, when the government went so far as to call an election in the middle of a pandemic to avoid submitting to an order from Parliament. In the interest of settling the matter quickly, I am asking the government to hand over all the documents immediately; otherwise, we will go to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</ParaText>

Quite frankly, there is an abuse of the power of this place that is trampling on the charter-protected rights of Canadians. I would have liked to have thought that all members of the chamber, our hon. members, would like to live in a country where politicians do not use their extraordinary powers to bypass the judicial oversight that law enforcement requires to intrude on the charter rights of Canadians.</ParaText>

That does not follow important procedures for protecting the rights of Canadians under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8565451">Mr. Speaker, I am rising today at the hour of adjournment to pursue a question I asked May 2, the day the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> tabled Bill <Document DbId="13050012" Type="3">C-69</Document>. This is what is called, in the vernacular, an omnibus budget bill. Liberals will remember those words because it was in the platform of the Liberals that they would not introduce such things as omnibus budget bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565452">Liberals also promised that they would make sure that the legislation brought forward would have full consultation with indigenous peoples as required under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; that did not happen either. We also had a promise to improve environmental assessment. What I did on May 2 was refer to this as something of a hat trick. There were three different platform promises broken in one omnibus budget bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565453">The part that concerns me the most, although it is hard to say which is worse, is I think what we have had happen here is a gross violation of our responsibility as parliamentarians to respond to the challenges and the need to have environmental assessment legislation that works, to ensure that it is constitutionally valid and to ensure that it is studied in the appropriate committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565454">Let me try to point out one of the major reasons it is so deeply offensive that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> brought forward the changes being made to the environmental impact bill. This is a huge omnibus bill. There are over 40 different divisions, not to mention there are over 300 sections to the bill. We get to the environmental assessment bits by the time we get to division 28, part 6 and then we start realizing something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565455">This is what I think as an environmental lawyer and I have consulted some friends who do constitutional law. The Liberals may not have fixed the problem that the Supreme Court had because the way they have defined when something is in federal jurisdiction is to get rid of language they think the court did not like, which was language around things like “adverse effect”. They said an adverse effect, and throughout the bill it is the same every time, within federal jurisdiction is a “non-negligible” adverse change. That is repeated multiple times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565456">My point is we cannot come up with a conclusion that an effect is non-negligible before studying the project and having some idea what the impact is going to be. We cannot decide, ahead of time, that it is non-negligible. It is a tautology. It is hastily drafted. The court ruled that the last version violated the Constitution by having federal intrusions into provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565457">Here is the problem: The bill continues with what Stephen Harper did in wrecking environmental assessment in, yes again, omnibus budget Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> in spring 2012. This was a chance to fix it. The Liberals blew it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565463">Mr. Speaker, last October, the Supreme Court of Canada issued an opinion regarding the constitutionality of the Impact Assessment Act, stating that we needed to clearly focus on the areas of federal jurisdiction and underscoring that we work with provinces “in the spirit of cooperative federalism.” More specifically, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that decisions under the act must be tied exclusively to “adverse effects within federal jurisdiction” and that the definition of “effects within federal jurisdiction” must be clearly defined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565464">I am happy to say that last June, the Government of Canada delivered on its promise to quickly and meaningfully amend the Impact Assessment Act to respond to the Supreme Court of Canada and provide regulatory certainty for major project proponents, indigenous partners and Canada's investment climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565465">The amended act clearly focuses on preventing or mitigating effects in areas of federal responsibility. It also provides increased flexibility and new tools to harmonize the federal process with those of other jurisdictions and facilitate greater co-operation. As a result, it reduces duplication and increases efficiency and certainty with the goal of achieving “one project, one assessment”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565466"> The government is committed to ensuring that indigenous consultation is included in the work it does. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples remains integral to the Impact Assessment Act. As such, the act will continue to provide opportunities for meaningful engagement and the participation of indigenous peoples in the assessment process with the aim of securing their free, prior and informed consent, and ensuring their rights and interests are respected throughout the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565467">The government is committed to ensuring that future generations are able to live in a healthy environment, and that is exactly what it will continue to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565469">We had a system that worked. The expert panel on environmental assessment gave the government clear information on what to do. It chose not to do it. What that means is that right now a project clearly in federal jurisdiction could wipe out an endangered species. It would never hit a red flag. It would never hit a trigger. It would never get assessed, because we have abandoned the core principles we had for EA since 1993.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8565474">Mr. Speaker, my immediate reaction is that James should check his mail and look at the carbon rebate, but the Conservative Party seems to be obsessed with the idea of attacking the carbon pricing mechanism. Carbon pricing is a proven, effective method of reducing emissions in Canada. Whether someone lives in Toronto, in Manitoba, in Saskatchewan or in Nova Scotia, the fact remains that carbon pricing has been proven time and time again to be effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565475">Eight out of 10 Canadians receive more money back than they pay out. That is undisputed fact, and the Conservatives can continue to spout this rhetoric about how carbon pricing is making life more difficult for Canadians, when in fact the opposite is true. What carbon pricing is doing is protecting our environment, helping us reduce emissions and making life more affordable through the rebate, which is something they continually, over and over again, fail to talk about whenever they talk about carbon pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565476">The rhetoric has to stop. I am prepared to have a reasonable debate with this member or any member opposite about reducing emissions through carbon pricing and other processes we can introduce to make the system more fair and effective to help Canadians create an environment where we are living in a cleaner Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565479"> Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to be cute. This is a very serious issue. I live in Toronto. The price of gas at the pumps in Toronto is lower now than it was a year ago. It is about the same price as it was when carbon pricing was introduced a number of years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565480"> The notion that it costs more to get in the car and travel is pure fallacy. It is political rhetoric to score some political points to help the Conservatives win an election. If they want to have a debate about efficient, effective mechanisms to reduce carbon in our environment, I am here. I will talk to them in the House, I will talk to them out in the corridor and I will talk to them in my office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565481">However, until the Conservatives cut back on the rhetoric, I am not sure the conversation is going to be productive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565482">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565483">I rise today to speak about the ongoing drug addiction crisis and its terrible impacts on residents in my community of Kelowna—Lake Country and across Canada. Overdoses are up; overdose deaths are up and addictions are up. Since 2015, overdoses have increased 184%, and that is nearly 45,000 Canadians who have, sadly, lost their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565484">The radical NDP-Liberal so-called safe supply drug experiment has done nothing to stem the tide of overdose deaths. It has instead flooded our streets, playgrounds, public spaces and even hospitals with dangerous illicit drugs. We have heard from expert witnesses that diverted so-called safe supply drugs such as hydromorphone are being resold and trafficked into our communities and used as currency in exchange for fentanyl. This fuels the drug trade even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565485"> A report commissioned by B.C.'s top doctor actually said that the program was “almost as good as giving [drug users] cash.” I have talked to first responders in my community who are, frustratingly, seeing the effects of these policies on our streets. The Vancouver Police Department noted that around 50% of all hydromorphone seizures were diverted from government, taxpayer-funded, drugs. Over 30 criminal charges were just made following a raid at a so-called safe consumption site in Nanaimo. We have heard that drug diversion is specifically targeting children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565486"> We have already seen what happened when the federal <Affiliation DbId="300007" Type="4">addictions minister</Affiliation> approved an open drug use policy. The federal government has also approved an open drug use policy in public spaces, including parks and playgrounds. Open drug use in playgrounds normalizes exposure to deadly drugs to children and was a contributing factor for the reckless policy to be backtracked when it was repeatedly called out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565487">There was a drug paraphernalia vending machine in British Columbia, distributing crack pipes and syringes. Only after much massive public pressure during a provincial election did the NDP provincial government stop it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565488"> Unfortunately, the ideology-driven minister appears to show no signs of slowing down from implementing radical policies. In July, a memo to the <Affiliation DbId="300007" Type="4">Minister of Mental Health and Addictions</Affiliation> was obtained through an access to information request. The memo advised the government to “use all tools” at its disposal to address the crisis, including using national drug decriminalization. This means that the Liberal government is considering the legalization of hard drugs, like crack, meth and fentanyl, across the whole country. This reckless expansion cannot happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565489"> We continue to see the disastrous results of the NDP-Liberal drug policies in British Columbia. Recently on Vancouver Island, a tribal council representing 14 first nations declared a state of emergency over the ongoing opioid crisis. In British Columbia, drug overdoses have become the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 10 and 18. This is absolutely heartbreaking. We cannot afford to continue with these Liberal policies, nor can we afford to entertain the expansion of deadly programs that are flooding our neighbourhoods with drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565490"> The taxpayer funding of dangerous drugs must end now. Therefore, common-sense Conservatives will end the failed NDP-Liberal drug experiment for good. We will instead bring hope and healing through addiction treatment and recovery to bring our loved ones home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8565491">Mr. Speaker, the toxic drug and overdose crisis continues to have an impact on Canadians from coast to coast. People are losing their lives to the ever-changing illegal toxic drug supply. Many are dying because of it, but these are preventable deaths. We need to use everything at our disposal to save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565492"> This crisis is complex, and we need to work with all orders of government, partners and stakeholders. We need to listen to our partners and do everything we can to save lives, improve access to health care services and maintain safe communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565493">A strict law enforcement-only approach, with no acknowledgement that this is a public health crisis, drove Canada's response to substance use for over a century. Time and again, this has been proven to be ineffective. We hold it to Canadians to work towards solutions. Canadians suffering from addictions need health care, not jail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565494">This government's commitment to working with all orders of government to find local solutions is unwavering. Working in partnership is what responsible governments do. However, screaming slogans into the void is the only solution Conservatives offer. They like to talk about crimes and disorder, but the actual experts in law enforcement do not agree with them. They have been clear in their support of a comprehensive public health approach to addressing substance use harms. Police are looking for better ways to address community concerns around safety in public spaces, rather than arresting someone for a health care issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8565495">Cities across Canada are witnessing the compounding effects of the ongoing overdose crisis, with people managing mental health issues, the impacts of the housing shortage and the need for more affordable housing. If the Conservatives cared that much about public drug use, they would not oppose safe consumption sites. When these sites do not exist, the streets and our public spaces become consumption spaces. </ParaText>

It requires a comprehensive response with innovative actions to save more lives, and we are closely monitoring those actions so we can make adjustments along the way. We are working to ensure that Canadians have access to a full range of prevention, risk reduction, treatment and recovery services, as well as the support they need, when and where they need it, while also keeping communities safe. For example, budget 2024 announced a new commitment of $150 million for a fund to support municipalities and indigenous communities. This funding will help provide rapid responses to more heavily affected communities with urgent and critical needs related to the overdose crisis. This is in addition to the billions of dollars we have already committed to combat this crisis.</ParaText>

This is no wonder, given that B.C., sadly, saw a 400% increase in drug overdose deaths in the first year of the decriminalization experiment. Many of our residential neighbourhoods, where children used to be able to play and seniors used to be able to walk safely, as well as business areas with small businesses, have been taken over by crime and people openly suffering from addiction. </ParaText>
