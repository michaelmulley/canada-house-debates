              <ParaText id="8755525">Madam Speaker, I move that the 10th report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, presented on Monday, October 30, 2023, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755526">It is always an honour to rise in this place, and today's matter is about transparency and common-sense ideas. This report contains a few common-sense recommendations that, unfortunately, the Liberal government and its radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> have simply chosen to ignore. Members should make no mistake: There has never been a more ideologically driven Minister of Environment than the one we have today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755527">Even if we set aside the previous arrests and the utter disdain for Canada's energy sector, I truly believe that, at some point in the not too distant future, we will all come to realize that we have never had such an incompetent and ineffective <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> for Canada. Not only have Canada's climate outcomes failed to improve, but Canada's performance is also the worst in the G7, despite claims that the government may make all the time. The minister has imposed a crippling carbon tax that punishes seniors trying to heat their homes during our cold winters. I can tell members that the rumours are true: It does get cold in Manitoba. Seniors deserve to have heat and quality of life. The minister targets moms and dads who are struggling to fill their tanks to take their kids to school, to hockey practice, to soccer practice, to music lessons or anything else, if they can still afford to put their kids in such important programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755528">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has done more damage to Canada's economy than almost any other minister of the Crown in our nation's history. He has forced us to pay for his carbon tax, and for what? The Liberals may not want to admit it, at least publicly, but they are nowhere near meeting their emissions targets. Simply put, they are failing because their climate plan was never about the climate; it was always about taxes. Their carbon tax is a major contributor to the inflation that is driving up the cost of everything. This is causing millions of Canadians to visit food banks every year just to put something in their stomachs; they do not know where their next meal is going to come from. In Canada, we now have a resurgence of scurvy because people cannot afford enough fruits and vegetables. This is insane and embarrassing. The fact that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s legacy will be a country where people cannot buy enough nutritious food to keep them healthy is something that I imagine he will be very ashamed of when his tenure comes to an end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755529"> While Canadians are being forced to pay for the Liberal carbon tax, most people I talk to recognize that, sadly, we are in a cost of living crisis. We are threatened by tariffs from our largest trading partner; our GDP per capita is declining steadily. Millions of Canadians are just $200 away from insolvency, and household debt has reached new record highs. The vast majority of young people that I talk to cannot afford to buy a home; frankly, they have lost all hope and given up the idea of even trying to ever have that happen in their lives. Meanwhile, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is on a mission, for some strange reason, to continue down this path of quadrupling the carbon tax and, if given the chance, probably more. He gave a very unclear answer at our environment committee just last week, and he still thinks everything is fine. It is not fine for millions of people in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755530"> I have never met anyone more out of touch, more disconnected from the realities faced by Canadian families, students, seniors and everybody else. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has no understanding of the pain and suffering that he is causing right now, and it certainly does not appear that he even cares about it. He thinks we should all just shut up and pay his carbon tax because he knows what is best for people. He has lost the plot. He has climbed so far up his ivory tower that he has lost all sense of reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755531">I will also mention that I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278380" Type="2">Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755532">This brings me to the second recommendation within the report, one that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> surely did not read. This recommendation is that the government must direct its incentives to technologies that actually reduce emissions, and what a reasonable idea that is. Thank goodness for the commissioner of the environment, who has put a glaring spotlight on the Liberals' net-zero accelerator initiative. It is as though the Liberal ministers are playing poker: “I see the green slush fund, and I raise a net-zero accelerator fund.” It is an $8-billion Liberal boondoggle in the making. Eight billion dollars is handed over to large multinational corporations while the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> taxes seniors, students, families and anybody else whose pockets he can get his hands into.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8755533">The findings of the environment commissioner's report regarding the $8-billion initiative are terrifying, to say the least. This program, touted as one of the cornerstones of the Liberal government's climate efforts, has been nothing but a complete failure. The Liberals have mismanaged this fund to the point of negligence, as they have done with many other things they have gotten their hands on. The department failed to track whether the initiative was delivering real value for money and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using value-for-money audits is a reasonable idea. The Liberal government has failed to do that. Simply put, taxpayers have no idea whether their hard-earned tax dollars are going to reduce emissions, as the government claims they are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755534">Let us talk numbers. The report shows that five corporations made a commitment to reduce emissions in their contracts, and the cost to taxpayers to reduce just one tonne of greenhouse gases was $143. That might sound like a lot, but it gets much worse. For the other 12 projects, funded with that same $8 billion, there are no signed commitments to reduce emissions whatsoever; the commissioner's audit found that, because these projects did not have any signed commitments, the overall cost is $523 per tonne of emissions reduced under this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755535">The Liberals, as they always do, promised results; once again, they failed to deliver on yet another promise. They have just simply delivered another wasteful program. It is not one that can measure results. That is not how to develop a program for anything. They have squandered billions of dollars with no real targets, no clear outcomes and no clear plans on how to achieve anything. This is not a climate action plan; it is a taxpayer-funded boondoggle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755536">The environment committee did the responsible thing and passed a motion demanding full access to the contracts the Liberals signed with these massive corporations. The common-sense Conservative team led the charge because we believe taxpayers should know where their money is being spent and whether it is being spent in a useful manner. However, here is the kicker: The Liberals completely disregarded the committee's motion, stonewalling us for months. Once they did hand over the documents, kind of, they pulled out hundreds that we simply could not see and redacted so much that it made them largely irrelevant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755537">They simply do not want members of Parliament or Canadians to know where the $8 billion is going. They do not want us to know how many jobs may or may not be maintained or ever created. They do not want us to know by how much emissions will be reduced through spending on any of these programs. It is ridiculous, to say the least. It is insane how far the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> will go to hide the truth. Exhibit A is the ongoing green slush fund debate in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755538">They do not care about outcomes. They care about announcements, press releases and press conferences. They care about being seen to be doing something but not about actually doing anything. It is virtue signalling on the taxpayer's dime. It is lazy environmental policy, and it is simply no way to run a government. They are failing miserably. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755539">Members of Parliament simply need to see how these tax dollars are being spent. We deserve to know whether the net-zero accelerator is accomplishing its stated goals. While the Liberal MPs on the committee gave every lame excuse they could not to learn the truth, it was the Conservatives that got them to vote in favour of the motion we passed at committee. The motion partly reads:</ParaText>

They refuse to abide by this motion, and today is just the beginning of the Conservatives' mission to discover how rotten this net-zero accelerator fund truly is. We deserve to know results because Canadians deserve to know results. We represent the people who pay their taxes to fund these sorts of programs, and it is ridiculous that the Liberals are continuing to try to hide the truth. The environment committee has much more work to do in order to get to the bottom of this boondoggle and find solutions that can actually deliver results for taxpayers; Canadians deserve nothing less. </ParaText>

Right now, emissions in Canada are at the lowest they have been in almost three decades, and that is actually verified by independent reports.

In terms of carbon capture and storage, yes, it seems like a promising lead and a way to actually reduce emissions.

I was fortunate to work on the committee's 10th report on clean technologies. The report proved that technology, not taxes, should be the foundation of an environment policy.

              <ParaText id="8755561">The ranking is four places lower than it was two years ago, despite multiple carbon tax hikes on Canadians. With such an embarrassing ranking, it is no wonder the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> is trying to discredit the report by saying it is some random international assessment that does not reflect Canada's policies and reality. No, it is a report that does not reflect his imaginary fantasy that he wants it to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755562">Unsurprisingly, dozens of countries around the world that do not punish their people with a carbon tax are significantly outperforming Canada on the environmental index. This is why I asked the independent environment commissioner whether Canada could achieve its targets without a carbon tax. He said yes. For nine years, the Liberals falsely claimed that the carbon tax was the only way to meet their environmental targets. They were once again proven wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755563">It is for these reasons that Canadians are rejecting the failed so-called environmental policies of the government. Canadians understand that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> are inflicting a lot of economic pain with no environmental gain.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755565">Most Canadians tuning in have probably never heard of the government's $8-billion net zero accelerator fund. I find this surprising for three reasons. First, Canadian taxpayers are literally being charged $8 billion for the program. Second, the government usually brags about how much money it is spending. Third, the Liberals claim the $8-billion net zero accelerator would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Instead the Liberals have gone incognito on their $8-billion net zero accelerator fund. I wonder why that is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755569">I agree with the Bloc member. It is more than embarrassing, though; it is corrupt. I can guarantee that Canadians want to know why they are paying $8 billion for the failed and fraudulent slush fund. Conservatives on the environment committee called on Liberals to release the funding details of their $8-billion net zero accelerator fund to the public, but the government refused. This is why the environment committee ordered the government to hand over all contracts to the committee so we could find out the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755570">Instead of handing over the contract to parliamentarians, the Liberals locked the contracts in a room and put a gag order on every MP who viewed them. Any MP who read the eight billion dollars' worth of contracts was forced to lock up their phone and not take any notes, and was prevented from discussing what they saw. I was one of those MPs, and I understand why the Liberals have gagged me. I was absolutely shocked by what I saw.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755571">As I said, the government has placed me and all the members of the environment committee under a gag order to prevent us from disclosing the truth. Over 65 pages of net zero accelerator contracts were redacted and over 360 pages were completely ripped out of the contracts. Someone in the Liberal government ordered over 360 pages of the net zero accelerator contracts to be ripped out to prevent parliamentarians from seeing what $8 billion was spent on. This sounds borderline criminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755572">Did the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> order it to be done? Did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> order it to be done? Who ripped out the pages of the net zero accelerator contracts to hide the truth? Who poured black ink on the contracts to cover up the lines? Who will be accountable for the $8-billion scam?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755573">The Liberal government defied the will of Parliament by failing to hand over the contracts of its $8-billion net zero accelerator funds. It is very clear it is hiding something. The environment commissioner caught the Liberals giving away billions of tax dollars to large multinational companies without any commitment to reduce emissions. This could very well be the government's most expensive scandal yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755574">If the NDP were truly opposed to corporate handouts, its members would be outraged. If the Bloc truly cared about the environment, its members would be outraged. If any member of Parliament cared about accountability, they would be outraged. I can promise that Canadians are outraged. Canadians deserve answers on the Liberal government's fake, failed and fraudulent $8-billion net zero accelerator fund. They deserve to know what companies received eight billion dollars' worth of taxpayers' money and what the money was spent on.</ParaText>

When the Conservatives bring in a concurrence report, they also bring in amendments to it. The amendments are instructions. What they are doing is sending the reports back to standing committees. In some cases, they are asking us to call other individuals to come before committee to answer questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755618">Madam Speaker, what is really difficult, when the Conservatives want to talk about the environment, is that we have now had two speakers stand up to try to play down the importance of the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755619"> It is really quite unfortunate because it is not only on the floor of the House of Commons that they spread misinformation, but also, sadly, through social media, in particular, and emails. In all likelihood, they send out literally millions of emails. I am one of the recipients of their emails, and they are so misleading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755620"> Let us talk about the price on pollution. There are two components: the rebate portion and the tax portion. It has been well established that over 80% of Canadians receive more money back than they pay for a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755621"> Canada is not the only jurisdiction in the world that uses a price on pollution. There are even some American states that use a price on pollution. The arguments that the Conservatives use, depending on the day, do not hold water. They are like a strainer. At the end of the day, what we are seeing is a Conservative Party that is more concerned with trying to give a false impression than truly caring about our environment, and ultimately, taxation and supporting Canadians by increasing their disposable income. I will expand on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755622"> First and foremost, every member of the Conservative caucus, with the exception of those who were elected in a by-election, campaigned on a price on pollution, including the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. Then they changed their position, and it is not the first or the second time that they have changed their position. They changed their position with the current leader, who made the initial flip-flop, so they now oppose it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755623">When the Conservatives say that they oppose it, they are trying to give the impression that the rebate is less than the tax, which is not true for over 80% of the people who receive the backstop. If we take a look at it, we will find that it is having a positive impact in our communities. That is why we even have some provincial jurisdictions that have their own programs. They realize that putting a price on pollution is an effective way of dealing with emissions, amongst other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755624"> I would suggest that it is not unique to see the Conservatives flip-flopping and completely disregarding their election platform. Members can remember that last week, we had a vote on an actual tax break, a GST holiday for Canadians. Every one of the Conservatives voted against it, yet every one of them campaigned in favour of a GST holiday break in the last federal election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755625"> What does that say about the Conservative platform, those major policy announcements that come out during an election, such as the Conservatives saying that they were in support of a price on pollution and giving a tax break with a GST holiday, when it comes down to voting, that they actually vote against them? They voted against a price on pollution, and they voted against a GST tax break for the holiday season. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8755626">The irony of it all is that we have Conservatives going across the country saying they are going to axe the tax. Let us look at what they are telling Canadians and what they are doing. In Winnipeg North, the Conservatives would get rid of the carbon rebate. That would mean a whole lot of money would be coming out of the pockets of at least 80% of the constituents I represent. Plus, when we factor in the rebate compared to the tax the Conservatives say they would be axing, it means the disposable income based on the election commitment under that <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> would see less disposable income because of their so-called axe the tax. That is not a net gain for 80% of the constituents I represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755627">The Conservatives do not have a problem with misleading Canadians. They are telling people that they are going to be better off because of their proposal, when they know for a fact that is not the case. They know that, and then, when it comes time to do something to provide tax relief for Canadians, again, the Conservatives are doubling down. They are voting against one other issue that they said that they would give to Canadians, a GST holiday during the season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755628"> It makes no sense unless, of course, we listen to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and think of his ambitions. That is why there was a very interesting article that made the national news last week. It talked about a lot of the Conservatives on the inside. Members of Parliament were concerned about the leadership of the Conservative Party, and I can appreciate why. They went to the doors and said, “We are going to give a tax holiday during the holiday season”, and now they are being forced to vote against the tax holiday for the Christmas season. The Conservatives went to the doors in the last election and said, “I support a price on pollution”, and now they are voting against the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755629"> It is not like Conservative members were given a choice. They were told to bring this forward. It is interesting that it was two Manitoba members of Parliament who brought forward this motion. In the last budget, or I think it was the previous one, we saw a major commitment to the province of Manitoba. Canada's national Water Agency will be located in Manitoba's capital city of Winnipeg. The premier, the mayor and many different stakeholders are very happy to see a national government that recognizes the importance of having a water strategy, and that the national office will be located in the city of Winnipeg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755630">When I talk about the environment, and the many things that are taking place, I could provide a list of things I have noted, whether they are the banning of single-use plastics, making zero-emission vehicles more affordable, the serious cut on emissions or the expansion of 44 national wildlife areas and three national parks. Canada's emissions are tracking downward, which is so encouraging to see. There are so many things, such as the greener homes program.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755665">Madam Speaker, the member's speech was kind of all over the place, but at the heart of it, we are supposed to be debating technological solutions to the climate crisis. One of the favourite solutions the Conservatives and Liberals like to put forward is carbon capture, utilization and storage, CCUS, despite the fact that long-term data from the United States and statements from the IPCC say this does not work and is the most inefficient, expensive way to tackle the climate crisis. The government still considers it a climate-friendly solution and proposes billions of dollars in subsidies to oil companies that make billions of dollars in profits and should be paying for these solutions themselves. </ParaText>

This phrase is recognized the world over, except here in Canada. The legislation that was passed in the spring is called the “Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act”. However, the internationally recognized phrase is “just transition”, so that is what we should really be focusing on. What is a just transition? It is a concept rooted in social justice, the idea being that the transition needs to be just to ensure that workers affected by the necessary shift away from oil and gas will not have to bear the full brunt of this transition. They must receive all the help they need to train for new jobs in other sectors.</ParaText>

When asked about the Trump administration's intentions with regard to developing the clean technology sector, executives from Quebec's renewable energy sector stated that the economic spinoffs that the clean energy sector generates for the U.S. economy are far too significant for Trump to risk jeopardizing them. According to the head of Boralex, the Trump administration would be at risk of losing factories, jobs, and tax and export revenues if it scraps the Inflation Reduction Act. As a result, Trump's election is unlikely to impede the growth of the clean energy sector, so we should not let ourselves get too carried away.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755689">However, I must emphasize that the people who are affected must also have a say in decisions that will have a bearing on their future. In Quebec, social licence is key, and the Alliance de l'énergie de l'Est is an example of this. Two of the alliance's new projects, totalling nearly 500 megawatts, were approved by Hydro-Québec in late January. The alliance represents 209 communities from the Montmagny RCM to the Magdalen Islands. It emphasizes social licence and maximizing economic spinoffs. As for Quebec jobs, the Commission des partenaires du marché du travail, a board of labour market partners that was created over 20 years ago, prioritizes balance and worker participation. There are committees in every region that help identify needs. There are committees where employers, worker representatives and organizations in this field collaborate with the Quebec departments of labour and education. Is this not a fine example?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755690">We need skilled workers, yes, but training them is Quebec's role. This brings me to recommendation 16: “That the Government of Canada collaborate with provinces and territories to invest more in skills training, including skills upgrading and requalification programs”. We have certain reservations about this recommendation, namely whether it can be implemented while respecting jurisdictional boundaries and the cutting-edge initiatives Quebec has already rolled out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755691">Let us consider a non-Quebec example. One tangible risk for investment in the clean energy sector is Alberta's moratorium on renewable energy. From Canada's standpoint, Alberta's seven-month moratorium on renewable energy projects and the dozens of projects that have been cancelled as a result have discouraged investors in this sector. While Alberta is hitting the brakes on clean energy development, other provinces are forging ahead and developing their renewable energy production capabilities. In Quebec, clean technology development is already well under way. To help Quebec decarbonize, Hydro‑Québec is counting on renewable energy sources to deliver more energy capacity. It plans to add 10,000 megawatts of new wind capacity to its grid by 2035.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755692">As for coordination among different levels of government and recommendation 8, which reads, “That the Government of Canada coordinate energy retrofit programs with provincial programs to facilitate access to Canadians”, Quebec introduced a number of energy efficiency programs years ago, including EcoPerformance, Roulez vert, Technoclimat and Éconologis. In terms of collaboration, there is no problem. Quebec has proven that it is open to coordinating its provincial programs with federal ones, such as the Quebec government's Rénoclimat program and Ottawa's Canada Greener Homes Loan program, both of which deal with energy efficiency retrofits.</ParaText>

That is what Professor Mousseau was saying this morning. I do not think that Professor Mousseau is particularly partisan. He is the scientific director of the Institut de l'énergie Trottier, a top expert on energy matters. This is the typical dynamic when the federal government is dealing with the energy file. Why are opinions so polarized? It is because Canada is under the thumb of the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755713">As proof, consider the Trans Mountain fiasco. Let me make an evocative comparison. The Parliamentary Budget Officer told the Standing Committee on Natural Resources that we put $4.6 billion into Trans Mountain that we will never get back. The government will never get that money back. It threw $4.6 billion out the window, and the project itself cost $34 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755714">Let me remind members that the federal government announced in 2023 that its ambitious plan to electrify and decarbonize the Canadian economy would cost $40 billion, yet a single fossil fuel project cost $34 billion. The most ambitious plan in the history of government, according to our Liberal colleagues, was going to cost $40 billion. That is just awful. This comparison shows how awful it is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755715">Why should anyone consider investing in clean technologies when the federal government is basically saying that, if we want the pipeline to be profitable, we will have to be slaves to oil for the next 40 years? Not only that, but if we want the pipeline to be profitable, we need to pick up the pace and produce even more barrels of oil. According to the figures provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, that is totally inconsistent. According to the IPCC, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we need to reduce our oil consumption by 62%. Moreover, if we do not have a carbon capture and sequestration strategy, which is a mere pipe dream, as I will demonstrate later, we will have to reduce our fossil fuel consumption by 70%. That is if we want to stick to a 1.5-degree-Celsius increase in global temperatures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755716">What we are doing, however, is investing $34 billion in infrastructure so as to maximize oil consumption. If that is not inconsistent, then I honestly do not know what is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755717">I will get back to this insanity now. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, if we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we have to reduce our oil consumption by 62%, and that is with with carbon capture and sequestration strategies. Speaking of this carbon capture and sequestration nonsense, not too long ago Suncor CEO Rich Kruger came out and said, “We have a bit of a disproportionate emphasis on the longer-term energy transition”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755718">Suncor's Rich Kruger wondered why so much energy had to be dedicated to these new technologies. He said that the focus should instead be on the commercial interest, the oil sands. We do not have to agree with him, but at least he was being frank. This is indicative of what we see in the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755719">Oil companies know full well that carbon capture and sequestration strategies cost a fortune and that the pipe dream of producing net-zero oil makes about as much sense as making diet poutine. It will never happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755722">Business people are no dummies. What these big oil companies are saying is that Ottawa should be assuming the risks. If we want low-carbon oil, it will not be the greedy oil and gas sector that will take on the risks, it will be the federal government. Taxpayers are the ones who will have to assume the risks on behalf of the oil companies, which have been raking in record profits since the end of the pandemic. It that is not indecent, I do not know what is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755723"> What we know about carbon capture and sequestration strategies is that their effectiveness remains unproven. However, there is a consortium of corporations known as the Pathways Alliance. Many have probably heard of it already. It is a consortium comprising all the big oil companies. In fact, in a moment of rare lucidity the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> said that these people were harmful and served no purpose. For once, I had to agree with the leader of the official opposition. I hope he keeps repeating that message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755724">The Pathways Alliance is an oil consortium that was investigated by the Competition Bureau for false advertising. It even had to remove from its website statements claiming that it was able to make the oil sands carbon neutral. The Pathways Alliance, whose greenwashing practices were revealed in 2024 and which was forced to remove false statements from its website, wants almost $16 billion in funding from the federal government for carbon capture and sequestration projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755725">The government would bear the costs. The <Affiliation DbId="299995" Type="4">Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced their intention to reach an agreement with the consortium by 2024 through the Canada growth fund, or CGF. The CGF falls outside Ottawa's accounting purview. We have no control over it. The Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor General can do nothing. In addition to the CGF, the government would use tax credits available only to oil-producing provinces to achieve its goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755726">In my opinion, this amounts to throwing public funds out the window. There are, however, interesting critical minerals initiatives. I am thinking in particular about phosphate. The government agreed to put phosphate on the list of critical minerals, but without the associated tax credits. What is the point? I will not even mention hydrogen. The federal government was forced to lower its projections on hydrogen by 80%.</ParaText>

They are looking to the House and to every member here and asking us, “Please, do not steal our futures.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755746">We are facing a climate emergency. Every scientific report underscores this truth and we have a rapidly closing window to act. Unfortunately, what we have seen from the Liberal government, and the Conservative government before it, are missed targets, empty promises and actions that prioritize the profits of rich CEOs of wealthy oil and gas companies over the survival of our planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755747">I want to talk a bit about the Conservatives because they cannot even agree if climate change is real. They claim to care about affordability while denying the climate crisis itself. While they oppose measures to reduce emissions, they also oppose affordability measures. They continue to vote against ensuring low- and middle-income families could access heat pumps to bring down their energy bills, against GST breaks. They also offer no credible plan to address the rising costs of climate disasters. Hurricanes, floods and droughts are not abstract threats or things that are going to happen sometime in the future. They are happening here and now and are impacting communities from coast to coast to coast. Conservative denial and inaction leaves Canadians to pay the price, both in dollars and in lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755748">The Liberals seem to want to be Conservative lite. They acknowledge the climate crisis is real, but their actions fall woefully short of what is needed to address the climate crisis. They say they are climate leaders, but Canada is ranked 62 out of 67 on the climate change performance index. I will let that sink in: 62 out of 67. We are in the bottom tier. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> keeps saying it is okay because we are on track to meet our 2030 targets, but his own watchdog, the environment commissioner, has come to committee and said time and time again and has made it very clear that we are not on track.</ParaText>

These are the same companies that are raking in record profits even as the UN Secretary-General calls fossil fuel expansion “moral and economic madness.” How can the Liberals justify the billions of dollars they continue to hand to big oil and gas companies in public financing for fossil fuels while they claim to fight for a net-zero future?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755750">The commissioner of the environment's reports also have laid bare the consequences of Liberal mismanagement. The net-zero accelerator initiative the Liberals have touted as a key pillar of Canada's climate strategy is a cautionary tale of inefficiency. Only two of the 55 largest industrial emitters in Canada have committed to the goals. The average cost to taxpayers for each ton of emissions reduced by the net-zero accelerator is as high as $523. This is not the pathway to a climate-safe future. Critical accountability mechanisms need to be involved in every climate solution we put forward. Unfortunately, the government continues to show it is not a climate leader. This is failure by design.</ParaText>

These communities are not just victims of the climate crisis. They are also leaders in the solutions that we need. Renewable energy projects, conservation initiatives, sustainable agriculture, and indigenous and local knowledge must be at the heart of our climate response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755752">What should we be doing? The solutions are clear. They are within our grasp. Let us stop handing out billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil and gas companies that are fuelling the climate crisis. Let us redirect those funds into workers and into the clean economy. Let us implement an excess profits tax and invest that money in retrofitting homes, bringing down home heating costs, expanding public transit and creating good, family-sustaining jobs in the low-carbon economy. This will make life more affordable and curb the pollution that is driving up emissions.</ParaText>

It calls for leaders who will stop pretending they are on track, stop listening to oil and gas CEOs, and start listening to Canadians, to science and to their own environment commissioner.

              <ParaText id="8755765"> Madam Speaker, this is an important question right now. We saw that, under Biden, we had the Inflation Reduction Act, something bold, something that really highlighted how ineffective Canada's climate policies have been and how we really need to step up. However, now, we are facing a whole new context where a Trump presidency means probably the undermining of climate policy in the United States and potentially around the world. It is even more important right now for Canada to put forward bold climate solutions and to steer away from those climate solutions we know are unproven, risky and expensive, things like carbon capture and storage, which this government continues to funnel billions of taxpayer money into. Profitable oil and gas companies could be funding that themselves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755766">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to follow my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. She has a very powerful voice when it comes to climate change and Canada's role in addressing that reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755767">I could not agree with her more about how the Conservatives are denying the very existence of climate change. I will come back to that in a few moments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755768">When the Conservatives were in office, they simply denied the existence of climate change, which was irresponsible. As we will see later on, the result is that people have died and communities have disappeared because of the Conservatives' irresponsibility. Then, the Liberals took office. They are well aware that climate change exists, but they have done little or nothing to combat it. The whole climate change file has been a disaster for the past 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755769">However, there has been no shortage of resources. The Harper government and the current government provided a combined $1 trillion to boost the cash flow of Canada's big banks in order to sweeten their profits, executive bonuses and dividends. Together, both governments doled out $1 trillion. They also let a total $500 billion go to tax havens. The Conservatives set that up and the Liberals kept it going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755770">As my colleague just said, the two governments combined have paid out a total of $100 billion in subsidies to oil company executives. The Liberals, in a panic, set up a form of funding to finance Trans Mountain when the private sector refused to have anything to do with it. That cost us $35 billion. It took 24 hours for the Liberals to decide to invest $35 billion in a pipeline construction project that would never turn a profit, as we know all too well. The Parliamentary Budget Officer clearly said that it would never make a profit. Moreover, the environmental impacts are well known.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755771">For the past 20 years, neither party has taken the environment and climate change seriously, and there is no doubt we are now seeing the result of that. Their policies have had real consequences. In a moment, I will talk about the repercussions in my province, British Columbia, but we have seen repercussions across Canada. Forestry communities are in crisis. There have been record-breaking numbers of forest fires. There have been floods across the country. There have been intense heat waves. There have been all kinds of weather-related crises, many of which catch people off guard. The Conservatives deny that it is real. The Liberals say it is real, but they do not want to do anything about it.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8755772"> What is the reality when we see 20 years of complete inaction on the environment and climate change, yet there are massive subsidies for other things? Between the Liberals and the Conservatives together, $1 trillion was given in liquidity supports to Canada's big banks, half a trillion dollars was given to overseas tax savings, and $100 billion was given to oil and gas CEOs to subsidize what are massive profits to begin with. Of course, the Liberals are aware of this. There was $35 billion given, with a 24-hour turnaround, when they realized the private sector was bowing out of Trans Mountain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755773"> That is the reality of what we have seen over the last 20 years. That is why so many people are saying it is time to push aside the Liberals and the Conservatives and elect a government that actually understands the importance of taking action on climate change and the opportunity that comes from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755774">The reality is that the Joe Biden administration in the United States has put in place infrastructure that we have seen for clean energy across the U.S. Those investments have made a huge difference. A number of American cities and states are asking for clean energy, and if Canada actually stepped up, the market and the job creation coming from that would be enormous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755775"> We have not seen that imagination and foresight from either Conservatives, who are climate change deniers, or the Liberal government, which pays lip service to climate change. It does nothing to actually put in place the infrastructure that would lead to those substantial investments and the kinds of clean energy jobs of tomorrow that we want to see. We know what the opposite impacts are. Canada could lead the world in clean energy investments. We have virtually unlimited ability and capacity, when we talk about climate change and combatting it with clean energy investments in wind, solar and tidal, as well as unlimited potential for clean energy production. However, the Liberals have not stepped forward to put in place the infrastructure or to make those investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755776"> We have seen the opposite impacts, and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> spoke very eloquently about this. When the heat dome hit in my region of British Columbia, when it descended on the Lower Mainland, what happened was an incredible overloading of our emergency services. Firefighters and ambulance paramedics will tell us about how they simply were not able to keep up with the emergency demands over those days. Therefore, people slowly succumbed in low-level apartments that did not have air conditioning and that were not equipped for the size and scope of the heat dome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755777"> Emergency services were so overwhelmed that the system was at the point of breaking. Fortunately, this time, the heat dome finally broke. The result was that over 600 residents of the Lower Mainland died in that tragedy. In my riding of New Westminster—Burnaby, seniors, people with disabilities and shut-ins died quietly because of the intense heat. This happened particularly on the west side of New Westminster, where there are a lot of older low-rise apartments with no access to air conditioning. Dozens died in my riding. Hundreds died across the Lower Mainland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755778">Members will recall as well that we have seen a number of communities. I spoke about forest fires and the impacts. We have seen entire communities simply disappear in North America because of the climate crisis. We are seeing record levels of flooding, and in British Columbia, just in the last few years, we have had two atmospheric rivers and such torrential rains that we have been cut off from the rest of Canada. These tragedies are all preventable if we take action to combat climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755779">Younger Canadians see the impacts and see successive governments, Conservative and Liberal, that do little to nothing to actually combat the climate crisis, to prepare us for what is to come, to mitigate the impacts of climate change or to ensure that Canada and communities are protected. Seniors, shut-ins and people with disabilities are in apartments that are not built for the profound impacts of climate change. We must put in place measures so that, when a heat dome comes again, they can actually survive such a tremendous, terrible impact. It is a question of when, not if. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755780">We have had successive governments, both Conservative and Liberal, that have done nothing as we have become more and more aware of climate change. What members are hearing from the New Democrats today is that New Democrats believe in making those investments, combatting climate change and fighting that fight as if we intend to win it.</ParaText>

For decades, in every election, they promised to put dental care in place. They always have great plans at election time; once the election is over, they simply tear up their platform. Their platform was very good, but they never implemented it. That is the problem; that is the difference.

I would suggest that Conservative MPs actually talk to their constituents, particularly younger constituents, because they certainly understand the impacts of climate change. They want to see action.

              <ParaText id="8755799">Nine years ago, under the Conservative Party, Canada used to be one of the worst performers. Organizations such as Climate Action Tracker now recognize that Canada's plan is credible and transparent. The latest UNEP gap report says that Canada has the first comprehensive road map for how to achieve the 2030 target. This was unthinkable nine years ago. Our government has put forward very ambitious measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755800">International groups have noted that, at the end of 2022, Canada followed through on our commitment to end international public finance for fossil fuels; in addition, we have put forward some of the most ambitious regulations, with the goal of reducing oil and gas methane emissions by at least 75% from 2012 levels by 2030. Building on the actions of millions of Canadians, our government continues to take action to reduce emissions and to fight climate change while strengthening our economy with good jobs and clean industrial growth, making a healthy environment for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755801">First, let us talk about progress. According to the Canadian Climate Institute, since 2005, Canada's emissions have dropped by 8%. Canada's emissions are at their lowest point in 25 years, and we are on track to meet our 2026 interim goal and our 2030 goal. At the same time, our economy is growing, inflation and interest rates are all coming down, and we continue to put forward some of the most ambitious climate regulations in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755802">We are capping pollution, not production, for the oil and gas sector, which is a critical step toward fighting climate change while requiring investments in decarbonization. Estimates show that, if we still had the previous Conservative government, Canada's emissions would have been 41% higher by 2030. That is the equivalent, in terms of pollution, of adding another 69 million cars to our roads in Canada. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation> wants to slash legislation protecting our environment. He wants to allow Canada's largest polluters to pollute without limits and drive up the costs of climate change. We cannot let that happen. No sector is deserving of unlimited pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755803">First, let us talk about Canada's 2030 emissions reduction plan. It is a sector-by-sector path for Canada to reach our emissions target of 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan was introduced in 2022, and it reflects input from over 30,000 Canadians, provinces and territories, indigenous peoples, industry and Canada's independent net-zero advisory body.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755805">Pricing pollution is an integral part of Canada's climate plan; it is a carbon pollution policy that makes life more affordable while growing a clean economy by providing money up front to families. The Conservative Party of Canada does not want to talk about the fact that the carbon price is attracting new investments and creating jobs right across Canada. As a direct result of our climate action, Dow Chemicals is creating over 8,000 jobs and investing $11 billion in Canada to build a manufacturing plant. The president of Dow Chemicals said, “Canada has market-based carbon pricing.... That was an essential piece for us to decide to invest [there]”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755806">Pollution pricing is estimated to contribute about a third of the emissions reductions achieved so far under Canada's 2030 emissions reduction plan. There is a reason that countries around the globe are implementing pollution pricing systems. That is because it works. I will give us a few examples. The entire EU has created a cap-and-trade system, which is working really well. Their credit prices are now at €70 a tonne, which is about $103 Canadian, and that is considerably higher than the $80 a tonne that we have it set at right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755807">Many EU countries, including Finland, Switzerland and France, also have a separate price on pollution. South Africa has carbon pricing. New Zealand has cap and trade, with prices at $50 a tonne. Despite what the Conservatives say, some of the largest economies in the United States, such as California, New York and Washington state, have carbon pricing as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755808">Our ERP includes over 140 programs, policies and regulations to help Canada bend the emissions curve. They include phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, adjusting the Canada carbon rebate amounts in line with the price on pollution, and ensuring that the rebate continues to reflect the projected proceeds in each province where the fuel charge applies. A 20% rural top-up is available for households in rural areas and smaller communities across Canada. They also include cleaner fuels to power our vehicles and industries, increasing the supply of zero-emission vehicles and energy so that more Canadians can make the switch to cleaner and cheaper vehicles to operate. We are also adding more clean and reliable electricity to help our economy remain competitive. In addition, we are releasing Canada's methane strategy to cut emissions right across the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755809">While reducing our emissions is important for our environment, it is also very important for our health. I would like to highlight the very good work of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment. I met with them for the first time a couple of years ago, when I was parliamentary secretary for health, and they highlighted a really incredible program called PaRx, as in park prescriptions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755810">Physicians, in association with the BC Parks Foundation, gave out prescriptions for time outside as a method of improving people's health. They were also doing some advocacy about fossil fuel regulations. However, when we started talking about this incredible intervention to get more people outside, it sparked my interest. I love going outside, and as parliamentary secretary for health, it was really incredible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755811">Just yesterday, after about a year of work and meetings, I introduced all of these groups. BC Parks Foundation, my local conservation authority, Conservation Halton and Halton Healthcare were there and we announced that Halton Healthcare would be the first hospital consortium in Canada that had PaRx prescriptions available. The healing power of nature is available to constituents across Halton Region now because of the great work of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment and the BC Parks Foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755812"> I want to thank all parties involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755813">Next, I would like to talk about the investments for the clean renewable pathways program. That includes $50 million for the Bekevar Wind Farm in Saskatchewan, which will generate enough clean electricity to power over 100,000 homes. There are $50 million for the Oneida energy storage project in Ontario, which will help reduce Ontario's emissions by 1.2 million tonnes. There are over $12 million for the Enterprise solar project in Alberta, which is in construction and will create over 900 jobs. There are also $2.5 million for the Lac-Mégantic in Quebec to help support its net-zero microgrid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755814">Canada has now beaten China, and we are now the first in the world with respect to the most promising EV battery manufacturing economy. Our investments in the clean economy and our environmental plan will add an additional 400,000 jobs to the clean economy, according to the Canadian Climate Institute. Also, $48 billion are added to our economy with 250,000 jobs in the EV supply chain alone, according to the Royal Bank of Canada. In Ontario, Volkswagen is building its largest EV battery facility ever, creating over 30,000 new jobs, an incredible number for that community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755815">In Alberta, Air Products is investing $1 billion to build a hydrogen facility, creating 200 new jobs. In Newfoundland, Braya Renewable Fuels is converting Come By Chance's oil refinery into a renewable diesel facility, creating 200 full-time jobs and 800 during its construction phase.

Canada has shown that we can reduce our emissions while growing our economy and supporting Canadians by creating new and sustainable jobs in emerging sectors, driving innovation and environmental protection, providing economic opportunities for Canadian businesses right across the economic spectrum and increasing investments in clean energy projects. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755835"> Madam Speaker, today, we are here to talk about the 10th report of the environment committee, because the Conservatives have once again moved a concurrence motion in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755836">It is important for us to explain to Canadians, who may be watching the proceedings of the House of Commons and asking themselves why we are still sitting in this situation two months later. It bears repeating a little of why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755837"> First, the question is around privilege and documents that the Conservatives constantly say the government is not providing. What they fail to recognize is that the government has provided the documents to Parliament. The question is whether unredacted documents that are derived from a parliamentary order, from a majority of the House of Commons, should be passed off to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755838">The good news is that we have information from the RCMP. It has come out and said, “No thanks, Parliament.” It is fine with using the existing ways to gather evidence for any type of criminal prosecution. By the way, the government recognizes that the Auditor General's report on SDTC is a serious matter. A third-party investigation has been launched. The government has provided the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755839"> The Conservatives have moved a motion to let this entire question around whether Parliament should allow documents to be sent to the RCMP, unredacted, which could infringe on charter rights of any defendants, be moved to PROC. However, for two straight months now, the Conservatives have continually stood in this place to move amendments to their own motion, when every party in the House agrees that this matter should go to PROC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755840"> The record has to be set and understood, because we are wasting parliamentary time in this place. I do think it is important for my colleagues in the other opposition parties to ask themselves at what point would they support a closure motion on this question, so it can go to PROC. They bear some responsibility in the question about what they want to get for their constituents in this place, and what we can do to work together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755846">Madam Speaker, it has only been three minutes, but what I would say is that it is incumbent on all members of Parliament to ask themselves that question. Getting back to this motion, the Conservatives continue to use this as a delay tactic, not allowing other important questions to come before Parliament. When they go home tonight, I would encourage opposition members in the Bloc Québécois and the NDP to ask themselves what they want to get accomplished with the time we have remaining in this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755847">On the motion for concurrence on the 10th report, I have read the 10th report. I do not sit on the environment committee, but this did give me a good opportunity to go through the report and look at the recommendations. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="299800" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation> stood up this morning to move the motion, it was ironic that he did not talk about the Conservatives' environmental plan or what they would do at all. In fact, an amendment in relation to the net zero accelerator fund was moved and that was turned down by the Speaker. It was ruled out of order. Again, the Conservatives want to use this place to get up on talking points instead of getting work done, instead of actually being able to focus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755848">If we want to talk about the environment and investments in critical minerals and Canada's clean tech advantage, I will use my remaining six minutes to talk about that. However, I want to highlight the fact that it is remarkable to me that the Conservatives want to get up and talk about an environmental report tabled by the environment committee. I have sat in this place for five years and I have not seen a genuine effort by the Conservative Party whatsoever to tackle the question of environment, to tackle the question of how Canada leverages its strategic assets to make those investments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755849">We have heard a slogan “technology, not taxes”. That is a great slogan with no substance behind how we get there. How are we going to leverage those opportunities we have in Canada? How are we going to fund them? That is the part about which the Conservatives do not finish their sentences. When they talk about these things, they are not straight and clear with Canadians about what the cost would be to reduce emissions and drive up Canadian competitiveness. They do not have a substantive plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755850">I will give Erin O'Toole credit. In 2021, he started to go down this route. Of course, the backbench of his caucus wanted to pull him down for even mentioning the word carbon pricing. The Conservatives have not really given a genuine answer to this. I know right now that the question is around the pocketbook and affordability. It is around defence and international security. However, the environmental question plays into all of those things, and the Conservatives really do not have a serious answer on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755851">Let us take an examination of the record of the Conservative Party when we do have legislation that directly relates to economic growth or affordability. I represent Kings—Hants in the beautiful province of Nova Scotia. A lot of my constituents still use home heating oil in their homes. It is the most expensive way in the country to heat homes. It averages between double to four times the amount of those who have been able to transition off of home heating oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755852">This government worked with the Province of Nova Scotia, the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Province of Prince Edward Island, where the majority of households use home heating oil, to establish a program to help people make the transition off home heating oil, or certainly reduce their reliance on it. It saves thousands of dollars a month in home heating costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755853">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> said that the program did not exist. He said that it would not do any good. I have evidence in my riding, where energy bills have been reduced because of the efforts taken by this government. The Conservative Party has voted against it at every single turn. The Conservatives have not been there to help support these initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755854">Let us talk about Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>, which amended the Atlantic accords. This was simply legislation. It was not even necessarily an investment that the government had to make, or an expenditure, but just regulations to allow the possibility for offshore wind to help drive a decarbonization in Nova Scotia, in Atlantic Canada, and create meaningful jobs in my home province. The Conservatives stood against it at every single turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755855">What does the Conservative Party actually stand for? The Conservatives want to suggest that this government has done nothing on the environment. I would remind them that this is the only government in Canadian history, which is far from perfect, by the way, and I sit on the backbenches and do not suggest it is perfect, that has reduced emissions and grown the economy. No government in the history of our country has ever done that. I sit and listen in the House to the extremes from members like the member for <Affiliation DbId="299800" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation>, who suggests the government has done nothing. What is he talking about? Although I would agree in some facets about the way the New Democrats present themselves in the House as being more credible, sometimes I hear little to nothing from them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8755856">Have the New Democrats not seen the measures the government has taken? Should we do more? Absolutely. Is it our job as members of Parliament, as parliamentarians, to push the government and the executive, the Privy Council? Yes we should, but let us bring some air of reality to what we are actually dealing with here in this place, and to the complexities and the challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755857"> I know that some of my colleagues, including on my side of the House, in my party, when we talk about Trans Mountain, and the NDP, suggest it is in the national interest. Would we rather move oil, gas and bitumen by railroad? The market still is calling for these things around the world. My message to the NDP members when they say we should not have invested in a national interest and a pipeline to move the bitumen that would otherwise be moving on rail cars, do they think that is not a safer way to do it? The government intends to sell the pipeline to indigenous stakeholders to be able to support this. These are some of the complexities and the nuances we do not hear in this place and that we do not actually get in to legitimate debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755858"> The government does have to continue to focus on the question of Canada's strategic advantage in critical minerals. This matters not only from an emission reduction perspective; I would say that, even more importantly in this context, it also matters for our economy and for defence and strategic interests with the United States. We spent a lot of time in the House talking about the importance of the Canada-U.S. relationship. The government needs to continue to highlight it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755859"> All parliamentarians in this place should be focused on the question of how we can push the ability to reduce regulatory burdens that are not necessarily needed to advance the mining of critical minerals, but do so in a sustainable way. There is an ability to align processes, and I support some of the work the government has done in that place. We need to do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755860">I think about things like nuclear energy, the agriculture sector and forestry. There is so much we can do in efforts that drive innovation in those traditional sectors, but also reduce emissions at the same time. We have to continue to focus on the question as one of innovation and of economic growth. Of course, at the end of the day, if it reduces emissions and drives environmental benefit, that is the triple bottom-line win we should be looking for.</ParaText>

We are providing a safer way to move the bitumen that is already going to move, by the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755872">The question the government had is whether we should move bitumen by railroad or whether we should build a pipeline, which is a safer way to do it; should be able to sell the pipeline back to indigenous partners; and should be able to drive economic interests that matter in this country. I believe that the government and the Liberal party have a level of nuance on this. I would encourage the member opposite to certainly ask questions in her own house about where the NDP stands on its own plans around the environment.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8755886">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues today for debating concurrence in a committee report from the environment department on the path forward. In relation to this, one of the main things we come at in our dissenting report is that despite claiming that the cost of carbon tax would address climate change, the current Liberal government has failed to meet any carbon climate target. This is something that has to be brought forth here very specifically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755887">The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development Canada provided five reports to Parliament just a few weeks ago, in which he illustrated exactly what the government was not accomplishing with all of its efforts in this respect. When I say efforts, I mean up to 140 programs across government that are spending money and not reducing emissions at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755888">I will go into a lot of the guts of the reports, particularly the report in which the commissioner talks about the net-zero transition and where we are with respect to getting towards net zero in our economy, because he makes some significant statements in this regard. He goes on about this, saying, “Missing and inconsistent information, delays in launching important measures, and a lack of reliability in projections hindered the credibility of the plan.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755889">Before I go any further, Madam Speaker, I have to tell you that I will be splitting my time today with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278428" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755890">Recognize that we are getting zero emissions at the end of the day out of all the programs. Tens of billions are being spent on climate changes, effectively, the latest one of course being the emissions cap, which is a pie-in-the-sky thing, and we are going to eliminate emissions without putting down production. The only way we are actually going to eliminate emissions in Canada at this stage is by undoing our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755891">Especially in our resource production, undoing our economy means that resources are being produced elsewhere, which would mean higher emissions, lower labour standards and less benefit for the world. Therefore we continue on the path of making sure the government is exposed for the folly of its approach to how they are trying to get at emissions, because the emissions are not appearing at the end of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755892">I will go on with another of the commissioner's reports. He said, “The recent decreases to projected 2030 emissions were not due to climate actions taken by governments but were instead because of revisions to the data or methods used in modelling.” For 20 years, the department of environment has had a model that is not transparent about how it is measuring emissions in the Canadian economy. As the environment commissioner has stated, the whole model is flawed. Nobody can see it; therefore, it is effectively flawed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755893">The only way to reduce emissions is to change the inputs in its own modelling. This does not reduce CO2 in the atmosphere; all it does is make the model look like we are accomplishing something when we are accomplishing next to nothing. What we are accomplishing is the shutdown of the most productive part of the Canadian economy, our resource industry. That is part of what the government's virtue signalling is all about: saying we are doing something, but changing the metrics of how we measure what we are doing. The Liberals are trying to fool the Canadian public. It is deceitful and has to be exposed at its highest level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755894">It is not the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278515" Type="2">Calgary Centre</Affiliation> but the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development who actually said very clearly that the Liberals are monkeying around with the numbers. The next monkeying around they will do of course is to include in the numbers the actual absorption of CO2 embedded in Canada's forests, to make it look like they have actually accomplished something although that was not part of the inputs from the get-go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755895">There are a whole bunch of quotes from the commissioner that are very important, and I am going to go through a few more of them. Here is one: “This issue of the lack of transparency in the modelling continues to be an ongoing concern, which can undermine the trust and credibility in the reported progress.” Did members hear that? The government has lost all kinds of trust with Canadians and has also lost credibility with anybody who is paying attention to emissions and to our energy production systems in Canada, which need to be sustained in order for us to continue with our prosperous economy and to continue as a world leader in emissions reduction.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8755896">Fully three-quarters of the amount of money spent by private enterprise in this country on climate emissions reductions is spent by the oil and gas industry in making sure it gets cleaner production. That production, specifically in the oil sands, on the emissions profile per barrel of oil produced has gone down by 26% in the last 20 years. That outperforms any other industry in Canada as far as reductions associated with technological advances. When my colleague across the way talks about technology not taxes, we have clear illustrations of how that works. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755897">Businesses spending money on technology as opposed to spending money on taxes actually advance the science and advance the utilization of carbon-reducing emissions. This is what we are after at the end of the day. We want less carbon emissions per unit of production. We want to make sure we have a sustainable economy going forward. We want to replace carbon being produced around the world with more carbon-efficient and less-emitting options available here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755898">I will conclude with a quote from the commissioner of the environment: “This lack of transparency meant that accountabilities for reducing emissions remained unclear.” I beseech my colleagues on the other side of the House. It is not the opposition saying this; it is the government's own commissioner of the environment and sustainable development who is saying the Liberals are not getting anything done. The only thing they are accomplishing in numbers, and the numbers are down slightly from their peak pre-COVID, is not necessarily a result of anything the programs have designed; it is a result, significantly, of changes to the model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755899"> Now, the Liberals can change their input models all they want, but in the end, the world is getting more carbon in the atmosphere. We have to actually get less carbon in the atmosphere, so we need to find some programs and find some technology that actually accomplishes that. However, the government seems strained on that because it is bent toward that whole regulation and control as opposed to innovation and market decisions, which are going to be part of the future and the solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755900"> I said to my constituents, “When you have dug a hole this deep, it is time to stop digging.” That is the main thing. The Liberals have gone down the rat hole, and making sure they are producing less emissions is no longer their goal. The goal is to push more money out the door, and I am particularly worried about this—</ParaText>

The Canadian Climate Institute was at one of our committee meetings not long ago. We can take a look at what it is actually delivering, and it was getting, at that point, $11 million going up to $30 million. It is actually giving advice to the Department of the Environment because the Department of the Environment has no advice of its own. It is now, effectively, a department captured by special interest groups that get paid a lot of money to be special interest groups and therefore spin that wheel. Canadian taxpayer dollars are going out the door, with all kinds of organizations and individuals getting rich, and I could name those organizations and individuals if we had more time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755906">To wrap up, we are not accomplishing anything in the environment. The government needs to acknowledge that. The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development has acknowledged it. I beseech my colleagues on the other side of the House and in the other two opposition parties to read the report that says we are accomplishing nothing. We are spending tens of billions of dollars and we are getting nowhere. What more clarity do the Liberals need to make it understandable that we need to focus on technologies that are reducing carbon emissions in Canada as a benefit for the whole world? </ParaText>

Our economy was worth about $650 billion in 1998, and now it is worth $2 trillion. Our economy is three times the size it was in 1998, and we had the exact same emissions that we do now. </ParaText>

We had the overseas tax havens that cost us $30 billion a year, according to the PBO, again, with the Harper regime.

              <ParaText id="8755924">Madam Speaker, I feel as though your words were directed at me. That said, you are right, and I hope to make amends in the years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755925">I am very pleased to participate in this debate. I would like to remind members that, for more than two years now, I have had the privilege of sitting in the shadow cabinet as minister responsible for environment and climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755926">At our convention in Quebec City over a year ago, our Conservative leader, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> and member for Carleton, outlined the guiding principles of the Conservatives' approach to the environment. First, let me say that climate change is real. We need to face facts and adapt to it. We must continually reduce pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, choosing the right approach is where we differ. The ideological Liberal government is all about taxation and squandering money. The Conservative approach is much more pragmatic and focused on direct action. I will come back to that a little later in this speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755927">This Liberal government has been in power for nine years, and here is this government's record on the environment: Canada has the worst record of any G7 country, ranking 62nd out of 67 countries. That is the reality after nine years of Liberal government. That is the result of their management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755928">Recently, two programs have provided the most glaring example of bad investments so far. The government implemented one program and continued to manage the other. Unfortunately, the government managed these programs the Liberal way, that is, haphazardly and with a whiff of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755929">First of all, let us talk about the $8-billion net-zero accelerator initiative. That is a lot of money. Unfortunately, this program did not produce any results, and that is the problem. Yes, the government brags about its lofty principles and sets ambitious targets. The Liberals are always talking about their ambitious targets, but they are not getting results, and yet we are talking about $8 billion. The commissioner and the deputy minister responsible for this file stated in committee that they were unable to directly assess whether there had been a drop in greenhouse gas emissions. I am not making this up. We are talking about a net-zero accelerator, an accelerator to reduce emissions to zero, but we are unable to determine whether we actually managed to reduce emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755930">It gets worse. Let us talk about the testimony we heard in committee. The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development appeared before the committee on May 2 and 9. When we asked him how all of this was done, here is what he said, and I quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755931">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> We also found that the department did not always know to what extent GHG emissions had been reduced by those companies that took part in the [net-zero accelerator] initiative, or whether the funding provided would lead to reduced emissions.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755932">It is called the net zero accelerator. The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development told us there was no way to ensure that emissions would go down. After nine years of the Liberal government, there is no making this stuff up. Later on, in his testimony, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development said, “The majority of the contribution agreements do not have a commitment for reduction”. In fact, 12 of the 17 companies did not have to commit to reducing emissions, even though it is called the net zero accelerator. We need to speed up progress to net zero, but 12 of the 17 companies have no target. What kind of management is that? It is how the Liberals have managed things for the past nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755933">We asked for access to those documents. The government vetoed that categorically. Parliamentarians can look at the documents, but it is important to point out that it is an eyes-only situation. They cannot take notes or photos or do anything with the documents. They can only look. We sincerely hope that the documents will be made public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755934">Obviously, I cannot talk about what I saw, and I am certainly not going to get myself in trouble. I cannot say what was in those documents, but I can say that everything I saw should be known to Canadians. It was disturbing. All members of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development have access to it. We sincerely hope that all MPs can get access to it. Conservative members have seen the documents, and that is why my message to all Canadians is that they deserve to know how that $8 billion—the $8 billion they contributed—was spent.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8755935">Let us now talk about another program introduced by this government over the past five years, the green fund for sustainable development technologies. This fund was not a Liberal Party creation. It was active under other governments and, as a fund intended to help companies reduce their emissions, it was doing well. After disclosures were made in various media outlets, the Auditor General of Canada was instructed to look into what had happened with the now-infamous green fund. The results were very troubling, not in our estimation, or in the Conservative Party's estimation, but in the opinion of the Auditor General. Of the $500 million allocated over the past five years, this Liberal government had spent $390 million, which means that close to 80% of the money in this fund was not properly managed. Board members were allocating taxpayers' money to their own companies, in violation of the rules of good management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755936">When people realized how much turnover there was on the board of directors due to conflicts of interest, it became clear that some board members should not be there. So much coming and going should always be a red flag. It seems to me that this should be a wake-up call for people to want to do things differently. That is not what happened, which is very unfortunate. That is also why, after nine years under this government, not only is Canada the worst country in the G7, but it ranks 62nd out of 67 countries, according to the most recent report released at COP29 just a few days ago. In fact, I asked to table that document, but the Liberals refused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755937">Clearly, those folks did not meet the targets. They did not achieve what they set out to do and, more importantly, they do not know how to manage investment funds when they have them. As Conservatives, our approach is positive, constructive, effective and, above all, not dogmatic. At our convention in Quebec City a little over a year ago, in September 2023, our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> defined the four pillars of our environmental action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755938">The first pillar is the tax incentives in research and development in new technologies to reduce emissions. This needs to be done responsibly and not to make cronies happy, as the Auditor General concluded with the green fund, nor by committing billions of dollars—$8 billion in the case of the Liberals—without any real reduction commitments. As the Ethics Commissioner concluded, 12 out of 17 businesses received billions of dollars without any clear goals. What is that all about? Conservatives want a tangible, realistic, responsible approach that is respectful of taxpayers' wallets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755939">The second pillar involves giving a green light to green energy. We need more wind, solar, hydroelectricity, geothermal and nuclear energy in Canada. Yes, decarbonization leads to green energy. That is why we need it. We do not have enough. We need more. We need to give the green light to green energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755940">The third pillar is the Canadian advantage. In Canada, we have all the natural resources we need for decarbonization. Let us take lithium, for example. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> said when he became leader, we need Canadian lithium to electrify our electric cars. We want to give the green light to green energy and develop all the potential energy and natural resources that we have in Canada to make progress on this front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755941">The fourth pillar is working hand in hand with first nations. Too often in our history, when we arrived somewhere to pursue development and first nations were there, we signed a small cheque to make them go away because we were going to develop that area. That is not the right approach. We need an approach in which we create shared wealth, work as equals and become partners in prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755942">The Conservatives are taking climate change seriously, and we plan to provide tax incentives for new technologies, give the green light to green energy, develop natural resources to their full potential to further decarbonization and work hand in hand with first nations. I am really looking forward to an election that will result in a responsible government for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755954">I agree wholeheartedly with all my Conservative colleagues who have already risen on this matter. There is no question of privilege here whatsoever concerning the behaviour of the official opposition. If anything, the actual contempt here was when the <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">NDP deputy House leader</Affiliation> stormed up the aisle in a very physically demonstrative and verbally aggressive fashion to confront the Chair. She was quickly joined by the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755955">That was, of course, in plain view of anyone watching the television feed of Thursday evening's proceedings of the House. She also confessed to it in her intervention Friday afternoon when she said, “After we adjourned, I approached the Chair to ask how this could have been allowed.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755956">That is a very polite way of putting it. If we look at the tape, the camera was still running after the Speaker adjourned the House.

              <ParaText id="8755957">Standing Order 16(4) instructs us that, “When the House adjourns, members shall keep their seats until the Speaker has left the chair.” That clearly did not happen.

              <ParaText id="8755970">All that happened during Thursday night's vote was that 100 or so Conservative MPs, proud to be here to vote on behalf of their constituents, were voicing their opinion about the NDP's voting. If the Speaker actually watches the video of the vote, she will see that the four or five NDP members who were voting physically in the House actually reacted in a playful and good-humoured way, like gesturing that they could not hear, jokingly, what the Conservative colleagues were saying, not that they could not hear the Chair or the vote callers. They were actually looking at our members, joking around and playing it up for the cameras.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755973"> Now, I do believe that all that might have drawn a brief intervention from the Chair, and the House moved on, as it naturally would. It is the Speaker's job to enforce decorum, enforce the rules and apply them when he or she believes that it is getting to the point of being disruptive. Conservative members heeded the call of the Chair, and the House moved on, as it would.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755974"> As for specific allegations that were made, I have it on very good authority that we categorically reject the NDP's defamatory, spurious and completely unfounded allegations of anyone being intoxicated. If the Speaker really wants to take a look at the validity of those allegations, the two members who the NDP accused, in this chamber, that was again caught on video, are two members who are non-drinkers.

I think it is only fair and just that, after making these kinds of allegations, the official opposition be allowed to not only defend ourselves and our integrity, but also put the actual facts of the matter before the Chair if the Chair is going to rule on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755980">My NDP counterpart also claimed that pages were withdrawn from the opposition lobby because of what he alleged was the conduct of Conservative MPs. I was briefed by a representative of the House administration relating to the page program and was informed that the baseline issue that ultimately led to a decision being made happened earlier and was completely unrelated to behaviour in the lobby. It was an administrative issue within the page program itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755981">I can also say that during the evening there were requests from one side to the other, from the NDP lobby, to turn the volume down on the television that was on. It is a request that was accommodated. This is in stark contrast to the actions of NDP members that evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755982">I would also point out that I have been in this place a long time, and on both sides of the House. I have been in a situation where I have shared opposition lobbies with NDP members. They are often gathered together, having a jovial time, just as Conservatives were that evening. I have heard them playing guitars and leading each other in songs. That happens from time to time on late-night sittings. Both parties usually just accommodate each other when they are doing that. We have to share the same space. We try to stay out of each other's way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755983">This all has come as a complete shock to Conservative staff and Conservative MPs who viewed the events of that evening as exactly that. Our MPs in our corner of the lobby enjoying the evening, knowing that we were about to come in and vote on a confidence matter, having a playful time in the House of Commons, chirping the NDP members who were voting on another side of the issue, which they do all the time. They are now just being selectively sanctimonious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755984">That being said, let me talk a bit about the NDP member's conduct in the House. We saw unhinged conduct directed at the Conservative lobby coordinator by the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>. Not once, but on two occasions on Thursday night, she used profane language and likened him to a certain body part. On the second occasion, an NDP staffer had to physically come between her and the staffer in question, much like how the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms had to direct the <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">NDP deputy House leader</Affiliation> away from the Conservatives she was harassing, as seen on the video that hundreds of thousands of Canadians have witnessed so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755985">That interaction between the NDP member and the Conservative staff was an exercise of a position of power, to assert authority over and to bully an employee. There are witnesses to this conduct, as well as, I understand, a video, which I expect will be viewed in other forums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755986">Earlier in the evening, the hon. Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> was attempting to record a message for his constituents and Canadians about his work as our democratic reform shadow minister on Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document>, which proposes to delay the fixed-date election by a week in order to secure the pensions of 28 Liberal and NDP MPs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755989">Madam Speaker, while attempting to record this video, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> engaged in disruptive, harassing, obnoxious and nuisance behaviour directed toward my colleague and his work, trying to derail his ability to record the video. At the end of the night, another NDP MP delivered a bizarre and passive-aggressive rant to a second member of the Conservative staff for the simple courtesy of holding a door, which otherwise would have automatically closed in her face. It has not stopped there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755990">Yesterday, in the lobby, the former NDP whip gratuitously addressed a gross slur to my chief of staff. I raise this just as another example of the bizarre, weird and unhinged pattern of behaviour that NDP members of Parliament are exhibiting around the Parliamentary precinct. If we are going to ask why pages were asked to leave the lobby, let us look at the behaviour of the NDP MPs contributing to that feeling they might have had in their workspace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755991">What is unusual here is that the <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">NDP deputy House leader</Affiliation>, whose conduct Thursday night was shameful, as seen on ParlVU and in other videos published on social media, was trying to lead the charge for parliamentary civility and decorum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755992">In June, she wrote to all MPs, inviting us to sign a so-called pledge with four branches. Firstly, she wanted MPs to pledge to “Support each other and call out abuse and harassment when we see it or experience it.” That is exactly what we are doing now about the excessive toxic behaviour on open display by New Democrats. Secondly, MPs were asked to pledge to “Call on all our allies to stand with us to support women in office and call out all forms of abuse”—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8755995">Madam Speaker, I will sum up by saying the New Democrats have made baseless and false accusations that damage the reputations of individual members of Parliament. The old saying that a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its pants on is very appropriate here because they can make these allegations and, just by defending ourselves, we are contributing to the propagation of the falsehood. That puts all members in a very risky situation. Any one of us could get up at any time and make false accusations about who they saw in the parliamentary dining room bar and what one member said or did and not be held to account because the effect of the accusation plants the seed in people's minds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755996">Secondly, the behaviour by individual NDP MPs themselves was the cause for the breakdown of order in the House. The way they treated the Speaker, someone they have voted confidence in before, is absolutely shameful. They marched up the aisle, waving and hurling insults and abuse. It is clear that if anybody's privileges have been infringed, it is the Conservative MPs who are the subject of baseless allegations. If anybody's workplace was made toxic by behaviour, it was Conservative staff in the lobby because of NDP actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8755997">The proper thing to resolve this right now is for the New Democrats to withdraw their question of privilege, apologize to the Speaker for their behaviour, apologize to the Conservative MPs whose reputations they have slandered and put this matter to rest. </ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278390" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> came over here and sat eight seats away from me, in his own seat. At that point, the member came back here and was joined by at least three members from over there.

              <ParaText id="8756054"> The first petition is from residents living here in Canada. They say that Falun Gong is a traditional Chinese spiritual discipline that consists of meditation, exercise and moral teachings based on the principles of truth, compassion and tolerance. In July 1999, the Chinese Communist Party launched an intensive nationwide persecution campaign to eradicate Falun Gong and hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in forced labour camps, brainwashing centres and prisons, where torture and abuse are routine and thousands have died as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756055"> Canadian lawyer David Matas and former Canadian secretary of state for the Asia-Pacific David Kilgour conducted an investigation in 2006 that concluded that the Chinese regime and its agencies throughout China have put to death a large number, in the tens of thousands, of Falun Gong practitioners of conscience. Their vital organs were seized involuntarily for sale at a high price. Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting has received about 1.5 million petition signatures from over 50 countries and presented them to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, calling for immediate action to end the unethical practice of forced organ harvesting in China and an end of the persecution of the Falun Gong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756056"> The European Parliament passed a resolution condemning organ harvesting abuses in China and calls on the Government of China to immediately end the practice of harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756057"> Therefore, the undersigned petitioners request the Canadian Parliament and government to pass a resolution to establish measures to stop the Chinese Communist regime's crime of systematically murdering Falun Gong practitioners for their organs, amend Canadian legislation to combat forced organ harvesting and publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China.</ParaText>

Bill S-210 had the unanimous support of the Senate and the support of a majority of the House at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756084">The petitioners note that a significant portion of the sexually explicit material accessed online is not protected by any effective age verification method. The average age of first exposure to pornography is very young. It is, in fact, 11 or 12 years of age, so many young children are consuming this material who should not be. In fact, exposing children to sexual material is a form of child abuse. The petitioners also note that there is a great deal of research on harms associated with this early exposure, including reinforcement of gender stereotypes. These harms also include the development of attitudes favourable to harassment and violence, including sexual harassment and violence, especially towards women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756085"> The petitioners also say that online age verification technology is increasingly sophisticated and can effectively ascertain the age of users without breaching their privacy rights in any way. Therefore, petitioners call on the House to pass Bill <Document DbId="11474462" Type="4">S-210</Document>, the protecting young persons from exposure to pornography act.</ParaText>

I am just asking for some consistency and fairness in the practice so we all know, as members of Parliament, the frame of how these questions should be asked and whether an answer is respected or is given or not, as well as the consequences when a member from the opposition asks a question that is out of order. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756356">Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. While the government did ask its questions, you challenged them on their relevance to the administration of government, which is articulated very clearly throughout the course of our Standing Orders. When it comes to asking questions directly related to the confidence of the government, the coalition agreement and the fact that the fourth party continues to back the government in this place, this has direct relevance to the administration of governments. If a government cannot command the confidence of the House, it cannot administer the government. </ParaText>

To add to the intervention of the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation>, I would like to submit the following to you. There seems to be a precedent developing that if a member is of the side of the government, they belong to the political party of the government, and their question will not be answered if you deem it not to be in line with government business. The problem with that is that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278762" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation> and I are not members of the government. We are not parliamentary secretaries and we are not in cabinet. Therefore, we are entitled to the exact same rights you afford to every other member of the House. </ParaText>

If someone had stood and asked a question that used an inappropriate word, that member would be given an opportunity to rephrase the question and ask it again. In this instance, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278762" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation> has lost that opportunity to ask a question forever.

You would be equally right in cutting every single one of those frivolous and vexatious questions coming from the Conservative Party. It is not as if its members do not know the rules; they just refuse to respect them. I would ask you to have them respect the rules; that if the question is not dealing with government business, you cut it off immediately and not let them finish, because that is what the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle put in place in the House. </ParaText>

The only exceptions are questions addressed to committee chairs regarding the agenda of a committee or to a representative of the Board of Internal Economy.

              <ParaText id="8756427">I am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised on November 7 by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> concerning the refusal of a witness to answer questions at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.</ParaText>

                <B>The Speaker:</B> I will invite members to please carry on their conversations outside so that all other members who wish to can hear this message, especially the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756430">The committee had reported earlier that same day, in its 14th report, that a witness had refused to answer questions, even after being formally ordered to do so. This was Ms. Lauren Chen, who appeared before the committee on November 5.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756431">According to the member, the witness showed contempt for the committee and the House by refusing to answer. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> asked the Chair to find a prima facie question of privilege so that he could, according to his notice, move a motion calling Ms. Chen to the bar of the House to receive an admonishment and answer questions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8756432"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278406" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation> argued that this situation constituted a breach of privilege and even a contempt of the House. She noted that the witness refused to answer even the simplest questions and that these types of refusals are unfortunately becoming a trend. However, she did concede that Ms. Chen's refusal was based on the fact that she is facing a criminal investigation in the United States. This raises questions about the extent of the usual protections that a committee witness can expect from the cloak of parliamentary privilege. For that reason, the member suggested that the matter should be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8756433">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278424" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation> contended that Ms. Chen’s refusal to answer the questions of committee members was contrary to the House committees’ well-established expectation to receive answers from witnesses. She emphasized that allowing witnesses to disregard committee questions hindered their ability to seek accountability from individuals appearing before them. She urged the Chair to ensure that Ms. Chen was held to account for her flagrant disregard for the House’s authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756434">The <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the government House leader</Affiliation> also intervened. He stated that Ms. Chen’s reasons for not answering questions were based on her concerns about the risk of self-incrimination while under criminal investigation in the United States. He suggested that, while the House has the power to compel responses to members’ questions, the House needs to use its authority thoughtfully.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756435"> According to the <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs is the appropriate body for examining the circumstances and making recommendations to the House on a way to proceed. He also asserted that making a prima facie finding now would be premature and that both the Chair and the House should wait for the committee to report on the matter first.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8756436"> Historically, the House has tended to view the refusal by witnesses to answer questions with great seriousness. Having reviewed the committee proceedings of November 5, 2024, and having also considered the committee's report, it is clear to the Chair that Ms. Chen repeatedly refused to provide answers to questions posed by committee members. She stated that her refusal stemmed from concerns about self-incrimination in relation to ongoing investigations and court proceedings in the United States.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756440">Accordingly, I am satisfied that this matter touches on parliamentary privilege, and I am prepared to find that the matter constitutes a prima facie question of privilege. However, in the case before us, the Chair is also obliged to consider other unusual factors, especially in light of the course of action the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> proposes to take.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756441"> There are limits on the House’s jurisdiction over an individual located outside of Canada. <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, on page 981, in footnote 155, confirms that an order of the House to compel the attendance of a witness depends on the witness being in Canada. This is similar to a summons issued by a House committee. On the same page, it states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756443"> Erskine May, 25th edition, in a section entitled “Witnesses from overseas”, states at page 977, “Committees sitting abroad cannot exercise a power formally to send for persons, papers and records. Nor are witnesses summoned from overseas to give evidence in the United Kingdom”. On the same page, in respect of foreign nationals, Erskine May states that the power to summon is unlimited as long as the individual is “present within the jurisdiction of Parliament”. To my knowledge, Ms. Chen is currently in the United States.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8756444">These procedural authorities point to a central truth about the House’s power to compel the attendance of an individual, namely, that in using this power, the House must ensure it has the means to guarantee the desired outcome it seeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756445">The motion the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> appears to want to move would call for Ms. Chen to be found in contempt and be ordered to appear at the Bar. However, it may not be within the control of the House at this time to compel Ms. Chen’s presence before it. The situation very much leaves the Chair in a conundrum, as it does not serve the House’s interests to adopt orders it cannot enforce.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8756446">Accordingly, and as indicated already, I am prepared to find a prima facie case of privilege. I believe that, in the circumstances, the best course of action would be for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> to move that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. This would enable the committee to properly consider the unique elements of this case and suggest an appropriate and timely course of action to the House that ensures its privileges are respected. It may also provide more general guidance for any witness in similar circumstances to Ms. Chen’s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756447">I would like to make one last point. The House is currently seized with two motions on different matters of privilege. Only after the proceedings on the two questions of privilege are adjourned or disposed of will the member be in a position to move his privilege motion. This will afford time for the member to consult the clerks at the table for advice before finalizing the wording of his motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756448">Given the unanimity of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security's report on this matter, it is the Chair's hope that members will be able to come to an agreement quickly as to how to best dispose of this motion and, if adopted, to allow the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to undertake its study expeditiously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756449">I thank all members for their attention.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756453"> Mr. Speaker, this morning I handed a letter to your office informing you of my resignation, effective in January. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756454">After more than four years waiting, I now have a family doctor, and it is time to listen to his advice about putting my health first. This means these are likely my final remarks as the member of Parliament for Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke. I want to thank the Speaker and the House in advance for granting me some latitude today and, by doing so, perhaps saving me from having to write a book. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756455">Let me start by thanking all those who have supported me over what has been nearly 14 years as a member of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756456">First and foremost, I want to thank the constituents of Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke for giving me the privilege of representing them here for four terms. It has been and continues to be an honour to work with the diverse communities that make up this riding, including six municipalities, four first nations and the large contingent of military families. In particular, I am thankful for the support I have received from the South Asian community, the Jewish community and, of course, the 2SLGBTQI+ community, both in my riding and from across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756457">Special thanks also go to my campaign teams in six elections and all the volunteers and donors and the many trade unionists who always came out to support me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756458">My biggest thanks, of course, goes to my husband, Teddy Pardede. When I first told him I was considering running for office, he said, “Okay, honey, you go do that,” but he has steadfastly stood by me as a public figure despite it turning out to require a little more than that from him and to be a little more complicated all round. He has supported me as a public figure for 20 of the 25 years we have been together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756459">Members know I am a crier, and I promised I would not cry completely through the speech, but I am going to get a few opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756460">I have to confess that sometimes I am still a little astonished to actually be standing in the House. How did a queer kid from a farm in Nebraska, from a working-class family riven by domestic violence and child abuse, both shrouded in silence, become a member of Parliament? It was never part of my plan. I will always be grateful to Canada for providing me refuge more than 50 years ago, when it was still illegal for men to have sex with men in the United States, and for giving me so many opportunities to build a life here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756461">Who is to blame for me being a New Democrat MP? Well, it started with Tommy Douglas, who signed me up as a party member when he was my MP in Nanaimo more than 45 years ago; I had to sign the card before I got dessert. That resulted in my working with and for the party for over a decade, including a stint on Ed Broadbent's staff here in in Ottawa nearly 40 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756462">After that time, I spent over a decade involved in human rights and international solidarity work. When I arrived back in Canada after a year of human rights work abroad and took up teaching again, I fell for an invitation from the new NDP leader, Jack Layton, to have lunch to discuss my human rights work. We did discuss human rights, but at the end of that lunch Jack said, “I'll bet you think there should be gay members of Parliament,” and of course, I agreed. Then he said, “Well, how do you think they get there if people like you will not run?” So I agreed, despite repeatedly having said no before and despite the many, myself included, who thought the path for a gay New Democrat running in the second-largest military riding in the country was more than a little uphill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756463">When I came to the House, it was after two losses, but more importantly, it was after more than 20 years teaching criminal justice, after serving as a municipal police board member and city councillor, and after working as an international human rights researcher in Indonesia, East Timor and Afghanistan, where I was often in the field alongside Canadian peacekeepers. I have tried to be true to who I am and to bring the expertise I acquired along the way to my work here in the House. As an out and proud member of the queer community, I hope I have demonstrated that diversity is one of our strengths as a nation and that more diverse Parliaments do indeed make better laws. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756464">From 2011, I have been privileged to serve as the NDP spokesperson for queer rights. Fourteen years as the critic on one topic may be some kind of record, I am not sure, and we are still the only party to have such a position. I am proud to have successfully led initiatives in the House to add transgender rights to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the hate crimes section of the Criminal Code, to ban conversion therapy, to bring an end to the gay blood ban and to provide a path to safety in Canada for queer and trans refugees whose lives are at imminent risk. However, I want to stress that any progress on queer rights that has been made here has only been possible because of years of struggle at the grassroots level across the country by the queer community and the always unwavering support of my caucus, our <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> and, I have to say, key MPs in other parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756465">In the House, I have also served as the NDP public safety, defence and justice critic over the years. Again, I have been able to lead initiatives in the House that have led to the elimination of criminal records for the personal possession of drugs in this country and to expand access to community-based bail supervision, both to help make communities more safe and also more just. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756466">Some things are still left undone. My initiative on coercive and controlling behaviour in intimate partner violence, now in the form of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>'s private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="12433708" Type="4">C-332</Document>, remains stuck in the other place, despite having passed here unanimously last summer. I remain disappointed that my repeated attempts have failed to convince both Conservative and Liberal governments to remove self-harm from the military code of conduct as a disciplinary offence, an initiative that would signal an important change in attitude toward mental health in the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756467">I have been privileged to be able to bring the whole of who I am to my work here in the House, despite increasing levels of harassment and threats for doing so. I am disappointed that we failed to pass my private member's bill to add the queer community to federal employment equity legislation so we can have a workforce that fairly represents the whole of the country we are. As a gay man who lost many friends in the first round of the AIDS epidemic, I remain perplexed by the government's failure to take the measures necessary to eliminate new cases of HIV in this country by 2030. All it would take is decriminalizing HIV non-disclosure and modest annual expenditures on community-based testing and treatment programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756468"> As an MP, I have also worked to provide strong service to my riding. I successfully secured better protections for southern resident killer whales, got federal funding for the initial cleanup of Esquimalt Harbour and delivered support for the local shipbuilding industry, as well as providing strong advocacy for individual constituents in their dealings with the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756469">Let me stop to say how important the support is that I have received from my staff here in Ottawa and in my constituency office, most of whom, breaking the rule, are here in the gallery right now. They have been loyal and long-serving. Again, maybe I have set some records here; I have one staff person who has been with me from day one, and we refer to the other person in the office as the junior staff person because they have only been here 12 years. The same is true in my constituency office. None of what I have been able to accomplish would have been possible without their support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756470">I am especially proud to be part of this, my fourth, NDP caucus, which is particularly skilled and hard-working and which, under the leadership of Jagmeet Singh, has secured many important victories for ordinary working Canadians—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756474">I came to the House believing, as most of us do, that we can work together despite our differences to make both Canada and the world a better place. I have worked with MPs from all parties on common initiatives and much of that work was done at the committee level. During my time at the defence committee, over five years, I worked with Liberal chair Stephen Fuhr and the Conservative spokesperson, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278158" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation>, and together we were able to visit Canadian Forces trainers working in Ukraine, members stationed with NATO in Latvia and Canadian peacekeepers in Mali. As well, we managed to send the House more than 20 unanimous reports on how to improve Canada's defences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756475">I only wish committee work like this would get half the public attention that the theatre that is question period gets from both the media and the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756476">Unfortunately, we now live in the midst of a rising tide of hate and violence, and it is more important now than ever that each of us continues to speak out against hatred. I remain appalled by the constant attack on transgender Canadians, especially transgender kids. I am disturbed by the ongoing wave of incidents of anti-Semitism nationally and even in my own riding. Solidarity matters when fighting against hate, whether it is directed toward my community or any other community in this country. As once a new Canadian myself, I will always speak out against attempts to blame newcomers for all our ills. None of this hate, none of this attack on immigrants, none of this attack on transgender people is part of the Canada that most of us have always been so proud to be part of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756477">While remaining a firm advocate for my riding, the queer community and greater equity in Canadian society, my time in Parliament has always been devoted to finding common ground to advance all Canadians, especially the most marginalized among us. I hope those of us members of Parliament who still believe we can find the common ground necessary to move forward will stand against those who wish to make MPs nothing more than cheerleaders for opposing teams seeking power. There is always a choice for each of us as a member of Parliament, and I am hopeful MPs from all parties will make the choice to rise above these current challenges. </ParaText>

We had a lot of interactions, in my time as parliamentary secretary and also now in my time as minister, on passion projects of his, but he also spent time teaching me about the other things he would be working on, whether they related to public safety or defence causes, etc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756483">With respect to the passion with which he approached the fight and the causes that he believes in, we will not find a more dedicated advocate for the 2SLGBTQI+ community than the member for <Affiliation DbId="278615" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation>. I also remember his telling me, “Arif, that's such a mouthful”, and asking me why we do not just use “SOGI”, which is “sexual orientation and gender identity”. I thought that made a lot of sense, but I will use whatever terms he wants, because I take my cues on such issues from the member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756484">I have known the member as a passionate advocate for working diligently on projects that really affect all Canadians. We have heard him talk about the fact that the fight for the rights of the queer community extends all of the time to people right around the country, but never more so than with the rights of transpeople right now, and particularly trans children. I salute the member for the leadership he has shown on a cause that really should not be partisan in the chamber or anywhere else, because ultimately we are dealing with a subset of a community and with young, vulnerable kids. That is a testament to what the member puts his priorities into and where he dedicates his energies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756485">Working together with the member on issues such as medical assistance in dying and how we move from where we were in 2016 through 2019 and through 2021, I have always relied upon his wise counsel and advice. There has obviously been a partisan element to the work we do; that is part of what we do here in the chamber, but what I have always found in the member is that he understands where to replace partisanship with principle in terms of collaborating productively to advance the causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756486">In terms of advancing the fight against hate, again, I have not seen a more co-operative or collaborative member, who is willing not just to step up to the task at hand but also to make it personal, because ultimately politics is personal. When he has stood up with such alacrity and such candour and talked about his own life experiences, as he just did here in a very emotional moment for him, talking about how his own life has taken him through different twists and turns and brought him to the place where he stands as a four-time member of Parliament, he has spoken honestly and compassionately about what he believes in. I applaud him for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756487">I remember distinctly the conversations we had during the blockade of this city, and what he faced as a gay man in terms of particular targeting during that time. We talked about what we need to do collaboratively together, as all parliamentarians of every political stripe, to combat that kind of hatred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756488">We have also had important conversations about abuse and about children. I salute the member for always putting the needs of kids above all else. I will give one tangible example. I represent the largest Tibetan diaspora in the world outside South Asia. What I have found in the member, through his work with constantly taking on Tibetan Canadian youth as interns in his office, is an effort by him not just to do right by those young people and to provide them with mentorship, but also to actually take it to the next level, where he both provides mentorship to the young people and also uses tools on the floor of the chamber to actually advance causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756489">What I am talking about are things like the effective use of Order Paper questions and of petitions. In doing so, he is not just taking on a young person who might not otherwise get a chance, but he is actually advancing the yardsticks of causes that they believe in, which is I think is the best of both worlds in terms of a mentorship exercise. He is not just committed but he is also savvy about the parliamentary tools. He mentioned some of those tools in the work he had done on the defence committee, in terms of advancing the yardsticks.</ParaText>

He is committed to his riding. He is committed to his portfolio. He is committed to defending the interests in which he believes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756491">If politics is the art of the possible, I would say that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278615" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> shows always what is possible and what can be achieved, with tremendous success. He has distinguished himself in committee. He has distinguished himself in the chamber as a man of principle and as a man of integrity. What I would say is that he will be missed. He should enjoy retirement; my friend deserves it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756492">Mr. Speaker, it was very powerful when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278615" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> shared that Jack Layton had recruited him. If Jack should have the credit for recruiting him, I will take a little credit for trying to keep him in the House for as long as possible. I mean that really personally. I had to ask the hon. member multiple times to stay on as member of Parliament. I owe him a life debt of gratitude for agreeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756493">I asked the member to stay on for many reasons. One is that I trust his counsel very dearly. He is someone who gives me a lot of really great advice. As we can see, he does a lot of really important work in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756494">One of the things about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278615" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> that I want to share is that he shared the pain he endured as a child, the trauma and the violence that he saw and that he himself experienced. What we can see in his life's work and in the way he brings himself to the world is that he did not let that pain extinguish his joy and his deep belief that we can build a better world. Despite the pain he endured, he approaches his life with the passion that better is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756495"> Another thing that we might know about the member is that he wants no other child to ever experience that same pain again, to feel like they do not belong. It is a big part of what guides him in the work he does. I see that and I feel that we are all better off because of the passion that he brings, the care that he brings and the personal tragedy that he turns into the powerful motivation for the work he does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756496">On a personal note, I remember when the member first told me that he was going to message me on my cellphone, not often but whenever he thought it was appropriate. I did not realize that meant he would send me essays on my cellphone. Those essays that he would send every now and then, true to his word, not all the time but when he did, would guide me in the right direction and would encourage me when times were tough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756497">The member reminded me often that he chose me and endorsed me early on and that he never regretted his choice. There are times when he might have, or times when it was hard to say that he continued to support me, I would say, but I really value his friendship, his commitment, his loyalty and the fact that he reminded me often that he was proud of his choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756498">I am proud to call the member a friend. I am proud to call him an ally. I am proud that he chose to be a part of the movement. I am so thankful he said yes to Jack. I think all of us in the chamber have seen the difference that he has made. Kids in this country are safer because of him. Because of his work, there are more little members for <Affiliation DbId="278615" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> who are going to be less scared, less afraid and less feeling like they do not belong.</ParaText>

As a newer MP in this place, I can say that he is an hon. member whom I have been really grateful to have had the chance to learn from and I am grateful for our time here to have overlapped. In my time prior to being here, he was someone I really looked up to as someone who continued to stand up for the queer community across the country. As we heard from his speech, he has had such an impact on the laws of this country in the way that so much more needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756508"> As we close this round of speeches, though, to me it is appropriate that the member would have the last word. If the Speaker would allow me, I would remark that the tenor in this place at times, and certainly now, can get somewhat partisan.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756513">Mr. Speaker, just before I dive into the substance of what will be, I have no doubt, of great interest to all those in this place when it comes to the SDTC scandal that has continued to paralyze this place and the Liberal government, specifically the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s refusal to simply release the documents, there are just a couple of quick things I would like to note. One is very personal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756514">When I get home on the weekends, I see, in particular, my grandmas. My one grandma, she texts me. My other grandma, I just see her whether it is at church on Sunday or when I go to visit her. They often compliment me on my speeches and whatnot. Sometimes I think we wonder if anybody is actually watching these proceedings. I know both my grandmas, Linda and Nora, are, so here is a shout-out to both Grandma Linda and Grandma Nora, two fine women, and to my grandfathers who have passed on. They have an incredible legacy there. I love my grandma, and I love my grandma. This is a shout-out to them because there is a good chance they are watching. I am thankful for that latitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756515">Here we are back debating the green slush fund, where we have an instance of nearly $400 million of taxpayers' money. Let me pause there because I think there is an important distinction I would like to elaborate on a little bit. We have an instance where there is this $400 million that has been misallocated, wrongly allocated to organizations, companies, etc. It has been called into question. It is close to $400 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756516">What is important is not just the dollar amount. Do not get me wrong; it is a huge number. What is key in understanding this and why it is such a significant thing for us to get answers on and for us to get true clarity when it comes to what happened here is that this is $400 million not of the government's money. The government does not have money in and of itself, but rather it has money it derives from taxes. It is the money it derives from taxes that it then spends. This is often forgotten in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756517">As parliamentarians from all parties, we need to take seriously that it is not the government's money to spend, but rather it is for us to be stewards of the dollars paid in taxes by Canadians. This fundamental premise is so often forgotten. We have seen time and time again over these last nine years under the NDP-Liberals that they have forgotten where the money comes from. The result of that is an utter disregard that leads to scandals like the one we are seeing today, where we have an unbelievable amount of money, close to $400 million, being misallocated, allocated where there were conflicts of interest, etc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756518">I will get into the privilege side of that here in just a moment, but what is absolutely key is that the amount of money this relates to is truly astonishing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756519">In comparison, most Canadians who will be watching, whether it is my grandmas, as I referenced earlier, or so many others, are wondering what the deal is with this $400 million. It is said that, when economists do evaluations when it comes to the dollars in an economy, often the most easily understood dollars in terms of amounts are not the numbers and figures parliamentarians quite often throw around when an announcement has millions or billions of dollars associated with it. When it really comes down to it, an average Canadian family's biggest expense it will make is the purchase of its home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756520">While we have seen a doubling of house prices over the last decade under these NDP-Liberals and we have seen some real challenges in terms of Canadians being able to afford the basics, the carbon tax impact on all of these things and the inflationary effect it has had across our economy and everything related to that, the average Canadian spends less than a million dollars on a home.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756521"> We have an example where the largest purchase that the average Canadian family ever makes is one four-hundredth of the tax dollars that have been abused when it comes to this green slush fund. The scale and the impact is truly astonishing, and we can break that down further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756522">A common investment within most households is that of a vehicle. I know it has been called into question. I did not even know Maserati made SUVs, but that has certainly been publicized here as of late as the choice of vehicle for the leader of the fourth party. I looked at the price. For somebody who claims to be from the middle class, that is quite a claim when someone drives that type of vehicle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756523">We have the average vehicle. When it comes to what Canadians spend, the average between Canadians buying used vehicles and those who buy new, we have before us the average price of a vehicle equating to about $40,000. That is the average from the very expensive Maserati, like the one the leader of the fourth party drives, to Canadians who are just starting out drive, like a 16-year-old buying their first vehicle for several thousand dollars. We have an average of about $40,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756524">We can think about the scale of $400 million versus $40,000. It puts it into context. The reason I am flagging this and providing that context is that it is truly astonishing, the scale of this scandal with the hard-earned dollars taxpayers earned and paid to the government through taxes. We saw money misallocated and misappropriated, and through a scandal-ridden process, we have this abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756525">I would suggest this bears repeating because of the failures that have been exposed. The former minister of industry took an organization that, under the previous Harper government and under the scandal-plagued Martin and Chrétien governments before, was operating fairly well. It had a high efficiency rate and a good return on investment, and it certainly did not have the types of scandals that we are seeing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756526">We had three successive governments that, under their leadership, saw this organization do its job, which was to invest in sustainable technologies. This included times when there might be a business case with a bit higher risk, so going with partnerships in terms of private lending and whatnot. We saw a good return on taxpayers' investments, those hard-earned dollars that the government takes that could be leveraged for economic development. However, in 2018, the former minister, Navdeep Bains, fired Harper's board and installed Liberal insiders. This is where the problems began to brew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756527">We have seen, over the last five or six years, the result of this $400 million that has been called into question. It is truly astonishing the scale of the scandal we have before us. Now we have, I believe, week six, maybe going into week seven, of Parliament having been seized with this issue. It has been paralyzed by this scandal that has shaken the very foundations of our democratic infrastructure and is calling into question for so many Canadians whether or not they can trust the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756528">I talk often about trust in this place because trust is a key element of what we do here. It is the idea of the social contract. In fact, I spoke to a class this morning, and it was a very interesting discussion. I always appreciate it. It was a grade nine class from the Prairie Christian Academy in Three Hills, Alberta. They are a great group of kids with great questions and very engaging conversation. It truly was a great opportunity to talk about how to get involved in government, citizenship and the responsibility of that. It was an incredible conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756529">One of the things that we talked about was the idea of the social contract. Although that is often a topic of conversation that happens in university philosophy classes, the reason I bring up the idea of the social contract is that there is this back-and-forth, this tension that exists. Citizens have responsibilities in order to have freedoms. There is a tension that exists. We have to be able to trust the government for it to be able to function appropriately in our country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756530">Where we see the social contract being called into question is that, after nine years of the Liberals, there has been an erosion of trust that has taken place. The erosion of trust that has taken place is forcing many Canadians across our country to lose trust not only in the person who is in charge, the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and those in the Liberal Party and the NDP who continue to prop him up, but they are losing trust in the very foundational institutions of our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756531"> Those institutions have persisted, in the case of Canada, for 157 years, with responsible government coming several decades before that and different types of administrations prior to that point in time. Our history of our democratic system dates back more than 800 years to the United Kingdom, wherein the first few sentences of the British North America Act, now known as the Constitution Act of 1867, talk about its being similar in form to that of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Westminster system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756532"> We are seeing this mismanagement call into question the trust that Canadians should have in their institutions. I would suggest today that of all the things that we debate, this truly is one of such significance because it is the keystone on which we continue to ensure that we have a strong and functioning democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756533">We have to be able to trust that our government works. Let me unpack that for just a moment. We need to ensure that it is not simply trust in an individual, because no government is an individual. The reality here is that we have an erosion of trust in the institution in and of itself. Whereas we used to be able to say we might not like the guy or gal in charge but we could respect the office, it has come to the point where, truly, there are so many instances of people losing trust in the institutions themselves. That is something that should seize each and every one of us as parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756534"> The basic premise of trust in our institutions underlies the debate we are having, and when it comes to the very basics, we have to release the documents. It is simple, just three words: Release the documents. It is not that hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756535"> We have Parliament, which has constitutionally unfettered access and the ability to demand documents. In fact, in the constitutional framework, which was written long before the advent of computers, we have the ability for government to demand any document that exists in Canada. Any Parliament can demand that. It is within its rights to demand any document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756536">Over the last nine years, we have seen something that I would like to unpack a little here. Not only is it a refusal of the government to release the documents in relation to this $400 million in taxpayers' money that has been misallocated where there were conflicts of interest, etc., but we are seeing how, in the midst of this, it is truly the continuation of a pattern. This pattern could be summed up by a phrase: It is that the Liberals, under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, have normalized constitutional crises. I say that, not flippantly, but with all seriousness, because, time and time again, we see how they have an utter disregard for the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756537">When most Canadians think of the Constitution, they think of the thing that is often on the walls of classrooms, which is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That is an important aspect of our Constitution. It has Pierre Elliott Trudeau's signature at the bottom of it, although in the history of that, for those who might be watching, what was eventually adopted was certainly different from what Pierre Elliott Trudeau had envisioned, but he was certainly happy to take credit for it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756538">However, we have that as part of our Constitution, as well as a host of other constitutional documents, including one I referenced earlier, which is the British North America Act, or the Constitution Act 1867. We have a host of constitutional documents, dating back to the foundation of this country, which lead all the way to where we are today. There was a minor constitutional amendment just a number of years ago on the number of MPs who would represent each province in this place. We have a series of documents and, when it comes to constitutional law, it is a series of written and unwritten laws that define the Westminster system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756539">What we have before us shows that the government has an utter disregard for constitutional conventions and for the role of the 800-plus years of constitutional history that has built this Westminster system. The Liberals have an utter disregard for the things that have allowed us to function as a free and open democracy. It is not without its challenges, but certainly the Liberals are putting our institutions at risk with the normalizing of constitutional crises. I would highlight one that comes to mind, and I often hear from constituents about this. It is the Winnipeg lab scandal, when there were documents that Parliament demanded. It was a minority Parliament. The 2021 election, despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise that he would not call it, but then he called it anyway, seemed to leverage much of the fear that Canadians had about the COVID pandemic, which seems to be a big part of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756540">What happened during that summer was absolutely astounding. The government took Parliament, specifically the former Speaker, to court over a document request and a constitutional crisis. This was unbelievable and unacceptable. The election took place. Was that the reason the Liberals called the election? Was there something that was so revealing that it would have brought down the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government and would have exposed them? I do not know, but what is very clear is that the Liberals will stop at nothing, including ripping up the Constitution, to try to cover up their scandals time and time again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756541">In 2020, the Liberals proposed to give themselves unlimited spending and taxation powers. Just to give some context, that would have torn up 800 years of tradition that demands responsible government, including money only being spent with the permission of the House and taxes only being levied by Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756542"> We see that we have before us an astounding series of events that have lead us to the privilege debate we are having today. The Liberals could end this immediately. They could end it. They simply have to release the documents. In doing so, they would put to rest the crises that they have brought forward, which have not only kept them from being able to accomplish their agenda, but also caused an erosion of trust in the very institution of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756543">I will conclude my remarks by referencing some of the extraordinary Canadians whom we work for. I had the opportunity to meet with constituents, including the fire chief from Hanna, Alberta, Mr. Mohl, and a couple of his colleagues. One was from Redwater and the other from Grande Prairie. They are small-town and small-city fire chiefs. It was a good conversation. They came and saw question period. What was encouraging in the midst of that was to see Canadians at work. In this case, they are small-town emergency services personnel who are ready to do the work when called upon. I compliment them. I know there is advocacy that is taking place on the Hill this week, and I wish them the best in that. I appreciate the opportunity to have met them earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756544">When it comes down to it, we need to take seriously our responsibility as parliamentarians. We need to ensure that we are responding to the call and, when it comes to the very crux of the issue here, that we restore trust in our institutions. That can start with the Liberals releasing the documents so we can get back to work.</ParaText>

This is because Conservatives are not interested in sending this to PROC, where their own motion calls for it to go. They are interested in preventing the House from doing any work. Until this point, it would have been work on meaningful and important legislation that has a genuine impact on Canadians. Now, we need to deal with a really serious issue that this country is facing, but Conservatives are preventing us from talking about it. That issue is foreign interference. </ParaText>

He said the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> won handily. I bet he did, especially with a bit of help, but that is not the question. Nor is the question whether the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> was coerced or ultimately made a decision based on the conversations that were had with her. The question is this: Did any foreign diplomat or foreign individual say anything to the member for Calgary Nose Hill? If they did, and if they were trying to influence the outcome of the campaign she was involved in, then that is considered foreign interference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756588">It does not matter who won. It does not matter whether she was influenced by it. What matters is whether the interference took place. Conservatives will try to cloud this and say that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> won handily anyway; he took all of Alberta, and there is absolutely no issue. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> will say that there was nobody and that she is a seasoned politician who knows how to handle herself. We would not know that by the way she ran away from the CBC yesterday. However, that is not the issue. The issue is whether she was contacted and somebody tried to influence her. That is foreign interference. Canadians have a right to know if she was approached. We have a right to know who those actors are so that we can properly deal with them and they do not continue that behaviour. That is in the public interest. That is in Canada's interest. </ParaText>

When the member says that it works, he is fully admitting that they are just throwing out slogans to try to persuade people. They do not care about policy or anything else; they are just throwing out stuff to try to fool Canadians. What response do I get when I say that? It is that it works. Conservatives are admitting that their plan to fool Canadians with their slogans is working. That is, ultimately, where we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756593">Why is this so important, and how does it tie back to this particular motion?

              <ParaText id="8756629">My speech this evening is going to be more or less about censorship, disinformation and misinformation. The Liberal government is moving down a spiral of authoritarianism. It is a very deceptive government that is definitely not about transparency as it originally promised it would be. It is a government using every single legislative tool to censor and to control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756630">Around the world, government censorship is constantly being used to silence opposing opinions, suppress transparency and accountability, and consolidate power. We see this form of government censorship in several countries: Russia, China, North Korea and, yes, Canada. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, we are witnessing a new level of government censorship more than ever before in Canada. The issue today is about contempt of Parliament and about fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756631">The government's censorship threatens the very foundations of our democracy. Without the ability to demand production of documents, speak our mind, express our views and challenge the status quo, we are left with nothing but the hollow illusion of freedom. The government censorship we are witnessing here today is not about protecting Canadians from harm or ensuring public safety. Instead it is about silencing dissent, shutting down debate and consolidating power. It is about covering up corruption and fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756632">With respect to the question of privilege, we are addressing government censorship regarding the failure to produce documents ordered by the House on the scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, otherwise known as the Liberal billion-dollar green slush fund. However, while the power of the House is supposed to be supreme, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal department, the Privy Council Office, decided to execute the order by telling departments to send in documents and censor them through redaction to cover up corruption and to cover up fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756633">This form of government censorship completely breaches a member's privilege because the order from the House did not say to redact. The government has opted to defy the House and to censor information in the SDTC documents at every single step of the way, as it does not want Canadians to know that through the green slush fund, $400 million has gone to Liberal insiders. It may be twice that amount because the Auditor General could not complete the full audit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756634"> The scandal as well, it is really important to recognize, compromises two current cabinet ministers and one former cabinet minister. I would like to say that it is a surprise that the government would behave in this manner, but based on the government's track record, government censorship and fraud are nothing but the expected. In other words, for the government, it is business as usual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756635"> Perhaps this is a very good time for my colleagues to talk a little bit about a history lesson. Remember the Liberal sponsorship scandal? The last time the Liberals were in power, they funnelled $40 million to their friends and orchestrated a sophisticated kickback scheme. Then they got caught at fraud, corruption and cover-ups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756636">The best predictor of future behaviour, I would suggest, is past behaviour. Is the SDTC scandal part of the latest Liberal kickback scandal? Where did the money go? This one scandal is at least 10 times greater than the sponsorship scandal. It is another in a long list of scandals that the Liberals are trying to cover up through censorship.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756637">I should probably define what I mean by censorship. Censorship is “the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.” I would suggest “politically unacceptable” is why the Liberal-NDP government champions censorship. I should probably define a few other terms. Misinformation is “the inadvertent spread of false information without intent to harm”. Disinformation is “false information designed to mislead others and is deliberately spread with the intent to confuse fact and fiction.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756638">Another word is a controversial new term, malinformation, used to describe the NDP-Liberal government, a “term for information which is based on fact, but removed from its original context in order to mislead, harm, or manipulate.” In other words, malinformation is “true but inconvenient” for the government and its narrative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756639">Under the guise of combatting disinformation and hate speech, the government has implemented policies that give it the power to silence voices, censor information and withhold documents that do not conform to its own woke ideological agenda.

Instead of arresting provocative pro-Hamas supporters who spewed hate, celebrating genocide while chanting “from the river to the sea”, an independent member of the press was arrested for simply doing his job, arrested by the very police who have sworn to protect his charter rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756641">We wonder why Canadians are questioning whether this is the country they grew up in. When a Jewish man gets arrested by Toronto police in his own neighbourhood while supporting a vigil for families whose loved ones were massacred and kidnapped on October 7, while members of the hateful mob are allowed to continue their mockery of the victims' suffering, we have to ask ourselves why the government condones this hateful behaviour, censors first-hand accounts of cruel anti-Semitism and supports police who discriminate. When governments and our institutions condone this behaviour, it is as if they give a stamp of approval, and that definitely is not okay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756642">What about the government's history of pushing through authoritative legislation? Let us take a look at that. Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the Online Streaming Act, according to the NDP-Liberals, aims to modernize the Broadcasting Act. However, it harms Canadian digital creators by limiting their services and ability to reach global audiences. It also allows the government boundless powers to regulate digital content and gives it the authority to control what Canadians can and cannot access online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756643">This is a direct assault on the freedoms of expression and access to information that have flourished in this digital age. Instead of letting Canadians choose for themselves what to watch and listen to, the government seeks to impose its own narrative, prioritizing state-approved content over independent voices and diverse viewpoints. Our young, bright Canadian content creators are being stifled. If other jurisdictions also decide to put forward legislation like this, it will mean Canadian content will be a lower priority for the rest of the world and that could damage our entertainment exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756644">The government's censorship does not stop there. Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>, the Online News Act, also allows the government to get in the way of what people can see and share online. This bill requires Internet companies to distribute royalties to newspapers whose content is shared on a site. It demonstrates the government choosing to side with large corporate media while shutting down small, local and independent news, as well as giving far too much power to the government to regulate without limitation. As a result, local and independent media outlets that might challenge the government's narrative are left vulnerable, and those that conform are rewarded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756645">Common-sense Conservatives believe we need to find a solution in which Canadians can continue to freely access news content online, in addition to fairly compensating Canadian news outlets. However, when we offered amendments to the bill that would address these several issues, the NDP and the Liberals voted them down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756646">Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> is another testament to this government's continuous commitment to censorship. The online harms act would create costly censorship bureaucracy that would not make it easier for people experiencing legitimate online harassment to access justice. Instead, it would act as a regulatory process that would not start for years and would happen behind closed doors where big-tech lobbyists could pull the strings.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756647">The common-sense Conservative alternative to the online harms act is Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document>, proposed by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>. It would keep Canadians safe online without infringing on their civil liberties. It would give Canadians more protections online through existing regulators and the justice system, and would outline a duty of care for online operators to keep kids safe online while prohibiting a digital ID and giving parents more tools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756648"> For another outrageous example of withholding documents and censoring information, let us not forget the cover-up at the Winnipeg lab. The Liberals allowed scientists loyal to the Chinese Communist Party to work at our most secure lab. The Liberals gave them a Canadian taxpayer-funded salary and allowed them to send dangerous pathogens back to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where they work on gain-of-function research. When exposed, the Liberals, whom we know admire the basic dictatorship of China, let these scientists escape the country without proper investigation. When Parliament asked for these documents, the Liberals actually took their own Liberal Speaker to court and then censored our ability to disclose those documents by calling an early election. We still have not found out what happened there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756649">On top of censoring Parliament, let us not forget about the NDP-Liberal government's track record of censoring individual expression. We have seen countless individuals, physicians, scientists and organizations being punished for simply speaking out against the current government's policies. The government froze bank accounts. People were labelled as promoting hate speech and disinformation, or as conspiracy theorists, racists and misogynists, by their own <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756650">We were warned that this could happen. In one of his final interviews, esteemed scientist Carl Sagan noted, “We’ve arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756651">Who is running science and technology in a democracy if the people do not know anything about it? We have seen this technocracy weaponized by governments during the COVID pandemic through various unjustifiable mandates and government censorship surrounding medical research. Now, the new head of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, Marty Makary, has said on the record that the greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic was the United States government, and it is the same here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756652"> The weaponization of medical research is not just an American issue. Dr. Regina Watteel, a Ph.D. in statistics, has written, an excellent exposé on the rise of Canadian hate science. Her books expose how the Liberal government, through repeated grants from CIHR, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, hired Dr. David Fisman, a researcher for hire from the University of Toronto medical school, to manipulate COVID statistics to support a failing government policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756653">He was touted as an expert, but his only expertise was manipulating statistics to support government overreach. His sham studies were used to justify some of the most draconian COVID policies in the world and were quoted extensively by the Liberal-friendly media. Any criticism of Fisman's fraudulent statistical analysis has been shut down and censored. Again, this is a Canadian example of a result that Carl Sagan warned us about decades ago: the fall into technocracy, where government-sanctioned expert opinion trumps hard scientific data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756654"> Sadly, the government's censorship has now extended to our judicial systems and other institutions, including the Parole Board of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756655">While the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> brags about appointing 800 judges out of the 957 positions, we can see the soft-on-crime consequences of his woke ideological agenda. We saw an outrageous example of this last week when the French and Mahaffy families desired to participate in the parole hearing of their daughters' brutal murderer. Locally, Lisa Freeman, a constituent in Oshawa and the inspiration behind my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="12261841" Type="4">C-320</Document>, was recently informed by the Parole Board of Canada that the axe murderer who brutally murdered her father while on parole at the time will be subject to a closed-door review.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756656">In the past, Ms. Freeman has been denied her rights as a registered victim and, as a result, has been continually revictimized, only this time by the very institutions that should be putting her mental health and safety and the safety of victims first. Attending and meaningfully participating in an in-person hearing to deliver a victim statement is not only fair and reasonable, but well within Ms. Freeman's rights, as per the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights under the right of participation. It is crucial that Ms. Freeman be able to express the emotional pain and turmoil the murder of her father caused and continues to cause. She also deserves to be able to gauge for herself the accountability of the offender. This is something she has previously been unable to ascertain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756657">The brutal murder of her father has not only vastly impacted her life and the lives of her loved ones, but also continues to cause post-traumatic stress, which is exacerbated by the complete lack of care by the Parole Board of Canada for her rights as a victim. It is completely unacceptable that Ms. Freeman is once again being censored by the Parole Board of Canada as they plan to make a closed-door decision regarding the offender's continuation of day parole and full parole without holding a hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756658">It is shameful that the NDP-Liberal government seems to care more about censoring victims than keeping repeat offenders off the streets. What they do not understand is that government censorship does not fulfill the requirement of protecting people from harm in society. Instead, government censorship is the harm to society. It threatens our fundamental democratic values, which we should be championing. To quote the famous author, George Orwell, “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756659">The Marxist communist Vladimir Lenin once said, “Why should freedom of speech and freedom of press be allowed? Why should a government which is doing what it believes to be right allow itself to be criticized? It would not allow opposition by lethal weapons. Ideas are much more fatal things than guns. Why should any man be allowed to buy a printing press and disseminate pernicious opinions calculated to embarrass the government?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756660">More and more we are seeing these quotes and Marxist ideas implemented under the NDP-Liberal government. We must stand up for the idea that truth is not something that can be determined by the state. We must insist that Canadian citizens, not censoring politicians, should be the ones who decide what information they believe, what opinions and values they hold and with what content they engage. We must continue to reject the government's idea that censorship is the solution to every problem, though it may be the solution to their problems, and instead embrace the idea that freedom of expression and freedom of conscience are part of the solution of a more free and prosperous Canadian society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756661">Justice Potter Stewart said, “Censorship reflects a society's lack of confidence in itself. It is a hallmark of an authoritative regime”. That is what we see with the tired, divisive, Liberal government of today. Canadians have indeed lost confidence in the weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the corrupt Liberal Party. If we allow government to censor the rights of the people's elected representatives and the Internet; squash individuality, opinions and expression; and curtail our freedom of movement, then indeed the Marxists have won the ideological war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756662">In closing, Canada is not the greatest country in the world simply because I say it is. Canada is the greatest country in the world because we care and fight for our fundamental, democratic values. We have a history of that people from around the world in other countries would love to have, so these values must not be taken for granted. When we, in Oshawa, sing our national anthem, we take “The True North strong and free” to heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756663">The current SDTC scandal, with the refusal of the NDP-Liberal government to release the requested unredacted documents to the people's representatives, threatens the very essence of our democracy, which generations of Canadians died to protect and must be respected and fought for. At our cenotaphs, service clubs and in the sacred House of Commons, the people's voices will be heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756664">Canadians are listening today, and they have a core identity. We are proud Canadians. We are not the first post-national state. When people ask us which country we admire the most, we do not say that we admire the basic dictatorship of China. We say we admire Canada.</ParaText>

Instead of releasing them, the Liberals are making this debate go on and on. Each time they get up, instead of actually debating us on it, they bring up another issue. When I am talking about censorship and comparing us to other countries that are perhaps much more authoritarian, it is a warning because we are heading in that direction and Canadians do not want us going in that direction.</ParaText>

It showed the connection of Canada, China, the Wuhan lab and the world-wide pandemic. Now, that would really not be good for the Liberals' political fortune, because they had spent hundreds of billions of dollars on COVID. We are going to see how much of that was lining their own pockets and the pockets of those who were close to them. It was just a total disaster. Canada's debt doubled during that time.

              <ParaText id="8756738">What did the Liberals do in 2021? They did not want this information coming out, because it showed too much of a connection with the COVID virus coming from Wuhan to Canada. It did not look very good, but their polling numbers were looking good. They had said that they would not take advantage of a national emergency like COVID to call an election. However, what did they do? Well, they called an election in 2021, and that kind of closed the books on the procurement of documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756743">We have also seen that the per capita income in Canada has been stagnant since they have been in power, beginning 2015.

              <ParaText id="8756744"> That is not the case now. We are declining, year after year, in our standard of living in comparison to much of the world. We were one of the top six for many years, for decades. We are now, I do not know, maybe approaching number 30.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756745">That is after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has lost control of spending. A few weeks ago, the Parliamentary Budget Officer reported that the deficit will be $7 billion higher than the Liberal government's own $40-billion spending cap for this year alone. Liberals cannot control one year. It is just not in them. They just do not know how, it seems. That is serious, but it is an unserious government.</ParaText>

That has not been the case at all, for any of those years. We then have a quote from the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. They are two peas in a pod. She called Canada's current state a “vibecession”. That sounds like the disco days. No, this is economics. She said, “Canadians just aren't feeling that good”, which has caused them to slow down their spending, thereby causing vibecession. That is basically what she is saying. It is an insult.

If anybody looks at polling from the past year and a half, or even sneaks a peek, it is not going great for the Liberals. I know it is only a snapshot, but there have been lots of snapshots.

I think it is really important to talk a bit about the Canada-China foreign investment protection and promotion agreement that his former leader Stephen Harper signed with the Communist Chinese regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756755">The cozy Conservative-Communist coalition has actually led to a 31-year agreement. Stephen Harper went over to China, into Beijing, watched all the goose-stepping and celebrated the agreement. There are current Conservative members in this chamber today who are on the press releases and the contribution agreements, who were participating as Communist China was allowed to buy up Canadian companies, like Nexen and others. We were selling Canadian natural resources because the Liberals did not want Petro-Canada to exist; we sold it off under Paul Martin. We were then putting Canadian natural resources up for sale to Communist China.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756776"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the hard-working people of Flamborough—Glanbrook, who are struggling with the cost of living challenges, as are millions of Canadians across the country. Families are grappling with the skyrocketing cost of groceries, with rising interest rates on their mortgages, rents that have more than doubled since a decade ago and, of course, a jump in the gas price every time the carbon tax goes up. These are the real, tangible struggles Canadians and people in Flamborough—Glanbrook are facing every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756777">Amid these struggles, Canadians are learning more and more about yet another Liberal scandal through this debate. They are upset because they work hard for the tax dollars they send to this place and to the Government of Canada, and that money is clearly being wasted on mismanagement, insider deals and flagrant conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756778">They know that the $400 million in the SDTC scandal did not go to green technologies or innovations that will create jobs as the program was intended to do; rather, it went to those with Liberal connections. I would note that this is almost half a billion dollars. Canadians know it is part of a pattern with the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756779">We can contrast this with the case of a senior I spoke with about a month or so ago. He told me that, despite the good pension he receives from his years of work with a utility, he just had to take a part-time job to help make ends meet, to buy groceries. Grocery prices continue to rise because of the carbon tax. Of course, seniors on a fixed income are hit hardest by this. This is what makes the $400 million in the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund scandal so egregious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756780">This is not just a story of bad accounting; it is a story of betrayal. The SDTC fund was created with a noble purpose: to drive innovation, to support small businesses, to invest in sustainable technologies that could help Canada actually meet its emissions targets. This is unlike the carbon tax, which is only a tax grab and a tax plan. Instead, this program has become a glaring example of government mismanagement and misplaced priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756781">The Auditor General's investigation uncovered 186 conflicts of interest connected to SDTC, involving millions of dollars being funnelled to businesses tied to senior Liberal officials. This is not just negligence; it is systemic. The 186 conflicts of interest identified by the Auditor General are what we know about thus far. Surely, more conflicts will be identified in what has yet to be reviewed once these documents are released unredacted. The government needs to turn over the unredacted documents to the RCMP as asked by Parliament, the majority of members in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756782">Corruption does not just happen in a vacuum. It thrives where accountability is weak, where oversight is lacking and where governments forget their fundamental responsibility to the people they serve. The government's repeated ethical failures are not just individual lapses; they are symptoms of a deeper problem, a culture that prioritizes insiders and political optics over transparency and fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756783">It is taxpayer money being used to fund ineligible projects. These projects failed to meet basic criteria, overstated their environmental benefits or, worse, delivered no measurable outcomes at all. Can we believe that? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756784">Four hundred million dollars is not just a number. It represents real opportunities lost. It could have been used to equip hospitals with life-saving MRI machines. It could have been used to strengthen our border, to stop the flow of illegal guns that are threatening communities such as mine. I hear about this every day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756785">That $400 million could have gone toward supporting small businesses, helping them to adapt in what is clearly an increasingly challenging economy. Imagine if the wasted $400 million had been invested in infrastructure, repairing the aging bridges and roads that Canadians depend on every day. These are not just luxuries. These are lifelines for families to commute to work, for businesses to transport goods and for communities to stay connected. Instead, these funds were squandered, leaving Canadians to contend with potholes and gridlock while Liberal insiders reap the rewards</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756786">However, the SDTC scandal is not just a story of waste; it is also one of trust. Canadians are supposed to trust their government to act responsibly, to manage their tax dollars with care and to prioritize the public good, but with every scandal, that trust is eroded. When Parliament demanded transparency and demanded unredacted documents related to this scandal, the Liberal government's response was silence and then refusal, a blatant disregard for the will of Parliament and the trust of Canadians. That is why we are here again today continuing to debate this motion. The government could simply turn over the documents unredacted, which is what this Parliament, the majority of us members here, the representatives of the people who sent us to this place, asked for in June.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756787">I remember when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “sunshine is the [world's] best disinfectant”. What a stark difference after nine years. The consequences of this scandal strike to the very core of what it means to govern with integrity and accountability. Unfortunately, the mismanagement seen in the SDTC scandal is not an exception. Rather, it is emblematic of a troubling trend within the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756788"> Time and time again, we have witnessed decisions that prioritize political optics over meaningful outcomes, leaving Canadians to bear the cost. Nowhere is this pattern more evident than in the carbon tax, a policy that claims to address climate change but in reality disproportionately burdens Canadians while doing little to deliver tangible results. The senior I spoke to pays the price of that carbon tax, but we know, because just recently there was a report that Canada continues to be 62nd out of 67 countries in meeting our emissions targets, that the carbon tax is not an environment plan. It is a tax plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756789"> It is a tax, and since the carbon tax drives up prices across the board and fuels the cost of living crisis, it is even worse than that. Canadians are justifiably angry when they see this SDTC scandal and they see the Liberal government continue to tax them more and more, while Liberal insiders get away with lining their pockets through a government program. Canadians are footing the bill, and they are tired of footing the bill. The government continues to show its true priorities: protecting insiders, evading accountability and perpetuating a cycle of waste, mismanagement and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756790"> Let us talk about what the government's refusal to release documents related to the SDTC scandal really means. When Parliament demands transparency, it is exercising its duty to uphold accountability on behalf of the people who elected us, yet the government has chosen to ignore those demands. The Speaker of the House has ruled that parliamentary privilege was violated. This is not a minor infraction. This is a blatant disregard for the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756791"> What does the government have to hide? That certainly is the question that it begs. What are the Liberals so afraid of revealing in these documents? Canadians deserve to know the truth because they are paying the bills. They deserve to see how their hard-earned money is being spent.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756792"> The refusal to release the documents is not just a violation of privilege; it is also an insult to every Canadian who pays taxes and to every Canadian who expects integrity and accountability from their leaders. When a government wastes public funds, the impact is not just financial; it is also personal for Canadians. It undermines their confidence that their tax dollars are being used to create opportunities, to solve problems and to build a better future, and it deepens the frustration of the people who are already struggling to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756793">Since we are on the topic of tax dollars being wasted, and the findings of the Auditor General, there was another example yesterday in the Auditor General's report on the CEBA loans during the pandemic. The report says that another $3.5 billion was mismanaged by the Liberals. The Auditor General found that over 77,000 recipients of the Canada emergency business account program went to businesses that did not meet the eligibility requirements. That was another $3.5 billion in wasteful spending by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756794">It is no wonder that I hear from constituents in Waterdown, Binbrook, Mount Hope and in all of the communities throughout Flamborough—Glanbrook who are renewing their mortgage. Maybe they were on a fixed-term mortgage that has come up for renewal, or maybe they are on a variable mortgage. They are seeing higher interest rates. That, of course, has a huge impact when their monthly or biweekly payment is going to be more. It has a massive impact on their household budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756795">I remind constituents that this is the impact of government overspending, because we know from major banks that 2% of the interest rate increases, and therefore obviously 2% of the mortgage rate increases, is attributable to government overspending. Whether it is increased taxes or increased interest rates, it is Canadians who are paying the price when the Liberals try to sweep scandals like SDTC under the rug and continue the cover-up. People who are renewing mortgages in the communities in my riding pay the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756796">What is worse is that when governments waste tax dollars and evade transparency, they weaken the public's faith in our institutions. Accountability is not just a political talking point; it is the foundation of our healthy democracy. We must recommit ourselves to the values that Canadians hold dear: honesty, fairness and respect for the public trust, respect for tax dollars and the work that goes into providing them. The scandal represents more than just an ethical lapse; it is also a betrayal of the trust of Canadians in their government. It sends a dangerous message that accountability is optional, that rules are for others and that people in power can operate with impunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756797"> Sadly, this is not the first time we have seen this kind of behaviour from the Liberal government. It is part of a disturbing pattern. We can think back to the WE Charity scandal, where hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars were funnelled into an organization with deep connections to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family, or to the SNC-Lavalin affair, where senior officials attempted to interfere in a criminal prosecution to protect a politically connected corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756798">More recently, we can think back to the ArriveCAN app, which we know could have been produced by a couple of smart people in a basement, maybe over a case of beer. It started with an initial price tag of $80,000 but ballooned to an over $60-million fiasco. That is the amount we know about thus far; it could be more. The fiasco exposed yet another example of the government's inability or unwillingness to manage taxpayer dollars responsibly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8756799"> Of course, as my other colleagues have brought up, let us not forget about the Winnipeg lab cover-up. The government chose to prorogue Parliament rather than allow Canadians to know what really transpired in that lab. Time and time again, we see the government prioritize secrecy over accountability, insiders over taxpayers and political survival over the public good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756800">Let us also not forget that it was the ad scam scandal in the early 2000s that resulted in the Gomery inquiry that would eventually bring down the Liberal government of that day. It is worth noting that scandal involved $40 million. Today we are talking about the SDTC scandal that involves $400 million. It is ten times the size, yet the refusal to provide the documents is treated so casually. A $40-million scandal brought down a government. Today there is a $400-million scandal and a refusal to release the documents to the RCMP, as Parliament has ordered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756801">What was true then, in the early 2000s with ad scam, is true today. It is the same question: What do the Liberals have to hide? In each of these scandals I have mentioned, we see the same playbook: waste, secrecy and a refusal to be held accountable. Canadians who pay taxes are tired of it. They are tired of a government that prioritizes insiders over taxpayers, seeing the money they worked so hard for squandered on projects and programs that deliver little benefit. They are tired of bearing the cost of the government's failures through policies like the carbon tax and other taxes that are levied to pay for these wasteful spending. These unnecessary taxes, coupled with scandals like SDTC, create a perfect storm of financial strain and shattered trust. Canadians are left wondering, if the government can waste $400 million with no consequences, why should they believe any tax revenue is being used responsibly? It is not just about dollars and cents; it is about trust in government, leadership and the very institutions that are supposed to serve the people. When Canadians see a government that refuses to release the documents, hides behind excuses and repeatedly puts its friends and allies ahead of public good, that trust is eroded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756802">The impact of this serious erosion goes beyond politics and affects the very fabric of our democracy. It undermines the belief that government exists to serve the people, not the other way around. The government had the opportunity to do the right thing. It could have chosen transparency, acknowledged its mistakes and taken steps to rebuild trust. It could have released those documents, unredacted. It still can, but instead it continues to choose secrecy and defiance, further deepening the divide between itself and the Canadians it is supposed to represent. The cost of this distrust is more than just political; it leads to disengagement, skepticism and a growing belief that government itself is incapable of serving the public interest, which is why accountability and integrity matter. It is also why the Conservative Party will not stop fighting to restore these values to government. We will continue to demand answers, to hold the government accountable and to ensure the voices of Canadians are heard in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756803">The time for excuses is over. The time for accountability is now. It is not just about addressing one scandal, but addressing the culture of entitlement and mismanagement that has plagued the government for far too long. Canadians deserve better. They deserve a government that respects their hard-earned dollars, prioritizes their needs and upholds the principles of democracy and accountability. Conservatives stand ready to deliver that kind of leadership.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756814">Madam Speaker, I am back tonight to continue to call for action from the federal government in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, one that has been documented and affirmed by experts, including the University Network for Human Rights, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, and the UN special committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756815"> A few weeks ago, in question period, I spoke of an IDF missile strike that had burned Palestinians alive at a hospital tent camp. In the time since, Gaza now has the highest number of child amputees per capita in the world. More aid workers have been killed, and as a result, aid organizations like World Central Kitchen have had to pause their operations in Gaza altogether, while 1.1 million in Gaza face catastrophic hunger. UN officials say there are no safe areas in Gaza. Nearly 70% of the over 44,000 killed are women and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756816"> In the face of all of this, the world must not sit idly by. Canada must not sit idly by. Yet today, we remain complicit, and the calls to act continue to echo across the country. Just this morning, a hundred Jewish Canadians occupied the Confederation Building on Parliament Hill, demanding the Government of Canada end its complicity in this genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756817">Here are the words of one of the organizers, Niall Ricardo: “Our politicians cannot be complacent in these marble hallways while Israel continues to burn Palestinians alive in their tents”. Niall is right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756818"> Meanwhile, Dr. Mohammed Awad, coordinator of the Coalition of Canadian Palestinian Organizations, recently said at committee, “The Palestinian people have been failed several times, more and more by the international community and, unfortunately, by Canada as well.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756819"> There is much the Government of Canada could do today if it were serious about ending its complicity in this genocide. At the bare minimum, it could start by enacting a true two-way arms embargo on Israel and cancelling all active military export permits to the country. Second, Canada could, today, recognize the state of Palestine, which should be self-evident if Canada believes in, and it says it does by its foreign policy, a two-state solution. How can we possibly believe in a two-state solution if Canada does not affirm that one of the two states even exists? This, at a time when experts have shared at committee in recent months that it is an obviously critical step for peace and preservation in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756820"> Canada can and should call for an end to the occupation of Palestinian territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756821"> The government could fix the temporary resident visa program for Palestinian Canadian family members looking to get out of Gaza, following the recent Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East report showing this program was intended to fail. We could follow through on our Geneva Convention obligations, including preventing genocide. We could sanction extremist cabinet ministers who have said, for example, that starving civilians in Gaza might be justified, or that perpetrators of settler violence are heroes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756822"> Years from now, no doubt, politicians will come together to memorialize the genocide in Gaza, but more important than those words of memoriam in future years is action right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756823">Tonight I ask the parliamentary secretary, again, when will the government's actions align with its words when it says, “Never again”? </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756824">Madam Speaker, I will begin by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="278717" Type="2">Kitchener Centre</Affiliation> for his question and his ongoing attention to this subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756825"> We too share the member's immense sense of grief, and our hearts break for the tragic loss of civilian life in Israel and Gaza. In particular, we grieve for the children, who have been disproportionately affected by this ongoing conflict. However, let us also acknowledge that this debate is taking place after a ceasefire was secured between Israel and Hezbollah. Though we remain horrified by the loss of civilian life in Lebanon and northern Israel, this ceasefire is the product of tireless and creative diplomacy. As our world becomes increasingly unstable, direct diplomatic engagement remains the most productive tool in building peace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756826">Of course, the horrific attacks by Hamas against Israeli citizens on October 7 still shock us all. We continue to condemn Hamas, a listed terrorist organization, unequivocally. We will never forget the pain and suffering caused by its heinous acts of violence. Canada also condemns Hamas's unacceptable treatment of hostages. We continue to call for not only the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining hostages but also the return of the bodies of hostages killed in Gaza. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756827">What has been happening in Gaza is catastrophic. The humanitarian situation was already dire. Civilians in Gaza have nowhere else to go and, as the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has said, asking them to move again is unacceptable. The violence must stop. Canada has been calling for an immediate, sustainable ceasefire for months, but this cannot be one-sided; Hamas must lay down its arms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756828">Humanitarian aid must also be urgently increased and sustained. The need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza has never been greater. Rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief must be provided to civilians. Canada was the first G7 country to act, and we will continue to work with partners towards ensuring sustained access to humanitarian assistance for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel, shelter and access for humanitarian workers. Today, Canada has announced $215 million in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of vulnerable civilians in this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756829">When it comes to UNRWA, we understand the vital role it plays in delivering aid to Palestinian civilians. Legislation passed by the Israeli government aimed at revoking the privileges and immunities of UNRWA is cause for grave concern. It is also critical that UNRWA continue its reform program, demonstrate its commitment to the principle of neutrality and ensure that its activities remain entirely in line with its mandate. We continue to urge the Israeli government to abide by its international obligations and allow for the full, rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the unfolding tragedy. Canada's commitment to life-saving humanitarian aid remains unwavering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756830"> We condemn the killing of civilians in Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. We continue to insist that civilians be protected. Attacks on hospitals, aid delivery sites and refugee camps have caused the deaths of dozens of civilians seeking refuge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756831"> When it comes to South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice, the court has been clear on the provisional measures. Israel must ensure the delivery of basic services and essential humanitarian assistance, and it must protect civilians. The court's decisions on provisional measures are binding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756832">We have also seen the expansion of settlements accelerating in the West Bank as settler violence continues. We continue to respond to the urgent needs—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8756838">Madam Speaker, a CBC story last week listed the 10 top U.S. imports from Canada in 2023. It totalled $340 billion. Oil, gas and petroleum products made up $160 billion of that, which is 48%. Agricultural products made up $30 billion, which is 10%. Agricultural products depend a lot on oil, gas and petroleum products when we are talking about fertilizer and machinery. Transportation equipment made up $74 billion, which is 25%. Transportation equipment is steel, metal and all sorts of things made from the resource sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756839">This is a tremendous amount of export to a country that is looking for self-sufficiency in North America, and it comes from Canada. A lot of it comes from Canadian exports. We are over 50%. Does the U.S. have a cap on emissions and a cap on oil and gas production now? No, it does not. Has the President-elect indicated he would put an emissions cap on oil and gas production? No. He is looking to expand their oil and gas production, and he is looking for more from his biggest trading partner in oil and gas: Canada. That is why we need North American energy security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756840">However, the cap would cause a reduction in oil of one million barrels per day by 2030, with an additional cut of one million barrels per day by 2035. This cap on oil emissions is a cap on responsible Canadian oil production, jobs and paycheques. In Alberta, we are talking about a reduction of 92,000 jobs. We are talking about $12 billion in government revenues lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756841"> The Conference Board of Canada think tank estimates the cap would reduce Canada's GDP by $1 trillion by 2030. That is a loss of 151,000 jobs across Canada by 2030, slowing the GDP by 2030 from 15.3% to 14.3%. Deloitte estimates Alberta will see 3.6% less investment, which is a 4.5% decrease in the province's economic output. Also, Ontario would lose 15,000 jobs and $2.3 billion from its economy. Quebec would even lose thousands of jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756842">I know my colleagues across the way have often talked about other forms of energy production. There are solar and wind. I have the largest ones in Canada in my riding for solar and wind energy production. The Liberals were complaining about the premier putting in a moratorium. They did a six-month review and in one of the reviews, it said not to build them on irrigated land, which there is a lot of in my riding because that is for crops, yet I still have the largest ones in Canada in my riding. The other day at seven o'clock in the morning, there were no sunlight rays hitting solar panels, no wind moving and not one iota of power was coming out of solar or wind that morning. At seven o'clock in the morning, there was nothing. What supplied it? Natural gas was supplying the energy we needed in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756843">With respect to the products it takes to make solar and wind energy, we are talking about steel, we are talking about aluminum and we are talking about plastics. All those things to make solar and wind energy come from the resource industry, other than glass. Now here is an interesting thing about glass: It takes sand. It takes a specific kind of sand. National Geographic reports that China is destroying estuaries all over the world as mining companies get that best small, round sand to make glass. It is not the stuff in the deserts, which is rough. From the National Geographic research—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756846">I would like to begin with the point that emissions in Canada are on their way down. That is a good thing. When the Liberals first formed government, emissions were tracking upward and there was no path to bring them down. Today, our emissions are lower than they have been in almost three decades.</ParaText>

In fact, we see time and time again that we are developing that important know-how.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756848">If we want to look at examples of how we are supporting great energy projects right here in our country, we do not have to look any further than the Oneida battery project with Six Nations not far from Toronto. It is kind of in southern Ontario. It will be one of the largest battery projects in all of North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756849">It was created with the help of the Canada Infrastructure Bank and the federal government. It ensures we are working as a partnership. It is a question of reconciliation but it is also about how we create that battery storage for the days the member opposite was bringing up, where maybe there is less sun and less wind. We do have those other solutions and the world is looking for those other energy solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756850">That is why we have worked with Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia to develop an offshore wind industry. We have created changes in the Atlantic accords to make that happen. That is what they were looking for from us. Time and time again, we are working to make sure that Canada is at the forefront of fighting climate change and that we are on track to meet our targets. We are, by the way, on track to meet our interim targets for 2026. The oil and gas emissions cap will help us to be on track to meet our further targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756851">We need to take these actions. We need to do it for our economy. We need to do it for our planet.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756853">I will talk specifically about the carbon tax and the sugar beet industry in Canada. We now have one place left in Canada that refines sugar. We need sugar. It is a growing industry in our country. In Ontario, we grow about 10,000 tonnes of sugar beet. It is trucked to Michigan. Where is the carbon tax sense in that? It is an industry we have in southern Alberta, but with the carbon tax, it is getting so expensive to grow, to truck and to have it done as it should be so we retain this part of our industry in Canada. It is important, but the carbon tax makes it so difficult for us to compete in the world market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756854">That is an industry we need in southern Alberta. This is an industry we need for Canada. The carbon tax threatens it.</ParaText>

I got to go to Redpath Sugar and look at the improvements that are being made with federal support from Agriculture Canada to help it reduce its energy costs and energy needs so it is more efficient. It actually is helping its bottom line. It was also helping make a safer environment for its workers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756857"> Madam Speaker, I rise today to have a chance to address, once again, the government's emissions cap, which is better known as its production cap, because we know that, by implementing the emissions cap, we are going to see a reduction of about a million barrels of oil in production in Canada by 2030. There have been various reports that have been done on this that show this is going to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756858">One of the strategic advantages that Canada has enjoyed for the last number of decades has been our reliable, affordable and efficient energy production. That has been done largely through the oil and gas sector that we have here in Canada. Let us also talk about some of the benefits that our communities receive from the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756859">When we look at communities around southwest Saskatchewan, for example, the town of Shaunavon has the Crescent Point Wickenheiser Centre, which has a community skating rink, the curling rink, meeting rooms and event spaces. In Kindersley, Inter Pipeline just entered into a 10-year partnership to be the naming rights sponsor for the event centre arena, which supports the minor hockey program there, as well as the Kindersley Klippers in the SJHL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756860">Just last month, in my hometown of Swift Current, Whitecap Resources made a $100,000 commitment toward the Southwest Facility Foundation, which is going to be a new multi-purpose facility that we are looking to build in Swift Current. Beyond that, we can look at the Dr. Noble Irwin Regional Healthcare Foundation with the various donors who are on the list and the various businesses that are donating to the success of health care all across southwest Saskatchewan. Particularly in Swift Current, we see people who are entrepreneurs in the oil and gas sector. We see the small businesses that are operating in the service industry. They are the ones who are donating to these causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756861">When we look at our minor sports teams, when we look at the boards of people who have donated, who are either platinum, gold or silver sponsors of minor sports, whether it is hockey or baseball, again, it is energy companies that are the ones leading the charge on making donations to minor sports, to minor hockey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756862">For senior centres, schools and education, it is these companies that are the ones putting their dollars into these facilities and into the various courses and classes that are available. These are the companies that need to be supported, but these are the companies that the Liberal government is deliberately attacking and is trying to wipe out with its draconian policies, such as the emissions cap, which, as I said, is a production cap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756863">Let us look further at what is going to happen here. In these reports, which I referenced earlier, 150,000 jobs are expected to be lost because of the emissions cap. When we look at the average salary in the oil and gas sector, it is over $151,000, which is 2.4 times greater than the average salary across the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756864">In 2030, when this emissions cap is fully implemented, we are going to see a drop of $34.5 billion in economic potential in Canada. When we game that out, that averages out to a drop of $420 per month for the average family across the country in disposable income. That is going to be the result and the track record of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756865"> I do not know why Liberals are so committed to trying to devastate the Canadian economy. They know that the natural resource sector, particularly the oil and gas sector, is the driver of the Canadian economy. It is what produces good jobs. It is the industry that is the single largest investor in renewable energy in this country. That is who they are directly assaulting.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756866"> Madam Speaker, I am not even sure how to fully respond to the speech I just heard, which was a list of the donations made by the oil and gas industry to the member's community. That is great. I just do not really know how to respond to that, except to say that in my community, local sports are supported by many different community organizations and businesses, and I thank them very much for their support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756867">I do not think that this is actually what we are supposed to be debating today. I do not think that this is necessarily the most important issue that we have to talk about. I think the most important issue that we have to talk about, and the member opposite did touch on this as well, is the future for our economy, our environment and our planet, here in this country and around the world. I think that one of the things that frustrates me sometimes is that there is not enough focus, as well, on all of the opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756868">It is so frustrating to always be talking in the negative. There are opportunities and the world is looking to us for those opportunities. In fact, Romania, wanting to make sure that it can stay away from Russian oil, turned to Canada. We are providing expertise in providing more nuclear support and building out nuclear energy more. That is something that we can provide. When we look at other places where we are working with our allies, we have the know-how and the go-to. That is something that we need to be continuing to bring forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8756869">Just recently, I got to go to the graduation of the first all-female class of new millwrights, who will be working at the Darlington refurbishment. There is a great opportunity there for good-paying union jobs for these women coming out of the program. There are opportunities, and we need to be seizing them. At the same time, we need to be fighting climate change because that is the most existential threat for our planet. Let us do both. Let us stop focusing on the negative. Let us look at all that we can achieve. That is, in fact, what we are doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756870">Madam Speaker, I am not sure why she says we should not focus on the negative. She says we should not focus on the loss of $35 billion from the Canadian economy, the drop in GDP that is going to happen on this or the 150,000 job losses that are going to come about because of the emissions cap. That is what she does not want to focus on. She does not want people to know about these kinds of things. She is going to talk about the environment, saying that we have to do so much for the environment. Oil and gas companies have been leading the charge in investments in trying to reduce their methane emissions. They have been working on efficiencies. Over the years, they have actually decreased emissions in their sector on their own, without government mandates. They have been the single biggest driver in making sure that the most ethical, highest standards are met in Canadian oil and energy but that this is also done in a way that it is still affordable for Canadians to have reliable energy. This is the strategic advantage that Canada has, but the Liberal government wants to make it go away. It is a shame.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8756871"> Madam Speaker, I am trying not to talk down our economy, because I know we can accomplish so much more. What we should also know is that the oil and gas sector is Canada's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and that the emissions from that part of the sector continue to grow. I do not even understand what the confusion is about why we should have a cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector. Pathways originally said that they were on track, that they wanted to do the very same thing, so where is the argument? We need to do this for our economy and for the environment.</ParaText>
