            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278444" Type="2">Mr. Larry Maguire (Brandon—Souris, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8645701"> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in the House this morning to continue to talk about the ethical failures of the Liberal government. I will start where I left off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645702">The <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation> also violated ethics rules by awarding untendered contracts directly from her office to her close friend and campaign manager. She too was found in violation of ethics rules, yet we hear very little from the Liberals about these repeated breaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645703">Many Canadians are rightly concerned about the recurring pattern of law-breaking within the Liberal government. It is well known that there have been multiple violations of ethics and other laws. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own parliamentary secretary at the time was found guilty of breaking ethics laws, along with several current and former Liberal MPs, who used their offices to benefit themselves, their family members and their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645704">We are currently witnessing yet another scandal, this time involving the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">employment minister</Affiliation>, a Liberal cabinet member from Edmonton, and his pandemic profiteering business partner. This scandal is so serious that it has prompted a ruling from the Speaker on the right of democratically elected members to receive full, honest answers and information from individuals summoned by the House. In this particular case, the business partner of the Liberal minister from Edmonton Centre refused to provide crucial information about an individual referred to as “the other Randy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645705"> Why is this significant? It is because it strikes at the core of a scandal involving a sitting cabinet minister who, while serving in government, held a 50% stake in a company that was awarded government contracts by his own government. This is not just unethical; it is deeply concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645706">What exacerbates the situation is that the minister claimed he had no contact with his business partner throughout 2022, a key year in the timeline. He even testified to this in the House. His business partner echoed the same claim. However, what did we discover when the documents were produced? They had been texting and communicating throughout that entire year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645707">This is the clear problem: The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s testimony was not truthful and his business partner's testimony was not truthful. They misled the House, the public and the media. Now we know that instead of working for Canadians, this sitting Liberal cabinet minister was actively managing the day-to-day operations of a company profiting from pandemic contracts awarded by his own government. This is the kind of corruption that has brought the House to a standstill. It is about conflicts of interest and a blatant refusal to follow the law. Canadians are expected to follow the law. Why not the Liberals?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645708">Canadians have had enough, and they are demanding that the RCMP fully investigate these scandals. A letter from the RCMP dated October 9 states, “the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into SDTC is ongoing.” We know that SDTC operated under various governments, including that of Stephen Harper. However, according to Canada's Auditor General, it faced no issues until 2017. It was after 2017, when the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed his own choice as chair of SDTC, that the problems began.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645709">What happened next? The most ethically challenged <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has allowed corruption to fester within the government, appointed his hand-picked chair to oversee SDTC. It is no surprise that we have now seen 186 conflicts of interest and $400 million in mismanaged funds. The Auditor General's report only examined a portion of the deals made under the billion-dollar slush fund, and she found conflicts of interest in 80% of the cases that were reviewed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645710"> The Liberals continue to claim that they are hiding the truth to protect charter rights, but as the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> rightly pointed out, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is designed to protect citizens from the government, not to provide cover for the government to withhold documents from the people. We must uphold the supremacy of Parliament. Parliament, with its elected representatives of Canadians, writes the rules, creates laws and directs our justice system, not the other way around, yet the Liberals are constantly attempting to distort this fundamental truth.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645713">This is absolutely correct. The Liberals have not attempted to comply with the Auditor General's report. They have ignored the recommendations of the industry committee and continue to refuse to comply with the House's order to produce the documents essential to uncovering the truth about how their friends and Liberal insiders are getting rich while ordinary Canadians continue to struggle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645714">The RCMP will continue its investigation, but it is crucial that it receives all the necessary materials to complete its work. What can we expect from the Liberal government? It will claim it wants this matter referred to a committee, but instead of tabling the documents, it wants the committee to study whether the documents should even be tabled in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645715">The House has already ordered the production of these documents. That decision was made by a majority of MPs, yet the Liberals, with their shrinking support, refuse to comply. They are hiding behind redactions and claims of cabinet confidence, but Canadians see through this charade. The Liberals are playing a dangerous game with our democracy, and if they are willing to violate this law, what other laws might they be willing to break?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8645718">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>not only has failed to lead by example when it comes to ethical behaviour, but has also shown himself unable to ensure that a high ethical bar is met within the government he runs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645719">The complete disregard he has shown for the will of the House is not surprising. Time and time again, he has doubled down in the midst of scandals instead of fessing up and delivering good, honest government to Canadians. It has certainly been interesting to hear that some of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own Liberal MPs are finally getting fed up with a Prime Minister who dismissed their concerns and whose leadership has been continuously scandal-plagued. Their concerns echo the sentiments of many Canadians who, after nine years of the Prime Minister, are tired of higher costs, increased crime and government corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645720">We have already witnessed the government repeatedly breach the Conflict of Interest Act. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, ministers, Liberal MPs and insiders have violated the very rules designed to protect Canadians from this type of corruption. Enough is enough. Canadians deserve transparency, they deserve accountability and they deserve a government that upholds the law. It is time for the Liberals to stop playing games with our democracy, hand over the documents and allow the RCMP to complete its investigation. Only common-sense Conservatives will end the corruption and get answers for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8645721">Mr. Speaker, the member talked about corruption. The most corrupt prime minister that Canada has ever seen is likely Stephen Harper. In fact, he is the only prime minister in the history of Canada who has been found in contempt of Parliament. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> today was his parliamentary secretary. No one was a stronger advocate for Stephen Harper than the leader of the Conservative Party, who sat around the cabinet table. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645722">Having said that, nothing has changed. Today, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, unlike the NDP leader, the Green Party leader and the Bloc leader, says he does not need to get a security clearance. Why should the leader of the Conservative Party not get the security clearance that would enable him to find out what is happening with foreign interference? What is the leader of the Conservative Party hiding?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8645728">Mr. Speaker, I certainly do see a link. The situation my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> pointed out is that, at the time, the government was completely against my bill. Once it was implemented on the night it passed in the Senate, it became immediate law. However, it has been used across Canada for the last three years and nothing has happened to the tax system in Canada, other than putting people who were jeopardized on the same level as those selling their small businesses to their family, as opposed to a complete stranger, and getting a benefit for selling it to a complete stranger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645729">The member pointed out that the government was against it, and all of a sudden it was for it when we called an emergency meeting. He pointed out that the government had not been in favour of it for, I think, over 550 days, and I remember his speech well in the committee we had that day. There is a link and it is ongoing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645730">In my speech, I pointed out the plethora of scandals the government has had. It took most of the time of my presentation, for sure, and that should take care of the concerns of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, who I think is a little jittery about his own seat. </ParaText>

We know that if the Liberals get it into committee, they will try to squelch, or maybe squander, the information that would be there for the public to see. Some of the information has already been heavily redacted. They could quite easily put it in the committee and then adjourn it, which would end the whole charade. They would want that. </ParaText>

We all know the RCMP can get access to any documents and has a legal process for doing so.

Then we went through the ad scam situation for 40 million dollars' worth of scandal, and this is $400 million. To put everything into perspective, at a time when Canadians are struggling with gas and groceries and heating their homes, we have a $400-million scandal going on.

              <ParaText id="8645744">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have a proud motto, “Je me souviens”, or “I remember”. I would like to remind members of some historical facts about the Conservative Party, and especially what our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278428" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> just mentioned, which also highlights the 25 years of service of our colleague from Brandon—Souris.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645745">Members will recall that there certainly was corruption when the Conservative Party was in power. Former Conservative minister Tony Clement misappropriated funds, and not just $10 million, $20 million, $30 million or $40 million. He misappropriated $50 million, funnelling it directly to his riding. Members will also recall the corruption scandal involving robocalls. A member of the Conservative Party served nine months in prison for giving false information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645746">Therefore, I would like my colleague to explain why Quebeckers should trust a Conservative government, which has betrayed people's trust in the past.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8645747"> Mr. Speaker, I think Quebec has done very well being a member of Confederation. Under former Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney, the Conservatives did an excellent job of bringing Canadians together instead of separating us. It was a great time in Canadian history, when free trade benefited Quebec as much as it did anywhere else in Canada. I spent a couple of hours last evening with an old friend of mine, Lance Yohe, who was the executive director of the Red River Basin Commission for years and is now a member of the International Joint Commission. These are the kinds of relationships that we need to build. We do not need separation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8645748"> Mr. Speaker, it is great to see a packed House here this morning to listen to me speak. I am really excited about that. I am always honoured to speak in front of my colleagues, so it is great to be here this morning. Unfortunately, it is such a sad occasion, with what we are talking about. I would love to be talking about housing. I would love to be talking about crime, for sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645749">In fact, in my riding of Prince Albert yesterday, there was an emergency notice. Somebody was shot while someone was stealing his truck. My thoughts go out to his family. These are serious events and serious things that we should be talking about, and we could be talking about them, if the Liberals would only provide the evidence as the Speaker has instructed them to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645750">I got elected in 2008. I remember back in 2008, my colleague LaVar Payne, the member for Medicine Hat, had a heckle. His heckle was really simple: “Where is the $40 million?” During question period, the Liberals would try to say something distinguishable and he would just say, “Where is the $40 million?” Then the Liberals would shrink down in their seats and shrug away. They could not answer his question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645751">He did that for a year and a half or two years. We never did find out where that $40 million went to and how the Liberals took that money and used it for their own personal benefit. That was never really ever accounted for. That money just disappeared, and the Liberals shrugged their shoulders, and on we went. In the meantime, I think they went down to 12 seats, just marginal numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645752">Canadians were mad at the Liberal Party of Canada for what they had done. They kicked them out. They put in an honourable prime minister, former prime minister Stephen Harper. We saw our economy turn around. We saw strong management through a fiscal crisis in the global recession. We saw growth in our communities, even during the global recession. We saw lift stations. We saw water treatment plants. We saw bridges. We saw the Canada West Foundation, through which we built infrastructure in western Canada in the ports. We were actually growing as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645753">By 2015, we were experiencing that boom of growth because of that solid stewardship of the economy and the responsible use of taxpayers' dollars. I could do an announcement in my riding, and I would know that I would be able to touch what was going to be built. If we said we were going to spend $20 million on a water treatment plant, like we did in Prince Albert, I could take members there to show them that water treatment plant and its benefits. When we did bridges, we could drive a car across the bridge once it was completed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645754">Those are the things Canadians want us to do. They want responsible use of their funds. If they are going to trust us with their money, then we have a duty to ensure that we handle it with respect and dignity, and that we take their trust seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645755">LaVar was asking about $40 million. Roughly 18 years later, it is $400 million. Why have the Liberals not learned their lesson? We would think they would have learned that that is a lot of money. They should not be taking that from taxpayers and abusing taxpayers' trust. That is what they have done with this $400-million fund. It is disgusting because, like I said, we could be talking about or debating things like housing. How many kids are living in their parents' basement right now? Did we talk about that this week? No.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645756">We could be talking about crime. We could be talking about what we need to do to get serious about repeat offenders. We could be talking about how to deal with auto thefts. We could be talking about how to put violent offenders behind bars to make sure they do not get out and repeat offend. We could be talking about what we can do to stop crime. We could be talking about addictions and mental health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645757">These are all things Canadians want us here to talk about at this time because these are things they are concerned about, but we are talking about the fact that the Liberals are snubbing Parliament. They are ignoring a direct order from the Speaker. The Speaker should be really upset, and I know he is upset because they are challenging his authority over this body by not providing those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645758">What do they do? They shrug. Their arrogance shows up. They just say, “We do not care about Parliament.” That is obvious because they did not care about the $400 million either. They just went and spent it as they wanted to spend it for their purposes, not for taxpayers' purposes. This resonates right through the whole government and how it conducts its business. It has never been about the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645759">It has never been about how it can help the people in British Columbia or help the people in Quebec. It has never been about how it can help the people in Atlantic Canada, how it can get them more prosperity and raise their standard of living. Let us look at what has happened under the current government. Look at our GDP. Look at our standing in the G7. They are embarrassing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645760">We have known for years now that the port of Vancouver is one of the worst ports in the world. What has the government done? Has it invested in the port? Has it made changes? Has it looked at it and actually done a study to say these types of actions would make this port the best in the world? No.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8645761"> They say that it is good enough and that we are okay being at the bottom of the list. That is fine. Canadians do not think that is fine. Canadians are upset about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645762">Let us circle back to the $400 million that was squandered. I would like to say stolen, but I do not think that is parliamentary, so I will call it squandered. Just think of what we could do with that $400 million. How many police officers and how many RCMP officers could we put across Canada with $400 million? If we think about that, it would be quite a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645763">We can think about how we could improve trade with $400 million or how we could make our infrastructure and supply chains more efficient with the proper investment of $400 million. In fact, if we did that with the private sector, that $400 million of investment could probably become $1.2 billion of actual investment on the ground to help Canadians, improve Canadians' lives for the future and beyond, and address issues for their kids and their grandkids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645764">What did the Liberals do? They squandered it. They ignored any type of governance. They put themselves in direct conflict of interest. The Auditor General said that 186 direct conflicts of interest showed up in her study. We can think about it: 186 conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645765">These are professional people managing a big fund and they did not understand governance. I am sorry, but I do not buy that. How did they not understand conflict of interest? If they were not sure, there is a person called the Ethics Commissioner. They could phone them to receive all sorts of advice on conflict of interest. There are all sorts of people and that is what they do. They help boards to avoid situations such as this if there is a desire within that group to maintain purity in how they dispense that cash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645766">If they had done what they were supposed to do with it, we would probably be better off. Maybe that fund would have been a really good working fund. Maybe it would have had objectives that would have been met. However, they decided to ignore that. They ignored it willingly. In fact, their due diligence was lacking. If we were in the private sector, and we had shareholders, and they had seen this type of activity, I do not think they would get board of directors insurance, first of all. Second, I think the shareholders would sue them for neglect of the asset that they owned shares in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645767">What did the government do? It probably gave them a bonus because they like doing that with other executives, such as those at the CBC. We give them bonuses when they do not meet their objectives, but that is fine. We will just give them money. That is good. It is all good. There is no problem, right? There is no problem. It is not my dollar. However, that is the problem. It is not my dollar. They need to understand that it is not their dollar. It is the taxpayers' dollar. It is given to us in trust to make good decisions with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645768">Again, to come back to that $400 million, what could I do with that? That is a huge amount of money. That is crazy. It is actually so big that Canadians cannot get their heads around it. It is also a little bit surprising because they cannot believe that anybody would be that arrogant to try to get away with this. They cannot believe that the government would be willing to back and protect these people by not providing the evidence and not letting the RCMP do its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645769">What is the arrogance in that scenario? What are the Liberals saying to Canadian taxpayers? They are saying to not worry, that it is fine, to look the other way. Do not worry about it. It is fine. It is good that our kid lives with us in the basement. It is better for our family. It is all good. Seriously, this is what the Liberals are thinking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645770">When these people were sitting around the table looking at projects, there were probably some really good projects that they could have funded, but because it did not belong to a Liberal or it did not belong to one of their own companies or a friend of theirs, it got ignored. It is shameful. It is darn right shameful. It is darn right maddening because, if we were doing our job right, if we had put a group together to manage a fund like this and it had done its job, it could have really done some amazing things because that is a lot of money, but it did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645771">We are now here today. Instead of talking about housing, crime or what we could do to fix the budget, balance the budget and bring our house in order, what are we doing? We are talking about the NDP-Liberals' inability or unwillingness to listen to the Speaker and take his orders seriously to provide the documents to the RCMP. I cannot believe this. I cannot believe that they have let this go on. This is very simple to fix. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645772">Do members know that Paul Martin, during the ad scam, at least brought together a group that addressed it? It was not pretty for him. It was probably very uncomfortable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8645773">I will give him credit. At least he did the honourable thing and tried to address it. They changed financier and they brought in Ralph Goodale. He was trying to get to the bottom of it too. I give him credit for trying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645774">The Liberals are not even trying. They do not want to try. They want to play conquer and divide. They want to shine a light over here and say there is nothing to look at, so move on. That is so sad because Canadians have had enough of that type of activity here in Ottawa. That is why the Conservative Party is sitting at 42% in the polls. It is because Conservatives are talking to people. We are listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645775">Canadians are saying they want the Conservatives to deal with the housing crisis. They want us to deal with crime. They want us to make sure their taxes are being spent properly. They want us to make sure they have proper health care and proper funding of health care. How many MRI scanners could we buy with $400 million? How many hospital beds could have been opened up with $400 million? What other benefits could we have provided Canadians with for $400 million? Again, if we use our imagination, it could help a substantial amount of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645776">I go back to Mr. Payne. I am sure he is sitting somewhere shaking his head and saying, “A Liberal is a Liberal is a Liberal is a Liberal.” I still remember coming here with a former MLA from Alberta before I was elected. We were with the wheat growers and the barley growers. He sat down with the parliamentary secretary of agriculture, who is the former member for Malpeque, Mr. Easter, who I think is a fairly honourable person. I enjoyed working with him, and I wish him well in his retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645777">I remember Mr. Strankman saying to Mr. Easter, as they were finishing up their meeting and shaking hands, “Wayne, it is getting really tough to see the difference between a Liberal and a criminal here in Ottawa.” I know Mr. Easter took it to heart. I know he was upset, rightly so, but I do not think he was mad at Mr. Strankman. I think Mr. Easter was mad at his own party. I think he was mad at the people who were pulling off this crap. I think he knew what was going on, or had suspicions of what was going on, and could not fix it himself. He wanted to see change, but he was handcuffed because he could not do it. He knew it was going to hurt him. He knew it was going to hurt him both electorally and reputation-wise. He was not mad at the comment. He was mad that people were actually telling him what he already knew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645778">There should be Liberal members over there saying the same thing. They should be mad. Maybe 24 Liberal members are mad. Maybe that is part of the reason they want a different leader. They are looking at this and saying not another one. When they go to caucus and want to ask questions, they are told they did not make the list this week. When they ask about the next week, they are told they are probably not going to make the list next week either. Can a member ask a question about bubble gum? Sure, they can put that on the list. They can come up to the mike and the Liberal caucus will talk about bubble gum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645779"> That is what is going on and that is why we see discontent among the Liberal Party. Its members are being ignored. I believe there are some hon. members over there who would actually like to see this dealt with and would like to get to the bottom of this. However, the leadership team is so heavily involved with it and the friends of the leadership team may end up going to jail if it was investigated. I think we should give them the evidence to see what the court would decide. That would be the honourable way of doing it. If the court says, “No, these people are innocent,” I guess we will have to accept that. However, the court might come back and say, “Yes, this is corruption. This is illegal.” There are consequences to that. That is what should happen then. It is really sad that the voice is not being heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645780">The Conservatives have been giving everybody the opportunity to do the right thing here. We have been talking to people here. We have been trying to be progressive and conciliatory, but we cannot forsake our values. We cannot let corruption go on. We cannot sit here and not call it out when we see it so blatantly. We cannot let the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has had unethical breaches over and over again, get away with another one, nor can we let him throw somebody else under a bus, like he has done in the past with different cabinet ministers. The ministers tend to be female, by the way, which is very disconcerting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645781">I will go back to Saskatchewan, as I talked a bit about what happened yesterday. People are sitting there. They have been told to stay home. They were told to lock up and to not pick up strangers. Those are scary things and they are happening way too often. People are upset. We should be talking about that today. We should be talking about how to prevent that from happening in the future. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8645782"> It is really interesting, and interesting may not be the right word, that this has been going on as long as it has. As far as I am concerned, it will continue to go on until the Liberals do the right thing. They know what the right thing is. They have to provide the documents. They have to respect your judgment. If they are not going to respect your judgment now, what happens tomorrow? If you make a judgment tomorrow and they do not respect you tomorrow or the day after, what does that mean? When does Parliament cease to function? When does Parliament actually not operate the way it is intended to operate? That is what is starting to be at stake here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645783">We are no longer a Parliament that actually debates back and forth. We go to committees and have debates back and forth, bring in experts and witnesses, listen to their advice, produce a proper report, table it in Parliament and get a response from the government. Parliament has not been doing that now for about three weeks. It is embarrassing. The Liberals need to do the right thing so that Parliament can get back on track to do what it needs to do. There are still things that need to be done. If they cannot do that and if they think this is okay, it is not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645784">They have one other option that would be honourable, and that is to go to the polls, to go to the Governor General, dissolve Parliament and have a carbon tax election. That is an option that they should strongly consider. If they think that they are so right, if they think their actions are so honourable and that Canadians do not care, then let us put it to Canadians. Let us ask them directly through a vote. That is really the ultimate in democracy. I think Canadians would be very concerned if Parliament was sliding back and not functioning. The honourable thing for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would be to go to the Governor General, dissolve Parliament, call an election and let the people decide. That is something that would be an end to all the stories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645785">The Liberals have some options. They can take the documents, go to the RCMP, give it the boxes, step back and let it do its work. If there are criminal charges, let them progress. If it goes to court, let the courts do what they do. If they are found innocent, they are found innocent. I do not think they will be, but I am not going to prejudge it. If they are found guilty, then there are consequences to be paid. That is one option. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645786">The second option is to dissolve Parliament, go to the Governor General, put it in front of the people of Canada and let them decide. They can tell the Liberal Party and the members here what they think should happen. The people of Canada can speak, and they are the best spokesmen and the best judges that we have for our Parliament in a democracy. Let us go to them. Let us put it in front of them, even though they will not see all of the information, because the Liberals will still hide it, but at least they would look at the consequences and the things that are surrounding the decision that has been made here. They would look at the way Parliament is not functioning and they would make the changes they see fit, but they would make the changes so that Parliament operates again, so that it gets back to talking about housing, crime, affordability and the things they really are struggling with. We could talk about the cost of groceries and the cost of basic necessities. Those are the things that they want us to be talking about today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645787">Canadians are ashamed of this Parliament. They are ashamed of the government. There is no question about it. It is showing in the polls. They are ashamed of the antics the government has been playing here in Ottawa. They want change and they are going to get change. They are going to get a new prime minister. I strongly believe that. They are going to get an honourable person for a prime minister, somebody who will make changes, who will respect their tax dollars, who will actually look them in the eye and tell them what needs to be done and make the appropriate changes for their benefit. That is what we are going to see out of a new government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645788"> I will go back to my friend LaVar Payne and tell him today that there is hope. Just like there was in 2006, when we changed government then, there is hope coming here now. There is going to be a change in government. We are going to see honour brought back to the system. We are going to see respect for taxpayer dollars. We are going to see a government focused on individuals and Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645789">This has been an interesting morning. I wish we were talking about everything else but this. I am glad I had a chance to voice my opinion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8645801"> Mr. Speaker, what the member is reading is speculation by the RCMP, because it does not actually have the documents to say yes or no, or confirm whether this would or would not help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645802"> The RCMP does not have it. It is not that it does not want it. The RCMP is speculating what may or may not be in there. If the government gave the documents to the RCMP and the RCMP went through them, it could make that decision. If the RCMP went through the documents and said, “This does not move forward. There is not enough here. It does not make sense,” this would all be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645803">The RCMP is speculating. The reality is, give them the documents. What harm is there? The RCMP could decide to move forward. If it moves forward with criminal charges, great. However, keeping the documents hidden does not only harm this institution of Parliament, because the government is ignoring the rule of Parliament and the order of the Speaker, but it also undermines the fact that this fund may have actually done some good work. Who knows?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645804">Right now, the fund is under a cloud. The way it looks to me, with what the Auditor General has said, this fund has serious problems, and the people around it have some serious ethical issues.</ParaText>

Within four hours, I had over 200 email replies. Within a day and a half, I had 400-and-some emails.

              <ParaText id="8645828"> Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise and speak in the House, but I am disappointed that we are on week three of speaking about parliamentary privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645829">Those who are watching at home want to know why we are here and how we got here. It all started with Sustainable Development Technology Canada. This is a fund that was designed to support initiatives for green technology, emissions reduction and things like that. The fund started in 2001, and under Liberal and Conservative governments, it went along just fine until this corrupt bunch of Liberals got involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645830">Cabinet ministers decided to give a billion dollars to the fund. They picked their friends to be on the committee to decide who was going to get the money, and the friends gave the money to their own businesses. The Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest; 80% of the projects had conflicts of interest, and there was a whistle-blower within the Sustainable Development Technology Canada department who said that there was criminal activity involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645831">As such, as parliamentarians, we wanted to look into the matter. The documents related to this fund were requested in June, but the government, the Liberals, did what they normally do: They delayed. Then, when they sent the documents, they blacked out all the useful parts. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> stood up on a question of privilege because it is our right, as parliamentarians, to get whatever documents we need to do our good work. The Speaker absolutely correctly ruled that, yes, this was a violation of our privilege, and he ordered the Liberals to deliver the unredacted documents so that we can turn them over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645832">We have been waiting for three weeks and debating this matter of privilege every day. No documents have been delivered. That is why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645833">I am going to spend my time today talking and pushing back against the Liberals' very weak arguments about why they cannot bring the documents forward. I will start with one of the myths they are spreading. They say that they cannot produce the papers, because giving them to the RCMP would violate the charter rights of Canadians. This is not true at all. The police and the RCMP get tips all the time: They get tips from Crime Stoppers, as well as phone calls and documents alleging criminal activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645834">The law says that the RCMP must do due diligence by looking at the evidence presented. If they find evidence of criminality, then they have to go to the court and order those documents through the court in order for them to be used at a trial. That is the law, so it is ridiculous to suggest that the government cannot produce the papers for that reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645835">The other thing I would say is that it is very hypocritical of the Liberals to say that they are concerned about the charter rights of Canadians. They have violated nearly every charter right. They are what their record says they are, so let us look at their record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645836">First, let us start with freedom of expression. There is Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the censorship bill, by which the government-appointed CRTC can take down an individual's content if it finds the content objectionable. Let us also talk about Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, which is the online harms bill. It would put someone in jail for life if the government thought that person might commit a hate crime in the future. That is utterly chill on freedom of expression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645837">Let us talk about freedom of religion. There are people crying “death to Jews” from coast to coast to coast. The government has done nothing to stem the flow of vandalism and harassment that is happening at synagogues and at Jewish businesses in our country. The Hindus are being persecuted by the Khalistanis; again, the government has done nothing. There are 112 Christian churches that have burned. The government has said nothing. Therefore, there is no protection for freedom of religion from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8645838">If we want to go down the list of other freedoms, let us talk about mobility rights. Every Canadian has the right to freely enter and leave Canada. That is in the Charter of Rights. However, during the pandemic, Liberals trapped four million people in the country for over two years, even after it was medically proven that people who were vaccinated could get and transmit COVID in the same way as the unvaccinated. Therefore, 90% of vaccinated people were allowed to go wherever they wanted, to leave and enter Canada. However, 10% of people, who were not a higher risk, were trapped in the country. This separated them from their families and caused a lot of trauma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645839">Then we get to the Emergencies Act, which was ruled by the courts to be illegal. I am not sure why there were no consequences for that. If I were convicted of something, I could appeal, but I would have to appeal from prison; therefore, I am not sure why there has been no action on that. However, Liberals froze people's bank accounts. That is unlawful search and seizure, so they violated another charter right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645840">When it comes to freedom from discrimination, people are not supposed to discriminate against anybody based on race, religion, age, etc., but we have seen that the Liberals do. The Canada summer jobs program discriminated against people of faith who would not sign the attestation. Moreover, the Liberals discriminated based on age when they decided to give an increase in OAS to people over 75, but not those between 65 and 74. </ParaText>

Spending a little time with the Little Sisters of the Holy Family shows us how committed and devoted these women are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645851">Saint Marie‑Léonie's legacy reminds us of the power of humility and kindness in building peace. May she be an inspiration to us all.</ParaText>

Emergency rooms have been forced to close, and the great health care professionals we do have are burnt out from working overtime to try to fill labour gaps. This has been caused in part by Canada's red tape and barriers to entry for health care workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645869">Currently, fewer than half of foreign-trained doctors and nurses are working in their profession, meaning there are 50,000 health care professionals who could be working in our hospitals but are unable to do so. That is why common-sense Conservatives will bring in a blue seal national testing standard. This will ensure foreign-trained professionals can work in their field and take their skills wherever they are needed across the country. It will include a 60-day standard so people applying for certification can take a test and receive an answer in a timely fashion.</ParaText>

Despite CSIS, the RCMP and the entire security and intelligence apparatus insisting that it is essential for all leaders to get cleared, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, who has been a member for over 20 years, refuses.

At a time when the members of the House should be united against these appalling crimes, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation>'s decision to prioritize his campaign over national security sends a message to Canadians that he will not protect them and tells the rest of the world that under a Conservative government, there will not be any consequences for foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8645895">People are rightly concerned. The NSICOP report earlier this year also alleged that India interfered in a Conservative Party leadership race.

              <ParaText id="8645990"> Our government is proud of the fact that we have provided over 54,000 Afghan refugees with safe refuge here in Canada. Over 300,000 Ukrainians have come here following Putin's illegal war in Ukraine. When my family fled Soviet Hungary in the 1950s, Canada had its doors open to people who were arriving here to flee from violence and persecution. I really fear that under a Conservative government, with this far-right, xenophobic immigration concept, families like my mom's will be sent away.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646079"> Mr. Speaker, with yesterday being Brain Cancer Awareness Day, I am pleased to present a petition on that subject. The petitioners note that an estimated 27 Canadians are diagnosed with a brain tumour each day. Fewer than three in 10 Canadians diagnosed with a tumour survive five years after their diagnosis. Brain cancer research is critically underfunded in Canada. Canada is years behind the U.S. in approving new drugs and treatments. Even when brain cancer therapies are approved, they are not always made equally accessible across the country. There continues to be a shortage of brain cancer drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646080">Accordingly, the petitioners call on the Government of Canada to increase funding for brain cancer research; work with the provinces and territories to ensure that drugs, medical devices and new therapies are accessible to brain cancer patients nationwide; and remove unnecessary red tape so brain cancer drugs can be approved more quickly.</ParaText>

Constituents and stakeholders across sectors have been very concerned about the harms of open net-pen salmon farms and the pace of the government's move to implement the transition by 2025, as promised.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8646090">Mr. Speaker, I would like to do a quick recap for anyone who missed the first part of my speech before QP. I started by saying why we have been here for three weeks debating a parliamentary privilege motion. I explained that it is because the Liberals will not produce the documents the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> ordered and that it is related to the green slush fund and the $400-million scandal, so no government business or private members' business can come forward until they produce the documents. That is what we are waiting for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646091">I started to debunk the myths of the weak reasons the Liberals have given for why they cannot produce the documents, beginning with their claim that giving the documents to the RCMP would be a violation of people's charter rights. This is absolutely not true. The police and the RCMP get tips all the time, for example through Crime Stoppers, phone calls and documents about criminal activity, and they have to exercise due diligence by looking into the evidence that is presented. If they do find evidence of criminality, then they need to go to the courts and request the documents formally so they can be used in a court case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646092">That is the law, so the argument is just a total red herring from the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646093"> I talked about the Liberals' hypocrisy in even talking about charter rights, since they have violated every one of them, and I went down the whole list. I did not get to indigenous rights because if we started talking about the way they have violated those, we would be here all day. Therefore I will move along to my second point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646094">The Liberals have claimed that there needs to be more separation between Parliament and the RCMP. Certainly I agree that there should be separation. The job of the RCMP is to enforce the rule of law for everybody equally. I think that we are what our record says we are, so let us look at the record of the relationship and the separation between the RCMP and the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646095">Let us start with the billionaire's island fiasco. Members may remember that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wasted 215,000 dollars' worth of taxpayer money. It was alleged that if he did not give himself written permission, it was actually fraud. The internal RCMP documents showed that the force considered opening a fraud investigation after details of the trip came to light, but it cited numerous reasons why it did not, including the fact that neither Parliament nor the Ethics Commissioner chose to refer the case to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646096">We can see from that, first of all, that the RCMP does accept documents from Parliament. We can also see that there was no evidence of whether or not the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> granted himself permission to go on the billionaire's island trip. If he did not, he definitely had committed fraud. The RCMP did not even bother to investigate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646097">Next is the SNC-Lavalin scandal. We know that Jody Wilson-Raybould was clear with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Elder Marques that they absolutely could not talk to the prosecutor about getting SNC-Lavalin the deal to get it off the hook. The Prime Minister kicked Jody Wilson-Raybould to the curb and put his buddy David Lametti in place, and voila, SNC-Lavalin had the agreement it needed in order to get off the hook.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646098">Did the RCMP investigate this? No, it did not, until four years after the fact, after Brenda Lucki retired, when the RCMP decided it was going to start investigating. Interestingly, as soon as it announced that, David Lametti was kicked out of cabinet and ended up stepping down as an MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646099">Let us talk about the Brenda Lucki situation. In the Nova Scotia massacre, it was clear that the RCMP was working on behalf of Parliament, with the Liberal government. An article from the National Post says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646102">There is not a lot of separation there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646103">Now let us talk about the WE Charity scandal. Subsection 119(1) of the Criminal Code outlines that it is illegal for a holder of public office to take an action that benefits themself or their family. It is clear to everyone that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took an action by approving nearly a billion dollars for the WE Charity scandal.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646104"> We all know that his mother, his brother and his wife were paid by the WE Charity to do speaking engagements. According to a BBC News article, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “I made a mistake for not recusing myself from the discussions immediately, given my family's history”. He did not make a mistake; he broke the law. Again, the RCMP did nothing. If we look at the history, we see that there is not enough separation; there needs to be more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646105">If we go on to the next thing, they are claiming there is really nothing to see. However, a whistle-blower said there was criminal activity. We should at least get the documents the Speaker correctly ordered, and we should get to work on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646106">However, it is a pattern of corruption. We have seen that with the government from the beginning. Since I was elected in 2015, there has been a history of corruption, not just at the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s level but throughout the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646107">If we recall, there was Raj Grewal, a former MP, who was charged with fraud; Joe Peschisolido, a former Liberal MP, whose company was involved in and charged with a money laundering scam; Hunter Tootoo and Darshan Singh Kang, who were charged with sexual misconduct; the current <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, in the clam scam, who gave a $25-million clam quota to his relative and a company that did not even own a boat, which was terrible; and the <Affiliation DbId="311722" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, who gave money to her husband's company. It is a total conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646108">The government is showing that it has this pattern of behaviour, and whenever the Liberals are caught, they do the obvious: They delay and refuse to release documents, or they release them all redacted. That needs to stop. Canadians have a right to know what happened to the $400 million and to get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646109">The good news is that, while we continue to debate the parliamentary privilege part of this situation, no government bills can come forward. Therefore, the awful legislation the Liberals are trying to bring forward is not going to happen. For example, Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, which would put someone in jail for life if the government thought they might commit a hate crime in the future, is not going to come forward, nor is Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>, which would take the children of Canadian citizens who live abroad, children who have never lived in Canada, and grant them Canadian citizenship. When they turned 18, they would be able to vote and decide, on their honour, where they wanted their vote to count. That is a new level of foreign interference, so I am happy that one is not coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646110">Of course, we will also not see the bill that changes the date of the election so that MPs who lose their seat still get their pension. That will not be coming forward either. Nevertheless, it is an absolute disgrace to Canadians that money, $400 million, has basically been given out with 186 conflicts of interest. They act as though there is nothing to see here. It is totally unacceptable, and if the government wants to get back to work, the Liberals should do the right thing. They should produce the unredacted documents as the Speaker has requested.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8646116">Mr. Speaker, when it comes to this green slush fund, I think one of the most disturbing things about it is that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> was part of the cabinet that approved the money for the green slush fund. He was part of the cabinet that chose the committee members who were going to decide who got the money, and the committee members gave the money to a company called Cycle Capital, which he is a stakeholder in. Once again, the Criminal Code in section 119(1) says that no holder of public office can take an action that benefits themselves or their family. I would argue that this is another example that should be looked into by the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646117">That said, how do we get Canadians' money back? Many of the companies that were awarded money were not even doing something to reduce emissions or introduce green technology. This was a fund that had existed since 2001 and never had any problems until this Liberal government got involved. This makes me wonder about other funds that it is managing and whether the same level of corruption is happening, because the Auditor General said that 80% of the projects had a conflict of interest. This is simply unacceptable, and I think that we need to get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646118">My hope is that we see these documents produced in due time. It should not take long, because the documents already exist. The Auditor General audited them, so they should be able to be produced, and we should give them to the RCMP, because knowing where to look for criminal activity is going to be key. The Liberals have argued the RCMP has the right to request documents, but it does not know which ones it wants, so that is why we have asked for all of the documents that are related to the slush fund so that we can give the RCMP all the information it needs and it can look through it. If it does see evidence of criminal activity, it will then go to court and formally order the documents so they can be used in a criminal prosecution. That is the way things are supposed to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646119">The other arguments we have heard from the Liberals have been very weak, and it is the same thing every time that there is a problem with documents. They say they want to send issue to committee and that this is what the motion is all about, but no, the motion is to produce the documents unredacted, because if it goes to committee, what will happen is what always happens, like with the WE Charity scandal, and all the other scandals I talked about. The Liberals will filibuster those meetings to keep the documents from coming forward, or they will work with their NDP partners to adjourn the debate, and that is the way things go. That is why we do not get to the bottom of these scandals; that is why these scandals keep occurring. The number of scandals that we have seen is really unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646120">I think the sad part of freezing the Sustainable Development Technology fund because of this scandal and the corruption is that it has impacted people. It has impacted a company in my riding that was getting funding to make green battery technology, which is actually quite interesting technology. It is portable. People can put it in their backpack and use it to charge devices if they are in the military or out in a place where there is no power, and all kinds of interesting things like that. The company is called AlumaPower, but now it is in the valley of death from a commercialization point of view, because of the freezing of this fund, all relating back again to the corruption of this government, which needs to come to an end with a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

Both the Auditor General and the RCMP have cited this as a really big risk that could happen again if the motion, as amended by the Conservatives, is actually allowed to go forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646124">Mr. Speaker, what I would say is this: I have actually sought a legal opinion about whether it is appropriate for us to give documentation to the RCMP. That opinion is that the RCMP gets tips all the time. People present evidence of what they think is criminal activity, and the RCMP can investigate that. It does not put anyone in jeopardy and is not going to affect anything, because if the RCMP does decide to prosecute criminally, it has to then go back to the courts and request the documents formally so they come through in the proper way to do a criminal court case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646125">However, the thing of it is that if the RCMP does not know where to look, there are a lot of documents involved in the slush fund. We need to help it do its job.</ParaText>

I do not know how this slogan translates into French, but I have some questions, because in 2019, the Bloc Québécois raised the fact that a lot of money had been diverted from this fund into oil.

Earlier my friend and colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278446" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation> used the term “third world”. We should all commit to using better language when possible.

I have been working hard to try to divorce my party from oil and gas a little.

              <ParaText id="8646158">Mr. Speaker, our debate today is happening because the executive branch of government has defied the will of Parliament. Members in this place, some months ago, passed a motion to compel the government to release documents related to $400 million of funds that were misappropriated. It is entirely within Parliament's purview to ask for documents, particularly if they are documents produced by the government and are related public expenditures. Parliament asked for these documents so that we as members could do our primary job, the reason Canadians pay our salaries, which is to hold the government to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646159">Let me remind all colleagues here that our first and primary role as a member of Parliament is to hold the executive branch of government to account. In this instance, on what we are debating today, it boggles the mind that there are members willing to work with the government to help it defy the will of Parliament and prevent parliamentarians from doing their job. It boggles the mind that there are members of the governing party who do not understand that it is not just the privileges of opposition members that have been and continue to be breached, but also the privileges of members of the governing party's caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646160">How a member arrives at the state of being willing to cede the power their constituents gave them to the centre of their party for less than nothing is easy to understand, but it is hard for someone to see in the moment. Allow me to elaborate, for all colleagues here and for colleagues who may follow us in these seats in the future, on what this means and why it is important to the debate at hand today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646161">Lev Grossman's masterwork, <I>The Magicians Trilogy</I>, an exploration of self and identity, ends with this statement: “Fillory is who I used to be, but I'm somebody different now.” This passage, profound after reading the entirety of the text, refers to the protagonist, who had structured his identity around reaching a mythical location. He reaches his goal, but the journey and what happens after change that sense of self, just as they change his sense of what power should be used for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646162">Many of us here have travelled a similar road. It is easy for our quest to earn a seat in this place and keep it to be our identity. Then, the very few of us who are fortunate to sit here are presented with yet another identity-shaping set of dangling carrots. We want a cabinet position. What about a parliamentary secretary position? What about being vice-chair of a committee?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646163"> There is inherent oil-and-water-like tension between these two potential identities because in the former, in our first-past-the-post system, power is derived by the people who voted for us to sit in this place. In the latter, power is given by the centre of our parties. The former is the only true power in politics. It is the base of power from which the centre of our parties derives theirs, and it can only be rescinded by our constituents in an election. The latter power, that from the centre of our parties, is illusory. It is derived from a critical mass of members who vote together and form the ability to give out positions and salary increases. It is bestowed at the pleasure of one man, as there have not been many women yet, and can be rescinded at his pleasure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646164">The most impactful members of Parliament understand the dual nature of power in this place and how to keep that duality in balance. In our partisan system, it is good and necessary to support the centre of the party to which one was elected and lean into the ability to accomplish things like passing a budget as a team. However, if one constantly spends one's time chasing the carrots dangled by the centre of one's party when the needs of constituents are not being served, disaster for a member, their constituents and their political party inevitably ensues. This is a law of power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646165">How does a member of Parliament put this duality into balance and keep it there? First and foremost, we need a constant connection to our constituents. This means asking our constituents constantly what is important to them and what their opinions are. With that information, we are then able to help the centres of our parties form partisan positions that benefit our communities through policy-making and constructive criticism. The most successful centres of political parties not only relish accepting this feedback but expect it from their members. That is because our communities are constantly changing. They are not homogenous; they are not static, and we cannot develop public policy that ignores their needs and will.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646166">To do this, a member needs a strong grounding outside of their political identity so we can have the courage when the need arises and so we can see a future for ourselves that does not involve being a member of Parliament. This grounding can also be our families, our hobbies, our spiritual practices or, in the best cases, a combination of all three. Without that type of external grounding, it is virtually impossible to discern what our constituent needs are when pressed upon by the media, by lobbyists and special interest groups, by our own egos and, yes, by the centre of our parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646167">Crucially, a member needs to understand the procedural rules of this place inside and out and have a capacity and willingness to use those rules. Members who do not take the time to understand what their privileges are here as members or how the Standing Orders work are like a carpenter without tools. When all these actions work together, the duality of power is balanced, good public policy is made and successful political careers are established. However, it is also deadly easy to knock this duality out of balance. This happens when a member stops listening to their constituents, starts chasing promotions and cedes the power their constituents gave them to a centre of power that has forgotten that their power, without the support of the people, is an illusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646168">Here we are today, and members of the governing party have ceded so much of their constituents' power to the centre of their party that ministers in the government feel no compunction at all about letting a $400-million spending scandal happen, because they know their partisan colleagues will not force them, or the will of Parliament, to come clean. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation> of the governing party allows his ministers to do this because he in turn knows he will not face any criticisms from his members either. Members are allowing this to happen for fear of losing their green-lit candidate status or are clinging to the hope that they are going to get a car and driver and a cabinet post.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646169">That lack of balance is why we are here today in this place with a Parliament paralyzed by a government made unwilling to accept the rule of Parliament due to the misaligned priorities of the governing party's members of Parliament. It is a shame to see colleagues, many of whom I respect in this place, willingly cede their power given what is possible for any of us and the people we represent when we lean into it instead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646170">Being a Canadian member of Parliament means that literally anyone in the world will take our call. Any policy change we elect to spend our attention on is possible to enact without limit. We in this place cannot change only our communities, but also the country and the world, so what we do with that power actually matters. It must be used responsibly and with great conscience, wielded with impeccable judgment free of ego and grounded in upholding the rule of law, democracy, Canadian pluralism and freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646171">If I could go back in time and tell myself these truths when I was first elected, I would. It would have saved me a lot of time and a lot of heartache. The only time I have failed in my role here has been when I ignored those truths. Thankfully, those moments have been few and far between in the years that I have served, and when they have happened, I have been able to recognize them, admit fault and move on. However, when I have embraced those same truths, magic has happened. These same things are possible for anybody in this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646177">At the Inter-Parliamentary Union, I have now thrice chaired the general assembly drafting committee and emerged with consensus-adopted resolutions condemning Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, with Russians sitting at the table. Just last week, I passed a resolution calling for reform to multilateral institutions to ensure their long-term viability and to be able to solve global crises and promote peace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646178">I have proudly stood with Canada's allied nations against much public pressure to do the opposite in their fight to protect themselves from terrorism and destruction. I have also, in changing times for the media, managed to build a communication platform that allows me to reach no less than a million people every day. I no longer have to rely on the stilted lens of partisan columnists or political talk show hosts to communicate an idea to the public. I can do that on my own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646179">Accomplishing these things has meant ruffling feathers, sometimes within the public, within opposing parties and even within my own caucus. Conflict is not something that we should strive for here. We should strive for peace, but speaking truth to power is not conflict. Rather, it is the essence of our existence as parliamentarians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646180">I raise my accomplishments in this place not to boast, but to inspire. Even if colleagues here might not agree with the change I have enacted, the reality is that I have now sat in every position in the House on both sides of the aisle. I have sat as a cabinet minister on the front bench and at the very back corner of this place, with my back touching the curtains. It was when I was in that last seating position that I had dinner with a woman who I very much respect, the Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould, who reminded me that I was sitting in a seat that she had once occupied. She reminded me of what she was able to accomplish from that position and where her power came from, and she expected no less from me. This hard lesson was a gift, a dose of humility, that I pray everyone in this place gets to experience at some point in their career and come through with grace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646181">I am deeply blessed to have had the counsel of Jody and other principled leaders like her. Their actions are reminders to me that no matter where a parliamentarian sits in the House, our power remains the same. I know that my ability to effect change remains limited only by my smarts, my courage, my grace, my knowledge of the rule and my willingness to pay a cost for doing right when right is needed to be done. However, that is the rub of this place, is it not? It is the cost of doing what is right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646182">In moments where we, as leaders, can feel in our deepest gut that change is needed, an admission of wrongdoing is needed, we are asked to do something that in our hearts we know we should not be doing, or if we toy with relinquishing jealousies and grudges in favour of peace, but feel like we should not be doing that, we often think about what would be lost if we were to carry through with our actions. Will it cost us our pride? How about a shot at a cabinet spot? Will it mean sitting at the back of the House? Will it mean we do not get to run again? In those moments, I challenge my colleagues to instead think about what they would gain if they were to do the right thing with the ability to effect positive change for our communities, a change in perspective, results and respect, and so we are here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646183">I understand why the government is asking members of its caucus to support it in defying the will of Parliament. The release of these documents will no doubt expose wrongdoing on the part of the government, but how are we, as parliamentarians of any political stripe, to force the government to admit wrongdoing and enact change if we cannot exercise our fundamental rights and privileges as parliamentarians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646184">Members of the government should want the will of Parliament to be upheld in this case as well. Ministers should not be allowed to act without compunction in these matters. We have a fiduciary responsibility to our constituents to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted, that they are not used to enrich people because of their proximity to the government as opposed to their place in an impartial and unbiased procurement system set under parliamentary supply rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646185"> Bureaucrats within ministries will also act without compunction if they feel as though Parliament's will can be ignored. We have all seen this at committees, where members of departments will sit there and just look at us as though we are ghosts, as though we do not matter. I reject that notion. I represent 120,000 Canadians. I stand here in the full apex of the power they have bestowed upon me, and I will not cede it. I will not let these people not be held to account. I will not let people get rich off the backs of my constituents. I will hold the government to account. It matters not what the topic is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646186">Colleagues have asked if we would be doing this if it was with respect to an oil and gas company. Absolutely, we would be. Would I be doing this if it was my political party? I absolutely would because there are things that matter more than the centre of our parties, which are the rules that uphold this place. That is why the government must immediately accept the will of Parliament to release these documents and allow itself to be held to account. It is also why the members of the caucus of the governing party should be pushing their visionless, listless, embattled and spent <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation> to do the right thing by refusing to participate in the government's blockade of Parliament's will. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646187">I am deeply grateful to be surrounded by people who not only expect me to do the right thing but also stand beside me, come hell or high water, while I do so. To Sean Schnell, Kerry and Paul Frank, Dustin and the crew, Denise, Petronella, Cole, Murdoch, Eric and Sonya, my sister, and my husband and children, I say that not a day goes by when I am not grateful for their expectation of excellence and morality, as well as their support. Their support, along with the support of countless others in Calgary Nose Hill and across the country, makes me believe that, no matter how broken our country is now, better is possible in the future. Our country is worth fighting for. I will not write it off. Our problems can be fixed. I am proud to fight for change alongside my colleagues in the Conservative Party. Our team has gone through a lot in the last several years, but standing here today, after going through that visceral time of turbulence in which we decided where we were going to set our priorities, we are now in a caucus that is filled with peace and is clearly united and focused on enacting practical, common-sense change to fix our country. That fills me with pride and hope. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646188">I guess the moral of the story is this: If members set foot in this place hoping to be comfortable or hoping to be liked, they will fail in their responsibilities to their constituents; they will fail to use the power that constituents have bestowed upon members to do what is right on their behalf. If members seek to appease people rather than to fight for what is right, if they seek to enrich themselves or save their ego instead of rising up for others and if they seek to destroy and undermine the democratic institutions that undermine the miracle that is Canada's pluralistic democracy, they will fail. They can also be sure that millions of others who believe in the beauty that is our country and understand that it only rests upon the rules of this place being followed, including me, will fight to ensure that they fail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646189">Therefore, the Liberals should govern themselves accordingly, do what is right, respect the will of Parliament and release these documents today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646224">The Liberal government has violated the rights of Parliament and parliamentarians by refusing to turn over all the unredacted documents relating to the scandal at the Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646225">The powers of parliamentary privilege are rooted in the Constitution Act, 1867, and the Parliament of Canada Act. This issue is such a significant issue that it has essentially led to the shutdown of all other parliamentary debate as we undertake the privilege motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646226">Some members, including recently a member across the way, have pointed to the previous government's refusal in 2011 to release documents. This issue was taken to a higher power, in fact the highest power of the land: the people. They decided to give that government a majority mandate after an election was fought. The people, the highest power, vindicated the government of the day's position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646227">The Liberal minority government has no mandate from the people to defy the will of Parliament. If it believes it does, which it clearly does, it should call an election so it can get that mandate from the people. However, the government is not willing to go to the highest power in the land because it already knows what the answer will be. It will be a resounding rejection of the government's decision to defy the will of Parliament and refuse to provide these documents. If the government wants to keep hiding these documents in violation of parliamentary supremacy, it must call an election to get a mandate from the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646228">I want to go into how the motion put forward came to be and why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646229"> The Auditor General of Canada, an independent office, investigated Sustainable Development Technology Canada and found that Liberal appointees gave $400 million of taxpayers' money to their own companies, involving 186 instances of conflicts of interest. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s former industry minister, Navdeep Bains, hand-picked these board members and their chair to manage a billion dollars in taxpayer funds. Then in February 2023, employees at the fund, from within the organization itself, filed a complaint, and that complaint led to an investigation. It was a complaint that Conservatives fought to get an investigation for and that the Liberal government fought tooth and nail to avoid an investigation for.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646230">When the Auditor General's report was made public, it showed that there were 186 conflicts of interest involving the board and the chair. They did a sample and found that 82% of the cases they had investigated had a conflict of interest. This is not just a one-off case where somebody maybe mistook the rules and had a minor interest in something and did not think it mattered. Instead, 82% of cases in a sample taken showed conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646231">In one case, Annette Verschuren, who was the Liberal-appointed chair of the green slush fund, gave $217,000 to her own company. It has yet to return the money. According to one of the whistle-blowers from the organization, “our democratic systems and institutions are being corrupted by political interference”. The people who were in the organization itself were saying that there was political interference going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646232">This fund operated well. There were a lot of goals to provide funding to promote sustainable development and new technologies. I know that there are companies in my riding that have accessed this funding. However, under the Liberal government, it was allowed to turn into a slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646233">In fact, under the previous Conservative government, when this fund was looked into, it was given a clean bill of health. It was only under the Liberal government, under the decay and negligence, and with the turning of a blind eye to corruption, that this once pristine organization, was allowed to descend into the mires of this corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646234">Though SDTC should have been at arm's length from the government, it was not. It was found, in numerous cases, that the government had intricate involvements in the day-to-day affairs of SDTC, something that made it ripe for corruption and political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646235">I want to talk about some of the cases here, just to elaborate for Canadians how serious this is. For one board member, who was a board member from 2015 to 2021, their companies, companies they had an interest in, received $114 million dollars while they were sitting on the board. They did not recuse themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646236">In this case, for the company in question, which was Cycle Capital, the value of this company tripled during this member's time on the board of directors. Do members know who Cycle Capital's paid lobbyist during this time period was? It was the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. Talk about strong ties. This board member was appointed to the Canada Infrastructure Bank's board of directors in 2021. No bad deed goes unrewarded under the Liberal government. They allocated an additional $170 million to Annette Verschuren's company when Verschuren was the chair of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646237">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, before entering Parliament, was the lobbyist for this company that had tripled in value, and it had received an immense amount of funds from this fund. He lobbied 25 times just in the year before he was elected to the House. The Prime Minister's Office and the industry department gave his client over $100 million from this fund. When he became a cabinet minister, it did not end. He approved $750 million in funding through SDTC and $250 million of that went to Cycle Capital, a company that the minister continues to hold shares in to this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646238">In another case, a slush fund board member who was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> admitted in committee that $17 million went to companies in which he had an interest. In another case, a former political staffer who was a political staffer for Liberal environment minister David Anderson, who was a political organizer for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in British Columbia, approved $5 million for companies in which he had an interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646239">There is the board chair, who I have mentioned before. Former minister Navdeep Bains replaced the previous chair of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada council with Annette Verschuren, after the previous chair criticized the government's tech policies. So much for listening to the experts, and so much for muzzling experts. Do members know who that previous board chair was? It was Jim Balsillie, one of the pioneering tech entrepreneurs of our country. He started BlackBerry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646240"> In fact Jim Balsillie warned the government about the conflict of interest in appointing Ms. Verschuren, but the government ignored it anyway. In fact the Liberal minister at the time knew that Ms. Verschuren's companies were receiving funds, yet he appointed her anyway. He ignored repeated warnings from the Privy Council office, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office and his own office. In fact in one case, Ms. Verschuren herself even told him that she had a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646241">However, that was not good enough for the Liberal government. It was going to go ahead and appoint its hand-picked chair. Verschuren moved a motion and voted to send $220,000 to her own company. The Ethics Commissioner found her guilty of violating ethics laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646242">I am going to quote from one of the whistle-blowers, because so many whistle-blowers have come forward.

              <ParaText id="8646255">That is why we need the RCMP to investigate. It was not in the scope of the Auditor General's mandate to look into whether there were criminal actions. On the surface, I think there is evidence that points to possible criminal actions, but that is really up to the RCMP, and the RCMP cannot do its job unless it gets the full documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646256">Why must the House obtain the documents? Whistle-blowers claim that criminal intent would be found if the documents were given to the RCMP, so the government should not be withholding the documents in any way. A majority of members of the House passed a motion demanding that the documents be turned over, and the Liberals refused or they sent heavily redacted documents instead. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has argued that Parliament's rights were breached, and the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> agreed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646257">This is not the only Liberal scam. We know that during the pandemic the Liberals gave themselves unlimited taxing and spending powers.

              <ParaText id="8646258">We know that the Prime Minister tried to hand $900 million to an organization that was paying his own family members. I found it very interesting, going back over the WE Charity debates, to learn that there were many other wonderful people who had wonderful experiences and were speaking at WE Charity events, but they were not getting paid anything. Curiously, it appeared to be only members of the Prime Minister's family who were getting paid. What a coincidence that was. There are questions that still need to be asked and answers that have yet to be given.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8646259">We know that in 2021, the government took the Speaker of the House to court over the Winnipeg lab documents. The House asked for those documents. We fought an election on it. The government was handed a minority mandate with a lower percentage of the popular vote than the Conservative Party. The Liberals do not have a clear mandate. They were given a mandate to work with other parties in this House and the government has refused to work with members. It has stonewalled and refused to give these documents, in defiance of the will of Parliament, a mandate it did not get from the Canadian people in the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646260"> We are only scratching the surface. The Auditor General was only able to review half of the transactions in this case. When we consider that 82% of a sample size had conflicts of interest, we know a full review would show even more conflicts of interest. The CFO of the industry department called this worse than the sponsorship scandal. What is the government trying to hide? This is just the tip of the iceberg, and that is how it starts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646261"> I remember my late friend, who, sadly, passed away this summer, John Williams, former MP and former chair of the public accounts committee, who relentlessly worked on a little-known issue called the sponsorship scandal, or ad scam. It happened in the 1990s. Some people started talking about it. It really blew up in the 2000s. It was only because of the relentless work of opposition parties in this Parliament and that committee that Canadians got the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646262"> Then there was the Gomery inquiry, which showed the Liberal Party misappropriated funds, was sending funds to ad agencies, funds that were being returned to the Liberal Party in the form of donations. My late friend John Williams always told me the thing that separates a great society from a failing society is accountability. That was his watchword in his life: accountability. Under the current Liberal government, accountability has been allowed to go by the wayside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646263"> We are doing our best here in the opposition. We are standing up here every day exposing the government's corruption and lack of transparency. The Liberals were talking about being “open by default” back in 2015, and about sunny ways. We have come a long way in these past nine years. Canadians would be right to be pretty cynical about the current government. Liberals talk a lot about slogans in the House, but we remember those slogans and they have been tossed to the wayside along with accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646264">Accountability is so essential because in great societies, when we have institutions that work as they should, when we have government that respects the rule of law and the will of its Parliament, there is transparency. When there is transparency, there is accountability, and when there is accountability, people do their jobs and do not steal money. They do not covet gold; they covet honour. We should all covet honour in this House. We should all be proud to be the guiltiest person to covet honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646265"> However, under the Liberal government, after the hundreds of millions of dollars, or billions if we are looking at the broad swath of scandals under nine years of the current Liberal government, we have seen that what has been allowed to fester in this country is the coveting of gold, the coveting of taxpayer money, which has been misappropriated, for the benefit of the few to the detriment of the people. The people are the highest power in the land: the people who send us here, who give us a job to do and who we have to be accountable to at the end of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646266">Conservatives will always push for accountability. We are the people who brought in the Federal Accountability Act, after all. After we form government again, there will have to be some revisions to that accountability act because, after nine years, the Liberals have certainly given us a lot of examples of the ways they could get around those rules and abuse the processes. There are going to have to be a lot of updates to that document because the Liberals have given us a lot of lessons in what not to do and how not to run a government. The Liberal government is comfortable with wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. There does not appear to be any real effort by the current government to recoup that money. The Liberals have broken the trust of hard-working Canadians. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s trust has been broken. The Liberals have broken Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646267">The Liberals do not have a mandate to defy the will of Parliament. They do not have a mandate to withhold these documents from the RCMP. If they want to get a mandate, as I said earlier, it is time to call an election so the Canadian people can decide if they are right or wrong. I am not afraid to ask that question, but I know the members on the other side are afraid to ask that question. Let us get to an election right now.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Eric Melillo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues. It is always very humbling and an honour to rise in this place to speak on behalf of the people of northwestern Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646304">Today, of course, we are speaking about a very important matter. I wish I could say that this motion is unprecedented, but it is not the first time the government has disobeyed, disregarded or otherwise simply not cared about an order the House has made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646305">When I was first elected over five years ago, I made a promise to the people of northwestern Ontario, the people who put their trust in me to represent them here and fight for their best interests. That promise was to ensure that government is acting in their best interests and spending their tax dollars responsibly. That is something we have not seen the government do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646306">Currently, the regular business of this House, as many know at this point, has been on hold because the government refuses to hand over documents the House has ordered of it. This is preventing us from doing anything. We are at an absolute standstill, and it is preventing us from addressing other issues that the NDP-Liberal government has caused, such as the doubling of housing costs; the creation of the housing crisis, with many young people giving up completely on their dream of home ownership; the affordability crisis; the infrastructure gap in first nations; and the crime the government has unleashed by breaking the bail system and implementing catch-and-release policies for violent criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646307">All of these issues are on the back burner now because the government is instead choosing to gridlock Parliament. It is the only one that has the power to end it. If the government were to comply with the House order and hand over all documents related to the green slush fund, we could get back to the regularly scheduled programming of the House. Instead, it is going to great lengths to protect itself and withhold them. I would imagine it is very damaging information given the extent it is willingness to go to do this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646308">I want to touch a bit on parliamentary privilege. Of course, it is a crucial function for ensuring that the legislative branch of government can meet one of its main objectives, that is, holding the government accountable. With this privilege comes extraordinary powers to ensure that the government cannot interfere with parliamentarians meeting that objective. In particular, this privilege includes the power to order the production of documents that the House deems necessary to carry out its duties. This is important. There is not a similar privilege afforded to the government to refuse an order for the production of said documents. I will get back to that more later, but I first want to talk about why we are here discussing the motion before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646309">Last year, as folks at home know and members of the House know, we learned of allegations that Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, the organization the government entrusted to administer its billion-dollar green slush fund, was grossly mismanaging this fund. When a former employee blew the whistle, the government commissioned Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton to inquire about the allegations. Its report later confirmed a number of those allegations to be true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646310">If we fast-forward from that point to December 11, 2023, one of those employees testified at the industry committee. This former employee outlined that tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were misspent by SDTC. Alongside that, there were conflicts of interest, and senior-level managers were playing favourites. On top of all of that, when concerns were raised, complaints were never taken seriously and were always swept under the rug. This is the testimony that was heard at committee. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646314">That is disgraceful. These are shocking allegations about the improper use of taxpayer dollars. That it would not be taken seriously and that the minister would cover it up is even worse. At that point, the committee also learned that Liberal-appointed members had violated conflict of interest rules. Alongside the committee's investigation, the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner were doing their own investigations. Unfortunately, under the government, it has become even more unsurprising what it has allowed to happen under its watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646315">As we look to the industry committee's meeting from January 31 of this year, during that meeting, Leah Lawrence, the former president and CEO of SDTC, told the committee that she had warned the government about the board chair's conflict of interest. That is very clear. The government was warned about this conflict of interest. She had also told the committee about the chair's conflicts of interest. However, the chair disregarded that and sent money to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646316">Ms. Lawrence's testimony also said that she shared those concerns with former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains' office, but the Liberals allowed the chair to stay in charge. Despite Liberal claims that they only learned about the abuse of the fund this year, Ms. Lawrence's testimony made very clear to all parliamentarians, and indeed, all Canadians, that they have known about it since 2019, which was five years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646317">I will also note that, at that time, the NDP-Liberal government and the Bloc Québécois were refusing to get documents from SDTC that would expose the level of corruption at this organization. Disclosure documents had also gone missing, or were filled out after the fact when the probe asked for them. A report into SDTC said the conflict of interest policy was “inconsistently applied”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646318">If we are going through the timeline, as we have been doing, and we fast-forward a bit more to June 4 of this year, the Auditor General released a damning report about Sustainable Development Technology Canada. She, the Auditor General, found the government had turned SDTC into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. She also found that SDTC had awarded funding to projects that were ineligible and where conflicts of interest existed. In total, 123 million dollars' worth of contracts were found to have been given inappropriately, with $59 million being given to projects that never should have been awarded any money at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646319">On top of this, the Auditor General discovered that conflicts of interest were connected to approval decisions. As a consequence of this, nearly $76 million in funding was awarded to projects where there was a connection to the Liberals' friends who had been appointed to roles within SDTC, while $12 million in funding was given to projects that were both ineligible and had a conflict of interest. In fact, the Auditor General discovered that long-established conflict of interest policies were not followed in 90 instances. In one case, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked chair siphoned off over $200,000 to her own company.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646338">One of the more well-known scandals, the WE Charity scandal, draws a lot of similarities to the SDTC green slush fund scandal, in particular with money being given where a conflict of interest exists. In the WE Charity case, the Ethics Commissioner found that then finance minister Bill Morneau broke the law by violating the Conflict of Interest Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646339">Finally, we have the SNC-Lavalin scandal, where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and other senior officials tried to pressure then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin. When she refused, she was kicked out of cabinet and out of caucus. The Prime Minister was found guilty once again by the Ethics Commissioner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646340">This has become a pattern with the Liberal government, and it has caused a lot of Canadians to become incredibly frustrated or perhaps even jaded with politicians in general, because all they see is scandal after scandal coming from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646341">I want to end my speech with a message to Canadians. This is not how their government should be ran. Their government should not be caught up in scandal after scandal, improperly spending taxpayer dollars and trying to cover it up or trying to give money to well-connected Liberal insiders. That is why the Conservatives are going to keep fighting for Canadians by getting to the bottom of this scandal. Canadians deserve to know what is in the documents the government is hiding, and anyone who broke the law should be prosecuted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646342">It is clear the government is not worth the cost or the corruption and that only common-sense Conservatives will take action to clean up this mess. Above all, it is time for a carbon tax election so that Canadians can elect a common-sense Conservative government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime and stop the corruption.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646355"> It is a bit rich for Conservatives to be pointing the finger at the Liberals when their own past is so tarnished by corruption and scandals. During the Harper majority regime, we had much bigger scandals that were covered up by Conservatives. I just have to mention them, because I think it is important to come back to them. The ETS scandal was $400 million; we never got to the bottom of it. The G8 scandal was $1 billion; we were never able to get answers because the Harper regime shut down any inquiries. The Phoenix pay scandal was $2.2 billion. The anti-terrorism funding, in the complete absence of a paper trail, was over $3 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8646367">The other reason we are here is that the Speaker ordered that papers be printed and given to the House so that an investigation can take place. What was seen?

              <ParaText id="8646397"> Canada's justice system is broken under the NDP-Liberals. Only Conservatives will bring home jail, not bail, and stop the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646398">Two million Canadians are lining up at food banks each month because of the NDP-Liberal government's inflationary policies and carbon tax. I would again ask the people who are listening in how many tent encampments they have in their communities and if they had them nine years ago. Over 1,400 tent encampments have crept up in Ontario. In my home province of British Columbia, we are seeing tent encampments at rest areas along the highways. Life has become unaffordable for most Canadians after nine years. Instead of fixing the problem and what they broke, the Liberals get caught wasting more taxpayer dollars to funnel to their green slush fund. That $400 million could have gone a long way to fixing some of these policies and challenges we face in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646399">I mentioned earlier that over 47,000 Canadians lost their lives to overdose since 2016. Overdose is the leading cause of death for youths aged 10 to 18 in my home province of British Columbia. This crisis has been exacerbated by failed Liberal-NDP policies, including experiments such as so-called safe supply and the decriminalization of deadly drugs in B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646400">Two weeks ago, we saw the parents of Brianna MacDonald. She had just turned 13 years of age, and she died from an overdose in a homeless encampment in Abbotsford, B.C. Masha Krupp testified yesterday; she is an Ottawa mother whose daughter died from an overdose and whose son is addicted to government-funded hydromorphone. How can the government members live with themselves when they spend a billion dollars on failed drug policies to perpetuate addictions and make overdose worse, rather than investing in treatment and recovery for our loved ones?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8646401"> The bottom line is that the NDP-Liberal government has now frozen the business of the House with the green slush fund scandal. It could end this right now by handing over the documents that Parliament requested, so we can allow the RCMP to do its job and arrest the Liberal cronies at SDTC. Instead, it is trying to cover its tracks and defend the corrupt behaviour of its friends. Meanwhile, our country is broken and hurting. </ParaText>

It is time for the government and the Prime Minister to face and call for a carbon tax election. Let us bring it home.</ParaText>
