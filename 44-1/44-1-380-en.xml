            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8753156"> Mr. Speaker, obviously, the government has not taken me up on my offer of Friday, that I would give up the last six minutes of my speech if it just decided to do a Friday document dump with this information being handed over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753157">At the end of my speech on Friday, I was talking about the gravy train that had to come to an end at some point for SDTC when whistle-blowers in 2022, and more so in 2023, came forward with very concerning allegations. The Auditor General rightfully announced that there would be an audit of SDTC, which was released in June 2024, and only a sample of those contracts were actually investigated by the AG. She found that $390 million of funds was inappropriately awarded. Even worse, there were 186 conflicts of interest, not one, not two, not that this would be acceptable, and this was only a quarter of all the projects. We can all assume that the damage is much worse for taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753158"> In light of this damning evidence provided by the AG, the House of Commons of duly elected members passed a motion directing the government to hand over those documents. It was stipulated that they could also be handed to the RCMP, which could investigate whether criminal offences were committed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753159"> What have the Liberals done? They did their best work in delaying and distracting, forcing the Speaker to rule that the government had violated the privilege of the House and all of its members. As representatives of Canadians, wherever we may come from and whatever party we may be a part of, it is our duty to defend and uphold our democratic institutions, especially in light of the overwhelming disrespect being shown by the Liberal government for not just taxpayers but for all Canadians who we represent here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753160">It is surprising to me that I see a continued silence from the government side, those who are more or less willingly aiding and abetting the government in this. It is objectively wrong, and we all know that. To not stand up against it is simply wrong. This is not a technical disagreement or a procedural matter. It is a direct and deliberate defiance of the authority of Parliament and the fundamental bedrock of our democracy. In turn, the government itself has sabotaged the work of Parliament, preventing anything from moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753161"> The question of course has to be: What are the Liberals hiding? Why are they so concerned about handing over these documents? What are the consequences that they fear so much? Their refusal to release these documents speaks volumes, and Canadians are sick and tired of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753162">I would like to narrow in on one specific piece of this plot line, which is on our radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, whose behaviour epitomises what is wrong with the Liberal government. Before he came to Ottawa to enact his lazy and failed environmental policies, he was a strategic adviser at Cycle Capital, an environmental venture firm owned and operated by an individual who was miraculously on the SDTC board, where millions of dollars were given to this firm. The minister owns shares in Cycle Capital, a business that has profited handsomely during this time. In fact, its valuation skyrocketed roughly 600% since he entered cabinet and, of course, another $17 million were handed over during his tenure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753163"> This is not a lapse in judgment; this is a blatant conflict of interest. It is really a slap in the face to Canadians who expect their tax dollars to be spent wisely, not used to make oneself and one's friends rich. The minister has ignored the law. He has made a mockery of his position and the public trust that he holds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753164">To summarize in my last two minutes, the Auditor General looked at five years of transactions, 226 deals that were approved, and found 186 conflicts of interest. In different terms, 82% of all the transactions had a conflict of interest. Again, it was not 1%, not 2%, not that this would be acceptable, but this is so far beyond acceptable. The fact that we have seen a government refuse to hand over documents and that members on the government side have not stood up and said that this is something they should probably take a serious look at, that maybe the RCMP should too is why it is so vital that these documents be handed over. At the time, the conflicts of interest were deemed “manageable” by the chair of the board, the Liberal-appointed chair, who has seen this rot and corruption run rampant throughout her time in leading this board. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753165"> What is worse is that when we think about the volume of $400 million, it is very difficult to understand what that made-up amount of money seems like. People should think about the taxes they pay with respect to income tax. They should think of their neighbours down the street and all those in their communities, the well over 20,000 people, at the average salary, paying all their taxes just for the government to waste it to make itself richer. At the end of the day, it is vital for the government to be honest, to show a little humility for the first time in these long, miserable last nine years of its tenure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753166"> I hope that some of my Liberal colleagues, after hearing me and many of our colleagues discuss this egregious process that has been taken, will stand up and say that it is time to cut the cover-up, to hand over the documents and face whatever consequences may be entailed. This simply cannot stand. Canadians are watching. They are waiting patiently for a carbon tax election. Let us have that election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753167"> Mr. Speaker, the member said that “it is our duty to defend and uphold our democratic institutions.” Today there is breaking news from the CBC with regard to the Conservative leadership. I would like to quote from the story. It says, “campaign workers were told by representatives of the government of India to stop supporting Brown, not to sell membership cards for him and not to invite him to certain events.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753168"> There is a strong connection between the corruption within the Conservative Party and its leadership and the current leader. This is a very serious issue, yet we have the leader of the Conservative Party today refusing to get the security clearance, the only leader in the House of Commons who has refused. I have been accusing him for weeks now of hiding something. I believe this is one of the issues that he has been hiding behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753169">When the member talks about defending and upholding our democratic institutions, does he not believe that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9"> leader of the official opposition </Affiliation> has a responsibility to Canadians to stop hiding, come clean and get the security clearance?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753170">Mr. Speaker, I said earlier that the government's best attribute is to distract and deflect. That question was a great way of showing that. This is about the $400 million of corrupt lining of the pockets of Liberals and their insiders. To try to spin this into anything else is just simply absurd.</ParaText>

Meanwhile the Liberals have been making themselves and their Liberal insiders rich.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753172">Mr. Speaker, it is shocking to me how much of a scandal this is and how much money we are talking about. I thought it was very collegial of my colleague to have offered the government to give up his time if it simply released the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753173"> When I talk to people in Fort McMurray—Cold Lake, they are astounded by the fact that the government is so afraid of what these documents contain that it refuses to release them. Is that something he hears about in Portage—Lisgar?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753174">Mr. Speaker, absolutely, it is a topic of conversation when folks turn on CPAC and wonder why we are still debating this. Logical people like the common-sense folks who I represent ask why the government would not just hand over these documents. They say that there has to be something to hide. Most definitely they ask me what I think is in the documents. I tell them I do not know because the government has a great track record, whenever they do hand over any documents, of heavily blacking out and redacting documents so we can barely read them. We have been seeing this at our environment committee about a second new green slush fund, which I suspect we may be having a similar debate about in the not-too-distant future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753175"> The other question I am often asked about is when can we have the carbon tax election. I hope to answer that very soon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753176"> Mr. Speaker, I came up yesterday with great anticipation that we would get some work done this week in the House of Commons for Canadians.

Canadians ask me where the money is, where it has gone. We have borrowed, we have spent and now we see more Liberal corruption.

              <ParaText id="8753180">Mr. Speaker, one thing that really grabbed my attention was that 82% of the files the Auditor General went through were found to have some corruption potential. I am also concerned that these are just the documents the Auditor General reviewed. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753182">Mr. Speaker, that is a great point. Like in any other sampling, polling or anything like that, a sample is picked, and that is what the Auditor General obviously did. This is the level of corruption that was found during that investigation. It is only reasonable to assume the percentage would continue and, worse, the dollar value of the nearly $400 million of misspent funds is going to continue on that same trajectory, too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753183">We do not yet know the total cost to taxpayers of the Liberal corruption, which is obviously of deep concern. That is why it is so vital that, despite the deflection and distraction attempts by Liberals across the way, we get to the bottom of this and, more importantly, give the RCMP the opportunity to view these documents to find out if, in fact, anything criminal took place with the $390 million that we know of, and probably a heck of a lot more.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753187">I was not sent here by my constituents to be a guy who says, “It is fine; it is only $400 million and since the Liberals have spent so much more than that, it is really just a drop in the bucket.” While he may not care about the taxpayers' money that is brought in by the government, and the additional amounts borrowed to pay for its tax-and-spend policies that are driving up the cost of everything, my constituents do. Every day, I will consider this not a waste of time and money but a proud role that opposition members must and will continue to play until the government hands over the documents.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8753191"> Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly six months since the order was given by the House demanding the Liberal government provide documents regarding conflicts with Sustainable Development Technology Canada's board of directors. For the last two and a half months, the chamber has been in the midst of the longest privilege debate this place has ever seen. Why is that? The reason is not complicated: The Liberal government has refused to honour its obligation, as affirmed by the House, to produce unredacted documents related to the $400-million green slush fund scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753192">It can be tempting to look at this issue from only a procedural lens, but that would be a mistake. This is not just a procedural issue; it strikes at the very core of the democratic accountability of this country. Government transparency is paramount to the functioning of our democracy. This principle is not just a matter of political theory but the foundation upon which trust between Canadians and their elected officials is built. Without it, confidence in public institutions erodes, governance fails and the needs of everyday Canadians are ignored. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753193">The ruling of the Speaker was clear: the government must produce these documents. The House has the authority to compel the production of documents, persons or papers, yet for two and a half months, the Liberal government has defied this directive by withholding critical information. That is just the time we have been speaking about this in the House. It disrespects not only the will of the members of the House but also every single Canadian we have the honour of representing. In this place, we are their voices. When we ask for transparency and accountability from the government on their behalf, the government should recognize the full weight of responsibility it has, not only to the House but also to the Canadians we represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753194">In response to the order from the Speaker, the Liberal government provided heavily redacted documents, which is not in the spirit of what was requested and is not enough. What we need, and what Canadians deserve, are the full, unredacted records so they can be handed over to the appropriate authorities for thorough investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753195">This scandal is staggering in its scope. We are talking about $400 million of taxpayers' money funnelled into a so-called green initiative that enriched Liberal-appointed board members. There were 186 documented conflicts of interest, where individuals on this board voted on decisions that directly benefited their own financial interests. That is almost equivalent to one conflict every other day last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753196">The situation surrounding Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, is a clear example of the need for greater government accountability. SDTC was a Crown corporation funded entirely by taxpayers. Its mandate was to promote the development and commercialization of clean technologies and contribute to environmental sustainability. In theory, SDTC was an organization that should have been helping to build a greener, more sustainable future for Canada. Instead, we see an organization where the scale of corruption is mind-boggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753197">To put $400 million into perspective, it is the annual federal income tax paid by around 22,000 hard-working Canadian families. These families sacrifice their time and energy to pay their dues, believing their money will be used to improve their lives and communities. Instead, it went to enrich a select few Liberal insiders. That is not just mismanagement; it is a betrayal of public trust and we should not turn a blind eye to it. However, the most troubling part of this scandal is not the misallocation of taxpayers' dollars; it is the fact that despite these findings, the Liberal government has failed to act. The House issued an order for the production of documents related to this scandal that could help uncover the full extent of the wrongdoing and hold those responsible to account, yet the government has refused to comply.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753198">The Auditor General is an essential part of our system of checks and balances. This independent officer of Parliament is tasked with reviewing government operations and ensuring that public funds are spent wisely and ethically. The Auditor General's office gives Canadians an impartial, thorough examination of government activities, often uncovering serious issues of mismanagement, waste or misconduct that would otherwise remain hidden. It is the job of the House to take those findings seriously, to examine them and to demand accountability from those who are entrusted with managing public resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753199">The Auditor General's work is not only about finding faults but also about protecting Canadians. When the Auditor General raises a red flag, it is the responsibility of the government to respond with transparency, to take corrective action and to ensure public funds are being spent appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753200">The Auditor General looked at the operations of Sustainable Development Technology Canada after a whistle-blower came forward. She conducted a thorough investigation and ultimately highlighted some troubling findings. She determined that the whistle-blower complaints were rooted in serious issues within SDTC; shockingly, her investigation uncovered nearly 400 million dollars' worth of contracts that were inappropriately awarded to members of the board of directors, all of whom had multiple conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753201">Despite the Auditor General's finding and the grave nature of the issues uncovered, we see a government that continues to ignore its responsibility. The Liberal government has failed to comply with House orders, obstructed investigations and protected insiders who have violated public trust. This cannot continue. In recent months, Canadians have witnessed a troubling pattern of obfuscation and avoidance from the government. Time and again, legitimate requests for accountability have been met with redacted documents, shifting narratives and outright refusals. This has to end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753202">We owe it to Canadians to bring transparency back to governance, to hold those in power accountable and to get the House back to working on the issues that matter most to Canadians. It should be addressing the affordability crisis, getting more houses built, stopping crime and restoring public safety, to name just a few of these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753203">The reality is that many questions about what happened remain unanswered. Why has the Liberal government left the House paralyzed for two months, allowing no significant progress on the legislation? Why are they willing to forgo their own agenda in a minority parliament, in which time is critical? The only logical conclusion is that the truth buried in these documents is worse than a stalled legislative agenda. It must be very bad for the government to risk so much to keep it hidden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753204">This is not the first time the Liberals have resorted to such tactics. When faced with the WE Charity scandal, they prorogued Parliament. When questions arose about their poor management of security at the Winnipeg microbiology lab, they called an election to avoid releasing documents. Time and time again, they have chosen evasion rather than accountability. It is not a stretch to conclude that this is what is happening now. This has brought us to the place where we are today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753205">Let us continue with the matter at hand: the mismanagement of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or as many Canadians know it, the green slush fund. Because the Liberals are the ones who brought this forward, maybe it should be called the red slush fund. Established to foster innovation in sustainable technologies, SDTC was a promising initiative. However, under the government's watch, it has devolved into a symbol of cronyism and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753206">The Auditor General's investigation into SDTC uncovered staggering governance failures: $400 million in contracts tainted by conflicts of interest, $123 million misappropriated, $59 million awarded to ineligible projects and $12 million handed out in outright conflicts of interest. Board members awarded funding to companies they owned or had financial stakes in. Public officials sat idly by as they witnessed 96 conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753207">Despite whistle-blowers' raising alarms, the government dragged its feet in addressing these issues. This is not just mismanagement; it is a betrayal of the public trust. The damage done to the public trust is immeasurable. When we demand transparency in the handling of these funds, this is not an exercise in political theatre. It is an effort to get justice for Canadians, who work hard every day, pay their taxes and expect their government to manage those funds responsibly. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753208">How has the government responded? It has refused to comply with House orders to produce unredacted documents, thereby impeding a criminal investigation; this obstruction is completely unacceptable. Transparency is not a partisan issue. It is not right versus left. It is not Conservatives versus NDP-Liberals. It is a democratic necessity that is part of how our system works and how trust in the system is fostered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753209">A government that does not believe it is accountable to the people it is supposed to be serving will inevitably behave according to its beliefs. The Liberal government does not believe it owes Canadians transparency, so it denies them access to information about how their tax dollars are being spent. This principle carries into other aspects of governance. If the Liberals do not believe they must be accountable to Canadians on this matter, they certainly will not act any differently on other issues before us. We see the evidence of this today. Canadians are paying the price for the government's failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753210">We can consider the state of affordability in this country. The cost of living has skyrocketed under the Liberal government. Housing costs have doubled, food prices have soared, and gas and home heating are more expensive than ever. Food banks are overwhelmed. Over two million Canadians visited food banks in March alone, for a shocking 90% increase since 2019. Families are skipping meals and buying less-nutritious food. Seniors on fixed incomes and children now make up a significant portion of those seeking help. This is a grim reality for far too many of our communities. This troubling trend proves true in my riding, where the Samaritan House food bank saw nearly 2,000 more people accessing their services in the last two years. Four in every 10 are children, and one in every 10 is a senior. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753211">Meanwhile, the Liberal government is preparing to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ per litre, 19%, driving up costs across the board. From the farmer who grows our food to the trucker who delivers it, every step of the supply chain is burdened by the tax; the costs are passed on to consumers. Canadians cannot afford these increases, yet the government continues to prioritize ideology over the real needs of families and individuals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753212">The housing crisis is another glaring failure of the government. Over the past nine years, housing costs have doubled. Where it once took 39% of household income to cover the costs of a home, today it takes nearly 60%. This is not sustainable. Young Canadians, many of whom should be looking forward to buying their first homes, are instead stuck living with their parents or renting indefinitely. For some, home ownership has become a distant dream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753213">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has proposed a common-sense solution: axing the federal GST on the construction of new homes priced under a million dollars. This policy would save Canadian homebuyers up to $50,000 per home and generate 30,000 additional homes annually, stimulating the economy at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753214">Why does the government refuse to implement such practical measures? Is it because it is too focused on defending its record of failure to consider solutions? Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753215">Let us turn to crime for a moment. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, our once-safe towns and cities have become rife with crime and chaos. According to a new report, between 2014 and 2022, violent crime in Canada increased by 43.8%. This means that Canada's violent crime rate is 14% higher than that of the United States. On top of this, between 2014 and 2022, the property crime rate in Canada increased by 7%; it is 27% higher than the property crime rate in the U.S., which declined by 24.1% in the same years. On top of that, the number of property crimes in Canada was lower than that in the United States until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected in 2015. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753216">Homicides are also up in Canada, increasing by 53.5% between 2014 and 2022. Online criminal behaviour is still rampant, including online crimes targeting children, yet the Liberals' only response has been to table two censorship bills forcing Canadians into a false choice between their safety and free expression. Behind these statistics are real people. There are families torn apart by loss, communities grappling with fear and victims left without justice. What has the Liberals' response been? It has been a radical catch-and-release policy that puts repeat violent offenders back on the streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753217">Canadians deserve safe communities where children can play in parks without fear and seniors can walk home from the grocery store without looking over their shoulders. The Conservative plan is clear: It is to end the catch-and-release policies and impose jail, not bail, for repeat violent offenders. Only common-sense Conservatives will do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753218">Let us consider the government's environmental record, especially in light of SDTC's failure to manage taxpayers' dollars for the promotion of green technology ethically and responsibly. Over nine years, the government claims to have spent $100 billion on climate initiatives, yet the results are abysmal. Canada remains the only G7 country whose emissions have increased since the Paris Agreement. The only meaningful drops in emissions occurred during the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 lockdowns, circumstances unrelated to any government policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753219"> Let us talk about the net-zero accelerator fund, an $8-billion initiative. Even the Auditor General found no evidence that this spending led to any measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This is not just inefficiency; it is negligence. Canadians deserve accountability for every dollar spent, particularly when the stakes are as high as our environment and future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753220">The Liberals have tried to distract Canadians with a temporary, two-month tax cut and a $250 cheque set to arrive next April, which they have now reneged on. These are not solutions. They are gimmicks. What Canadians need is real, lasting relief. The Conservative plan to permanently axe the carbon tax on everything forever and remove GST on new home construction would provide meaningful support to families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753221">I raise all these issues because they are important for all of us to see in the House. They are important to the people who sent us here. The House has work to do, and Canadians are counting on us to address the issues that have an impact on their daily lives. However, we find ourselves paralyzed by the Liberal government's refusal to be transparent and accountable. Transparency is the first step toward rebuilding trust. When the government hides behind redactions and delays, it sends a clear message to Canadians that it has something to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753222">The House cannot and should not turn a blind eye to such issues as the $400-million green, or red, slush fund scandal. Canadians deserve better. They deserve a government that is transparent, accountable and focused on their well-being, not one that hides behind redactions and procedural games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753223">The SDTC scandal, with its conflicts of interest, mismanagement and failure to follow the law, is just the latest in a long line of troubling episodes. Instead of taking responsibility, the Liberal government continues to deflect, obfuscate and delay. Ministers refuse to provide the necessary documents to investigators, and government departments continue to withhold information from the public and the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753224">This kind of behaviour sends a dangerous message to Canadians: Those in power are not accountable to the people who elected them, and they can break the law without consequence. This is not just one scandal or one issue. It is about ensuring that the government works for the people, not insiders and political cronies. It is about making sure that every dollar spent is accounted for and that public funds are used wisely and effectively. It is about ensuring that those who violate the public's trust are held responsible for their actions, no matter their political affiliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753225">I call on the government to end the cover-up and release the unredacted documents related to SDTC. Canadians have a right to know how their money is spent and who benefited from this mismanagement.</ParaText>

Specifically, my focus will be on how the Liberal environment minister, propped up by the NDP, is directly tied to the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753264">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> was tied to the green slush fund before he became the environment minister, as he was a key player in it. While he has been the environment minister, and that is currently, he has owned shares in a company that benefited from the green slush fund and also added $750 million of taxpayer money to the fund. The same minister who is contributing to the green slush fund is ruining our forest sector and natural resources while also benefiting from their demise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753265">Let us get into the matter. I am not going to use the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s name, obviously, because we are in the chamber. How was the minister tied to the fund specifically before? Most people will remember the infamous picture of the environment minister in an orange jumpsuit. He was arrested after scaling the CN Tower to deliberately break the law, as “a tool”, as he phrased it. That happened in 2001, just to give a reference for people's timeline, 23 years ago. Eight years after that moment, he would end up lobbying for a company called Cycle Capital. Most members know by now of Cycle Capital and how it has been involved in the green slush fund.</ParaText>

Shockingly, the minister still owns shares in Cycle Capital, but because of the government's not disclosing the documents, we do not know how much. That is really the reason we are here today, why the matter has gone on so long: The redacted documents, the green slush fund documents, that are being covered up today likely have covered up the current minister's involvement in the SDTC and also how much he is benefiting from it personally.</ParaText>

We know that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is generally profiting from the green slush fund, but the documents would get a lot more specific and, I would add, a lot more damning as a result. What we do know is that the company he still owns shares in has directly benefited from the green slush fund, as said the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>: “Cycle Capital, since Andrée-Lise Méthot was put on the board in 2016, tripled in value, from $200 million to $600 million.” Again, the company the minister has shares in has multiplied in value by over 300%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753274">He also said that the fund itself massively expanded under the current Minister of the Environment; “as a cabinet minister of government, he participated in discussions that gave the green slush fund another [three-quarters of a billion dollars], $750 million, of which over a quarter has gone to that company.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753275">It was enough that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> benefited as a lobbyist and as a shareholder in this particular company, but now that he is the minister, he is dumping money into the fund, which is benefiting the company he still has shares in.

              <ParaText id="8753279"> To conclude, there were a bunch of forestry closures, which I have been speaking about and have been doing videos about, in my home province of British Columbia. We have lost 24 mills since 2016. As part of the result of the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, oil and gas is seeing its limitations with emissions caps.

              <ParaText id="8753280">However, the same <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is doing his best to limit our resource development, ruin our forest sector, ruin our oil and gas sector with emissions caps, and bring in the carbon tax, which is making life unaffordable for all Canadians, while he is benefiting from the whole downturn and the demise of the resource sector himself.

              <ParaText id="8753281">This is from a Business in Vancouver, BIV, article: “Canfor's B.C. mill closures prompts call to stabilize timber supply.” This is one way the minister is limiting resource development: initiating and bringing in the 30 per cent by 2030 initiative.

It takes gas from fields in my part of the province in northeastern B.C. and sends it down a pipeline to Kitimat to be exported to the world. By doing that we can actually reduce emissions around the world by up to 50%. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753287">LNG has been a great story for Canada and a great story for us in northeastern B.C. It is also really a service to our allies asking for our natural gas. There have been many countries that have come to ask the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for our natural gas, and he has brushed them off by saying there is no business case for it.

If what the minister is doing is strategic, because some people could accuse him of accidentally ruining the natural resource sector, let us take him at his word. If it is strategic, then it looks like he is deliberately ruining our natural resources sector in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753290">I will move to what the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> has also been saying about the carbon tax. Of course, he is the same minister who has been the face of the carbon tax for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for the last number of years. He was promoting the carbon tax, saying at a House of Commons committee studying emissions policies, “Of course, we're going to continue with the carbon tax because it creates jobs. It helps us to promote investment and reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions”, investments that he himself was benefiting from in the green slush fund.</ParaText>

It is bad enough that he is just taking taxpayer monies in an ethically wrong way. The quote actually says he strategically is doing that, and he is even admitting he is going to be personally benefiting from it: “Of course, we're going to continue with carbon tax because it creates jobs”, which we all know is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753292">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> told the House of Commons committee, and listen to these words about the carbon tax, “It helps us to promote investment”.

              <ParaText id="8753293">What makes it worse, for me, is that I go home to my constituents, who pay their bills either by forestry jobs or by working in the oil and gas sector, and theirs are good jobs that put warm meals on their table and a roof over their head. The same <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, who is strategically trying to ruin the natural gas sector and resource sector, including forestry, is the one who is actually personally benefiting from it as an individual.</ParaText>

We already see directly that the minister has benefited, but we do not know by how much. That is why the documents are redacted, I believe.</ParaText>

Canadians want to know. They deserve to know. The same person who sits across the way, the minister, and the one who sits beside him, the <Affiliation DbId="299995" Type="4">natural resources minister</Affiliation>, together are ruining our country's natural resource sector.</ParaText>

Our limit to get natural gas to the world has been capped by these two individuals, who have been backed and propped up by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is a shame. People need to understand that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> is not only stopping it but also putting dollars in his own bank account by doing so. It is utterly shameful and needs to be exposed. That is why we have spent so much time in this place trying to get to the bottom of the issue, trying to get the unredacted documents and trying to get to the truth of what is going on with SDTC, or the green slush fund, as we call it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753297">In conclusion, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> got rich before he was and he got richer as the environment minister. Canadians are losing their jobs and livelihoods because of the minister's radical policies and the shutting down of our natural resource economy. I started off by saying it has been a win-win-win for the current environment minister and, I would say, the <Affiliation DbId="299995" Type="4">natural resources minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It has been a lose-lose-lose for Canadians and the Canadian taxpayers, who, frankly, pay all our wages in the House. It is shameful. I think Canadians out there are expecting us to get to the bottom of it. I know people watch these videos, and with the amount of views that we are getting, they really want to get to the bottom of this corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753298">The polls are reflecting how unpopular the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the NDP-Liberals across the way are. Canadians are wanting a carbon tax election, and it is because of this kind of stuff and this kind of corruption. We have members from Calgary, members in this chamber, who have talked about the many levels of corruption that the government is involved in. It does not just stop with the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753299">I will summarize the green slush fund for the folks watching out there. If they forgot about the amount of money that we are talking about here, we are not just talking about a few thousand dollars, and that would still be bad. As a quick summary of the scandal, first, at least $390 million has gone to Liberal insiders, including the NDP-Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. Second, they are trying to hide what went on with that transaction and with the whole green slush fund. We know that countless board members of SDTC, the board members themselves, were directly involved in making decisions about who would get the money out of this board. They were making decisions and sending money to their own companies to benefit from those particular decisions, and $400 million is already gone. The minister I referred to topped up the green slush fund with another three-quarters of a billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753300"> Canadians are tired of this kind of corruption, and it is time for us to have a carbon tax election. I look forward to any questions members in the House will have.</ParaText>

There are hopeful, happy days ahead, most definitely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753337">The point that I would like to raise today is just how ironic it is that, even though this is the third time that I am speaking to this motion, I actually have a new fresh list of scandals and corruption relative to the matter at hand, which is, of course, the green slush fund documents. I will start by saying, as I am sure members well know, that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has given me the honour and privilege of being the shadow minister for the Treasury Board, the <Affiliation DbId="300030" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>'s counterpart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753338"> Last week, the <Affiliation DbId="300030" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> made a lot of noise about the release of supply and whether supply would be released so that the government could continue. I think that the official opposition showed its goodwill in coming forward on the motions that were voted on late into the night on Thursday. However, if the President of the Treasury Board is listening, the fastest way that supply could be guaranteed would be to hand over the documents, frankly, to stop this charade of corruption and to really bring this to a close so that we can get on with the governing of Canada. We can work together to continue that, but as long as these documents are outstanding, we will have to continue to bring this to the attention of Canadians. That is how it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753339">That was one incident that has occurred since the last time I spoke on this. As my other colleagues have mentioned, I was very fortunate this morning to be in the room at 7:30 to have a preview of the Auditor General reports. They are public now, so I can talk about them. There certainly were many damning features in the reports on the evaluations by the Auditor General. They included reports on defence procurement and that this procurement is not necessarily being timely or providing value for money. That is no surprise with the government. This is a theme we have seen. We have seen how the management of seniors' programs by the government has been poorly handled. We have many seniors living below the poverty line as a result of the government's not being able to manage its programs for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753340">Most notable, as my colleague mentioned, was the management of the CEBA program during the pandemic. It was a failure of the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. Interesting facts were unearthed in this audit by the Auditor General. Accenture is the company that awarded the contract to itself and provided the vast majority of its work from Brazil. Nine per cent of those who received the money were found to be ineligible. That is really something. Of the hundreds of millions of dollars that were handed out, 9% is really a significant amount. It is no surprise after what we saw with ArriveCAN, or the arrive scam, as we like to call it, that Accenture chose to award those funds to itself. It received $313 million. In other words, 92% of the entire funds in contracts were awarded to those who were delivering CEBA.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753341">Once again, in the Auditor General reports issued and announced this morning, we are seeing the incompetence of the government, with 9% of funds being given to ineligible recipients. Again, the same old fraudsters, scamsters and friends of the Liberal government are getting ahead. Accenture awarded 92% of the contracting to itself and then completed more than a large majority of that contracting out of country, and that is just what we learned this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753342">I have more mismanagement scandals to mention since the last time I was up here to speak. Of course, we have the two-month GST tax holiday. There are actually reports today in the news. The government certainly likes to talk about Conservatives following our leader. We are proud to support the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, but he does, in fact, consult with us and take our opinions into account. I am not sure it is the same for members on the other side of the aisle, as I see some Liberals were not happy they did not get consulted regarding the two-month GST tax trick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753343">This is just another example of the corruption and mismanagement that we are seeing. Of course, this GST implementation is very unfortunate because it forces small businesses to have to make significant administrative changes for a brief period of time and then change them back. If we are talking about the mismanagement of funds, as we are here with the green slush fund, then we also need to mention the amount of government administration it will take to do this two-month tax trick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753344">Of course, we know if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> were really concerned about the well-being of Canadians, he would just eliminate the carbon tax. He has not done that as of yet. Instead, he has just done this two-month tax trick. With this two-month tax trick, the carbon tax would be applied to heating, gas, groceries, farmers, those who deliver the food, the grocers who sell the food, etc. In this case, the Prime Minister took it upon himself to determine the items, specific to Canadians, for which the GST will be taken off, even though it is just for this minimal, two-month period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753345">I think it speaks to the larger problem that we are discussing here, which is the fiscal and economic incompetency of the government, the mismanagement of funds relative to the green slush fund and the Liberals' withholding of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753346">Unfortunately, this goes beyond our borders. We had, of course, our neighbour to the south, the President-elect, indicate that he was going to slap Canada with a 25% tax. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went down to have a conversation with the President-elect, and he did what he does best, which is take selfies with individuals. He did the same thing and was really happy to share this selfie with the world, but he came back empty-handed, as was indicated by my leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. This just shows the mismanagement of money and the mismanagement of our economy, and the green slush fund is just one example of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753347">I have used the first half of my speech to talk about the new scandals and new mismanagement that has occurred, everything from Liberal insiders getting rich with the handing over of $312 million of contracts and expenditures to the two-month tax trick. All of these things are new things since the last time I was here to make some points about the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753348">The 25% tariff would come at a terrible time. As I am sure everyone is aware, the Parliamentary Budget Officer expects the federal government to have a deficit of $46.8 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. That is deeper than the $40 billion forecasted by the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> in the April budget. This is no surprise.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753349">In reviewing some of the documents in the Auditor General's report this morning, it was astounding that some of these initiatives that departments were mandated were not achieved because they did not have the funding. My mind struggles to understand. If the government runs a $46.8-billion deficit, how could it not achieve its mandates? It is one thing to make the decisions and to promise things to Canadians, but then to break these promises is another. A lot of times, as in the issue we are discussing here, which is the inability to hand over the documents, it can be corruption, but in other cases it is just poor planning and mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753350">Again, in reading these Auditor General reports this morning, I was left to wonder whether it is mismanagement. Yes, in some cases I think it is, but again, in the case of Accenture, I think it might be another case of a conflict of interest whereby Liberals are giving money to their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753351">The Conservative opposition has been fantastic in terms of exposing different areas of not only mismanagement but, frankly, poor governance. Another example that comes to mind, in addition to the green slush fund, is how the Liberal government ignored scientists and residents on wildfire risk to Jasper. I think our team did an incredible job of unearthing that. I see the member for <Affiliation DbId="278548" Type="2">Fort McMurray—Cold Lake</Affiliation>, who did fantastic work on it, as did the member for <Affiliation DbId="278568" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278224" Type="2">Sturgeon River—Parkland</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753352">I talked at the beginning about how my constituents, at an annual general meeting this weekend, expressed to me their interest in having a carbon tax election. Speaking of the carbon tax, this is another situation where the government refused to hand over documents. The Liberals declined to release their internal analysis of the economic impacts of carbon pricing and refused to say why they were keeping the data secret, even as they criticized the federal budget watchdog for an error in his analysis of the policy. This is another situation where the government did not hand over documents, similar to the situation we have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753353">There are so many examples of the government not handing over documents that I do not even know which to choose. Another is the WE Charity. I am going back to the Liberal government previous to the current government, where it released thousands of pages of documents related to the WE matter, as the committee requested, but rather than have the independent law clerk redact information, such as cabinet confidences and personal information, the various departments responsible for this program did the blackouts themselves, which was an apparent contravention of the committee's request. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753354">A spokesperson for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office said that the redactions were done by the parliamentary law clerk, who was following the committee's direction to remove documents covered by cabinet confidentiality and personal information about Canadian citizens. However, the law clerk said in a confidential August 18 letter to the clerk of the finance committee that the vast majority of the blackouts had been done by government bureaucrats. I wonder: Under whose direction? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753355">Another situation where we did not receive documents was one I worked on intensely, the ArriveCAN scandal. This was where the Canada Border Services Agency missed the deadline to hand over ArriveCAN invoices and declined to identify subcontractors. I feel as though this is a theme within the government: declining to identify subcontractors in addition to not handing over documents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753356"> I am very grateful that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> is doing such good work on indigenous procurement, because this is similar. We want to ensure that subcontractors and their practices are also evaluated to ensure they meet government guidelines, rules and regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753357"> Of course, the terrible finale of the ArriveCAN scandal was when we had one of the two partners of GC Strategies, Mr. Kristian Firth, here at the bar, in front of Parliament. This is just another example of the lack of oversight of the government and the amount of corruption that we continue to talk about in the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753358"> We also have the situation with the Winnipeg labs where the documents were not handed over. Again, these are the most extreme and delicate of cases, when we look at our national security. In fact, as per usual, the New Democratic Party worked with the Liberals in an effort to shut down a hearing on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Winnipeg lab documents scandal. The documents detailed the infiltration of Canada's highest security lab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753359"> The Prime Minister defied four orders of Parliament and took the House of Commons to court to block the release of these documents. In fact, that was the only time a sitting Prime Minister had done this in Canadian history. Again, this is another example where the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went out of their way, as we continue to discuss here today, on the handing over of documents and the covering up of information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753360"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> attempts to cover up interference at Canada's most secure lab has put the safety and security of Canadians at risk. In 2019, it was revealed scientists working at Canada's high security lab were collaborating clandestinely with the People's Republic of China. Alarm bells were first rung in August 2018, and it took 10 months for these scientists to be marched out of the lab, 10 months after parliamentarians first asked for these documents to be released and the Liberal government refused. Again, we have so many examples here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753361"> Another example of where the Liberals have avoided responsibility would be the purchase of the $9 million residence in New York. We know that Tom Clark approached his good friend, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and asked for a change of residence. Again, the government is passing off this blame and is not taking responsibility. It is passing it onto the bureaucrats when it needs to, once again, take responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753362"> There are endless examples. It is just excuses. As I said, the more recent examples in my speech have happened over the last nine years. However, if we look at just today, we have the CEBA situation, defence procurement, seniors living below the poverty line. Then, this week alone, there is the two-month tax trick and the unwillingness to do anything regarding the 25% tariff from our neighbours to the south.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753363"> I will close with this. Aristotle said that character is revealed through actions. Time and again, the government has revealed its poor character. Since I gave a similar speech on this same subject not long ago, it has remained the same. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753367">Madam Speaker, I also had, coincidentally, an annual general meeting in Vancouver Kingsway this weekend. What I heard from the people who attended my meeting was just how desperately people are struggling right now. The figures back that up: 50% of Canadians are living paycheque to paycheque; one in four parents, according to the Salvation Army, are cutting down on their food intake so that they have enough food for their children; and 80% of Canadians are worried about the holiday spending coming up, yet my hon. colleague voted against a GST cut that would reduce the expenses of an average family by several hundred dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753368"> I was in the House last week when the Conservatives called that chump change. I wonder if she agrees with that.

Does she not agree with me that it shows a disdain for the working and poor people in our country that is unbecoming to this chamber?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753391">Madam Speaker, I would like to add a few things to the excellent question of privilege that was raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> on Friday. I know that the Speaker will address this question of privilege in the coming days, and I wanted to add new elements and raise some important points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753392">The member for London—Fanshawe spoke about Standing Order 16(1), which is on decorum. I will read it: “When the Speaker is putting a question, no member shall enter, walk out of or across the House, or make any noise or disturbance.” That is precisely what happened on Thursday. It was a sad evening in the history of our Parliament. There was utter chaos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753393">Also, the member for London—Fanshawe read an excerpt from the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, which is our procedural bible. In chapter, 3, page 107, it states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753394">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In order to fulfill their parliamentary duties, Members should be able to go about their parliamentary business undisturbed. Assaulting, threatening, or insulting a Member during a proceeding of Parliament, or while the Member is circulating within the Parliamentary Precinct, is a violation of the rights of Parliament.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753395">She also cited Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, chapter 12, page 241, which states, “Any form of intimidation of a Member with respect to the Member's actions during a proceeding in Parliament could amount to contempt.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753396">When we consider all these aspects, there is no doubt that this is indeed a prima facie question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8753397">I would like to add what the Chair could have done, the powers given to the Chair, from a ruling made on March 30, 2000, by the former deputy speaker Peter Milliken, who said the following when there was disorder during a vote in the House of Commons, which is a key part of our work. Deputy Speaker Milliken said, “The Chair will say that if members persist in...some other demonstration of that kind which is inappropriate in the House, the Chair will have no reluctance in directing the clerk to strike the hon. member's name from the list of those who have voted and continue to strike it if the conduct persists and, if necessary, take further measures.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753398">It is very clear that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> could have intervened in what was an absolute collapse of order in the House of Commons during the vote. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> was very clear, as I believe other members have been; they could not even hear whether their name had been called for the vote. That is clearly stopping their ability to do their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753399">We need to get to the real issue here, and I am citing Speaker Regan on November 20, 2018, on the use of alcohol in the House of Commons. He said at that time, in the Speaker's ruling, that “it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that Parliament is a healthy and safe workplace for everyone.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753400"> By no means all Conservative MPs, but some Conservative MPs, had very clearly consumed alcohol before they came into the House. That is something that is strictly prohibited in any workplace. I have worked in factories. I have worked in an oil refinery and in breweries. In no place is it acceptable to come to work having consumed alcohol, especially in excess. In the oil refinery where I worked, if somebody had come to work drunk, they would have been summarily fired because not only are they putting at risk their own lives in a very dangerous work environment, but they are putting in jeopardy the lives of others in the workplace. It is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753401"> As you were aware, Madam Speaker, because the Speaker's office was notified, the pages were withdrawn from the opposition lobby because of safety issues. What an unbelievable circumstance, that the pages who do such incredible work for us, who are part of the work we do each and every day, had to be withdrawn because of the drunk and disorderly conduct of some Conservative MPs. It is absolutely unacceptable that this situation happened and it is unbelievable to me that we have not had Conservative MPs standing and profusely apologizing for their conduct on Thursday night.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753402">I also want to say that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> could have taken action and chose not to on Thursday night, and I find that extremely disappointing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753403"> The reality is that whips have an important role in the House of Commons, and it is a codified role. I want to reference appendix II of the Standing Orders. The whip's role with regard to dealing with allegations of harassment is explicit in the code of conduct for members of the House of Commons. Whips have a semi-codified role with regard to managing the conduct of their members and the appropriateness of their behaviour. For the whip to allow visibly drunk members of the Conservative caucus to come into the House of Commons and disrupt the proceedings in a drunk and disorderly fashion is absolutely unacceptable, and the whip bears responsibility as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753404">When the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> rose on Friday and offered a very fulsome and well-thought-out question of privilege, we saw a number of Conservative MPs rise and spew misinformation and not a single one of them ever responded to the question of privilege. They did not cite a single standing order or a single citation from our procedural bible because they cannot. If they try to do the same thing now, unless they are citing standing orders or citing aspects of the procedural bible that governs our activities, they should not be able to go on at length spewing misinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753405"> My final point is this: In the coming days, the Speaker will be asked to make a decision on this. In my mind, there is no doubt this is a prima facie case of privilege that should come to the House and then the House can decide whether the matter gets referred to the procedure and House affairs committee.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8753406">Madam Speaker, also on this point of order, I would like to respond to the information presented by my colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753407"> I will start with the argument the member made at the end, regarding Conservative MPs factually laying out the case of intimidation, and very bad behaviour by NDP MPs in the House, which included several members of the NDP caucus aggressively gesticulating to a seated Conservative member. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> made an assertion that this was misinformation. I would draw the Speaker's attention to a video on the Twitter feed of one of my colleagues, which clearly shows this did happen. As of right now, the video has been viewed over 600,000 times on various platforms. I present this formally as evidence to refute the assertion of my colleague that somehow stating the behaviour of NDP MPs is misinformation; there is video evidence of what the NDP MPs did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753408"> The second thing the member tried to do was state that, in response to a question of privilege where somebody makes an assertion, we should be censored. I reject that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753409"> Again, with regard to this particular question of privilege, I would reiterate that the video evidence that has been widely disseminated is not of Conservative MPs behaving badly; it is clearly of the NDP. There is a lot of pressure in this place right now. There are a lot of people saying things and I understand it. I understand the NDP and the Liberal government are facing a lot of heat from the Canadian people. The Conservative caucus was not even going to release this video. We took video evidence of it because it was so preposterous, but we thought, “We are not going to raise the temperature in the House.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753410">What has happened and what I would like the Speaker to consider is that the NDP was literally caught on camera. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have seen the NDP. There were at least four MPs, three for sure, who were waving hands in my colleague's face. I must commend him for his neutrality and poise in the situation. Madam Speaker, if you look at that video evidence, you will notice my colleague was incredibly poised. He was incredibly in control of himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753411">I would just flip the narrative back to where it needs to be. A person from the NDP has gotten caught, with his whip. The member talked about our whip, but it was his whip, so I will use his argument against him. He said it is incumbent upon the whip to maintain decorum and order in the House. Well, it was his whip who was actually caught on video waving a finger like this and repeating these phrases ad nauseam over my colleague.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8753422">Madam Speaker, I cannot believe that I am back here today to speak about this motion. I think I spoke to this motion maybe three-plus weeks ago. It could have been four weeks ago. All of this could end if the government simply released the documents. It has stubbornly refused to do so. I can only come up with one reason. in my background as a lawyer, there is only one reason to hide something. The reason we are going to hide something is because it is so bad and so damning that clogging up the House of Commons so that no other work gets done is actually the preferable option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753423">We have to think about that for a minute. Liberals could have released the documents three and a half or four weeks ago and gotten on with their so-called agenda. I think it is a terrible agenda, and I think it has brought us to where we are as a country, where rent has doubled, housing prices have doubled, one in four Canadian parents are skipping meals for their children and two million people are going to food banks. We think it is a terrible agenda, as do most Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753424">The NDP-Liberals are in a coalition. They are not. I cannot keep track. The NDP keeps voting confidence in them, so I guess they are still in an agreement, but maybe they are not, because the NDP <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> ripped up the agreement but keeps voting support, so I do not know. I digress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753425">The NDP-Liberal government has an agenda that it thinks is working. Objectively, it is not but it thinks it is. The Liberals' decision has been that they are not going to bring forward their agenda at all because they will not release these documents. Any reasonable person has to ask themselves this very simple question. Why are they working so hard to hide these documents? A reasonable person, any person, would have to come to the same conclusion that we have, that these documents are so damning, that they are such an indictment of the government and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> in charge, they will move heaven and earth not to release the documents. It is legitimately the only thing we can be left with. This is a scandal-plagued government. We know that. We have had a minister recently resign for a raft of scandals. He took off out of here under a cloud of scandal. Let me say that this will be worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753426">It is across the entire breadth and scope of the government. We just heard today, from the Auditor General, about the CEBA business loans. There was $3.5 billion to 77,000 recipients who were not eligible. There might be some NDP-Liberals over there asking what that has to do with this. It is because this is exactly what happened at SDTC. A whole bunch of Liberal insiders got money with a process that was not the normal process. It was just a printing press for Liberal insiders. We have now looked at the CEBA business loans and we are finding the same thing. Again, this is why they try to cover up everything, because they know the truth is so damning to their incompetence and their corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753427">What is even worse, what the Auditor General revealed today is that the whole CEBA loan process was administered by Accenture in a non-competitive process. The government just gave it the contract. It gave it $313 million out of the $342-million worth of contracts awarded. Guess what? Most of the work it did was done in Brazil. It did not even benefit Canadians. We would think a Canadian program that is being managed by a Canadian company would actually be administered by Canadians. It makes little sense to me. It does not make sense to these guys because literally nothing they do makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753428">As far as these kinds of scandals are concerned, it is kind of a strange place that we are in right now here in Canada. Every week, there is a new scandal that should bring down a government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753429"> It has become so commonplace for the Liberals to be caught with their fingers in the cookie jar that it is hard to shock people, but Canadians should be shocked with how they have behaved with respect to these contracts. Just to reiterate, the Auditor General found in the green slush fund that 82% of the contracts were awarded inappropriately. Now that is an A-. When I was in school, if I got an A- I would be pretty excited. The Liberals have an A- in corruption. I suspect that if they keep working hard at it like they are, they could get that grade up to an A or an A+ before the next election, something they should be really proud of. That is probably what they are working hard on, going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753430">Why are we pressing so hard for these documents? It is because we know these documents are going to be so bad for the government that we have said we will keep debating this issue until it produces them. I am going to read a quote from a whistle-blower on this case so that Canadians who are watching can understand exactly why we are working so hard to get these documents produced. One of the whistle-blowers said that, “The true failure of the situation stands at the feet of our current government”. That is the NDP-Liberal government, the people over there, “whose decision to protect wrongdoers and cover up...over the last 12 months is a serious indictment of how our democratic systems and institutions are being corrupted by political interference.” Let us think about that for a second. That was from a brave whistle-blower who took a risk to expose the corruption. The words used are incredibly powerful and damning. The person went on to say that, “It should never have taken two years for the issues to reach this point. What should have been a straightforward process turned into a bureaucratic nightmare that allowed SDTC to continue wasting millions of dollars and abusing countless employees over the last year.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753431">If we had a government that was not corrupt, someone would have been held accountable. I remember a time when there was this thing called ministerial accountability. Ministers who were found to have engaged in egregious conduct had the honour of resigning. What has happened here? The absolute opposite has happened. What has happened at SDTC is an ongoing, unfolding scandal. A scandal, according to one whistle-blower, that is an indictment of our democratic systems, and our “institutions are being corrupted by political influence”, all to award juicy, big, fat contracts from Liberal insiders to Liberal businesses from a program that was supposed to be monitored by a Liberal minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753432">There are two things that could have happened. First, the minister is absolutely incompetent. Okay, so fire that incompetent minister, right? A minister who allowed this to take place is de facto incompetent. It is their department; they are responsible. There is this thing called ministerial responsibility. If somebody is an incompetent minister and they allow a raft of corruption to take place, corruption so much that it threatens our democratic systems and our institutions, that minister is incompetent and should have resigned. If the minister did not have the honour to resign, they should have been fired. That is scenario number one. Scenario number two, which is a little bit darker, is that the minister actually knew the corruption was taking place, and decided to do nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753433">We must ask ourselves this question. We are four weeks into demanding the release of the documents. The Liberals' entire political agenda has ground to a halt as a result of this. Let us think about the two options that I just presented. Was it that the minister was incompetent, so they are trying to protect incompetence? I do not think so.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753434">Scenario two is the real scenario, that there was widespread corruption that the minister had to have been aware of and turned a blind eye to, just like the whistle-blower said, which is why the Liberals will fight tooth and nail not to release the documents, because they will show how systematic and systemic the corruption in this program was, and that it reached the highest levels of this government. Therefore, they will not release these documents under any circumstances, which is the sad but accurate state of affairs with this NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753435">These NDP-Liberals keep saying is, “Oh, there's no criminality; the Auditor General didn't find any criminality”, and that is true; it is one of the very few accurate statements we get. However, here is what a whistle-blower said about this: “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.” The whistle-blower is saying that they are confident that the RCMP will find criminal wrongdoing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753436">Let us go back to the scenarios I was just talking about before. We have two possible scenarios here on why the Liberals are not releasing the documents. Scenario one, as I said, is that we have a completely incompetent minister who allowed a whole bunch of bad apples to run rampant through this program, doling out cash and making it rain for all of their Liberal insiders and buddies. Scenario two is that we have widespread corruption. Do members remember the sponsorship scandal that brought the end to the previous Liberal government, with people stuffing money in little bags going around the place? The Liberals tried to deny that as well, if I recall. They said, “Oh, there's nothing to see here.” Well, there was a lot to see. So, the second scenario, again, with what this whistle-blower is saying, is that there was criminality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753437">If there was criminality, why do the Liberals want to hide the documents? We have to keep asking this question. This whistle-blower is saying that they are equally confident that there will be criminality found. Why would this person say that? It is because they obviously witnessed the criminality. Now, the criminality could have been from the the people at the department, which may well very have been the case, but if that was the case, why would the Liberals not just release the documents, because they do not have absolute control over the people who work there? The only reason they would be hiding documents that likely would have criminality involved is because the criminality just keeps moving up the food chain to people who knew, and that is the reason why they are refusing to release these documents, and why they have paralyzed this Parliament for the last four weeks in their absolute obstinance to release the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753438">They are so desperate to cover this up that they might have this go on for the next 15 months. Why? They know that the documents will bring an end to their government; they are that damning. It is the only explanation that I can see. Again, the Liberals said that there was no criminality, which is one of their defences in this. Then they said that there was no criminal intent, which is the other one. Well, it is interesting because there was a whistle-blower who talked about criminal intent; imagine that. The whistle-blower said, “I know that the federal government, like the minister, has continued saying that there was no criminal intent and nothing was found, but I think the committee would agree that they're not to be trusted on this situation.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753439">Sometimes we get real pearls of wisdom from people who come forward and make statements on this. I think the committee would agree that the Liberals are not to be trusted on this situation. However, what this Liberal government is asking Canadians to do is to trust it on these documents. We have produced documents and we have redacted 80%, or whatever it is, of the documents: “Just trust us. There is nothing damning in these redactions. It's just standard procedure.” I think what we have learned from these NDP-Liberals is that they absolutely cannot be trusted with these kinds of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753440"> We heard way back in the day with respect to Jody Wilson-Raybould that the story in The Globe and Mail was false. Do members remember that was what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said? Then, remarkably, the story was actually true.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753441">When we look at whether the Liberals should be trusted on this, I think there is no one who still wants to trust them. There might be a few hard-core Liberal supporters in downtown Toronto, but anywhere else in the country, the trust in these guys is at zero, as it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753442"> The whistle-blower, Witness 1, goes on to say, “I would happily agree to whatever the findings are by the RCMP, but I...wouldn't trust that there isn't any criminality unless the RCMP is given full authority to investigate.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753443"> Again, the whistle-blower is saying that they cannot trust them, that they think there is criminality here and that the RCMP should investigate for criminality. We go back to asking ourselves why they will not release the documents. I have said this several times, but it is really important that this point hits home: They will not release the documents, despite four-plus weeks of not getting their agenda through Parliament, because they just know the degree of criminality that is going to be found in these documents and how damning it will be for their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753444">I will phrase this in a way that everyone can understand. The government has been mired in scandals for the past two years. It is not new to scandal; it is not something new or shocking. One would think that, at a certain point, the Liberals would say that another scandal is no big deal. They would just get those documents out and say it would blow over in a couple of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753445">However, they do not. The Liberals are still obstructing Parliament and not producing the documents. It goes back to the fact that this is not an everyday, run-of-the-mill scandal. It is actually really sad when we have to say that phrase, “not an everyday, run-of-the-mill scandal” by a government. It is because of how many scandals and how corrupt the government has been proven to be that we get to use that phrase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753446">It is not a run-of-the-mill scandal, however, or the Liberals would just release the documents. They would do what they normally do: a Friday evening document dump. We all know it. That is when the government takes out the trash. It puts something out at 5 p.m. on a Friday, usually on a long weekend, such as Thanksgiving or the August long weekend, because the Liberals know Canadians are not paying attention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753447">However, the government did not even do a document dump on this. Again, it is because the Liberals know that what is in these documents will bring about the end of the government. We know there is going to be an end. When we have a carbon tax election, which is coming, that will be the end for the Liberals. They just want to desperately hold on as long as they can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753448"> The NDP wants to hold on as long as it can because the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> needs his pension. That is why the NDP keeps propping up the Liberals at every opportunity. The New Democrats say they ripped up the agreement, but they prop the Liberals up. Unfortunately, the government is going to keep going. If it released these documents, it would actually be the end. Even the NDP would not be able to prop the Liberals up anymore, because the documents are so bad. That is why they are not releasing the documents. It is why we are where we are today. It brings me no joy to be here speaking about this another time. The Liberals have made this choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753449"> The conflicts that go on in this program are really unbelievable. We now have another minister mired in scandal. First, we have the minister who was responsible for SDTC; we have come to the conclusion that he is either incompetent or involved in this scheme. We now also have the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, who was a strategic adviser for Cycle Capital Management, which got a whole bunch of money from the green slush fund. I wonder how that happened. Given that point, I wonder why the Liberals do not want to release the documents. There are at least two ministers who we know will be very badly exposed by the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753450"> I will end with this: This has gone on long enough. It is very simple. All the Liberals have to do is release the unredacted documents, and we can get back to the business of the House. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753487">Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the massive scandal at Sustainable Development Technology Canada, more appropriately known as the billion-dollar Liberal green slush fund. This is a scandal involving $400 million in taxpayer dollars that improperly went out the door, according to the Auditor General. Of that, $330 million involved conflicts of interest involving board members; that was186 conflicts of interest and multiple violations of the SDTC act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753488"> In the face of such a scandal, Canadians can rightly ask how it is that board members who were Liberal insiders engaged in conflicts of interest funnelled tens of millions of dollars into companies that they had interests in and got away with it for so long. Very simply, how this happened and why they got away with it for so long is that, after nine years of the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we have a government in which there is a culture of rot and corruption that goes right to the top, to the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753489"> This is a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who fired his Attorney General, Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she defied his unethical and unlawful orders to interfere in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. This is a Prime Minister who hid behind cabinet confidence to obstruct an RCMP criminal investigation into his potential wrongdoing. This is a Prime Minister who has the distinction of being the first Prime Minister in Canadian history to be found guilty of violating the Conflict of Interest Act, not once but twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753490">This reflects what we have seen at SDTC, and it also perhaps explains why, as we speak, there are sitting members of cabinet who, like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, have been found guilty of violating the Conflict of Interest Act, including the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>. I would also mention the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, who was found guilty of breaking the Conflict of Interest Act while he served as parliamentary secretary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753491">Then there is the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, who two weeks ago resigned from cabinet in disgrace. This is someone who got caught violating the Conflict of Interest Act when he was involved in the operations of a shady PPE company in direct violation of the act while he sat in cabinet. More than that, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>'s company has been ordered by Alberta courts to pay back clients nearly $8 million for ripping them off. It faces seven lawsuits alleging fraud, and the Edmonton police have opened a criminal investigation into the member's company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753492">As such, all of this is to say that there is a culture of rot, corruption and conflict from top to bottom in this government, and it has been happening from practically day one, when this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. Consistent with that rotten culture, it comes as no surprise that former Liberal minister, Navdeep Bains, when he was the industry minister, appointed a conflicted person as the chair of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753493"> Annette Verschuren was someone who no doubt had a fair amount of business experience, but she had, as I alluded to, a major problem. She had a conflict of interest insofar as her company was receiving $2.2 million from SDTC. That is a blatant conflict of interest, and it ought to have immediately disqualified her from that role. However, Navdeep Bains, being in the cabinet of a corrupt and conflicted government, said conflicts be damned, and he appointed Annette Verschuren as chair. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753494">It was from that time onward that we saw the self-dealings, the conflicts and the mismanagement that were identified in the Auditor General's report. Almost all of it occurred under the chair at that time, Annette Verschuren, someone who was handpicked by Navdeep Bains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753495">At or around the time that Verschuren was appointed by Bains to serve as chair, the SDTC board adopted a conflict of interest policy that encouraged corruption. Just to give the House an illustration of what was contained in this policy, it permitted directors to buy and sell securities within companies funded by SDTC within three days of a public announcement. To illustrate this policy in action, a board member could sit in and vote to fund a company for a project that would be announced on Monday and the same director could go and buy and sell securities in that company on Thursday. It is akin to insider trading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753496">At the public accounts committee, the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278326" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> took great exception when I characterized it as that. I would remind the member, through you, Madam Speaker, that it is completely at odds with the rules of the Ontario Securities Commission for publicly traded companies, rules relating specifically to insider trading and self-dealing. It is no wonder because, as I said, it is akin to insider trading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753497">Pursuant to the rules of the Ontario Securities Commission, the directors of those publicly traded companies can only buy and sell shares on a limited basis outside of the quarterly financial reporting periods. However, here we have a policy that basically allowed members to get rich with insider information. It is total corruption. If the member for <Affiliation DbId="278326" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> wants to dispute that it is insider trading, it certainly is corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753498">Not only did the policy give a green light to, essentially, insider trading, but it also violated the standards provided for in the Conflict of Interest Act. Why is that a problem? Among the problems with that is that seven of the 14 board members were appointed by cabinet. They were GIC appointments and were therefore bound by the Conflict of Interest Act, yet we had a policy at SDTC that violated the Conflict of Interest Act and also violated the SDTC act, specifically subsection 12(2), which states, “no director shall profit or gain any income or acquire any property from the Foundation or its activities.” However, that is precisely what happened again and again at SDTC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753499">The Auditor General found that five out of the 15 board members, a third of the board, had interests in companies that were being funded by SDTC while they sat on the board in blatant conflicts of interest and in blatant violation of the SDTC act. One such example involved the chair herself, Ms. Verschuren. She not only voted but actually moved two motions to funnel $38.5 million into SDTC companies under the guise of their being so-called COVID relief payments, payments that the Auditor General determined to be improper and outside of the scope of the contribution agreements with the Department of Industry. Therefore, it was $38.5 million of mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753500"> This is pretty bad, but even worse, arguably, is that $220,000 of that went into Ms. Verschuren's own company, NRStor. As I noted, Ms. Verschuren is a woman with vast business experience and vast experience sitting on corporate boards. It should not take someone with that experience, and frankly it is a matter of common sense, to know it is completely unethical and a conflict of interest to sit on a board and move a motion to funnel money into one's own company. Not only is it a conflict of interest, but I would say there is another word for it. It is called stealing. It is stealing taxpayers' money, and Ms. Verschuren was found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner for that blatant conflict. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753501">Then there is Andrée-Lise Méthot. She is a close associate of the radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. Ms. Méthot came to the public accounts committee and admitted that SDTC funnelled $10.4 million into companies she had interests in. She said that she identified she had a conflict and left the room, but of course that is not good enough. Think about it. It is not good enough in that context for a board member to say, “I have a conflict; therefore, I am going to leave the room,” and the board votes to funnel $10.4 million into their companies. Then the board member comes back and another board member leaves the room and the board votes to funnel money into that member's companies. That occurred again and again, 186 times. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. It speaks to a culture of total corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753502">Yes, Ms. Méthot can argue that she technically recused herself, but come on. It is further not good enough because it violates the SDTC act in terms of not profiting, not gaining and not acquiring property. That is strictly prohibited, but there was Méthot cashing in $10.4 million in unlawful payments approved by the board. When I put it to her at committee that she had blatantly violated the SDTC act, she had no answer. It was almost as if she was taken aback, which speaks to the degree to which there was a culture of conflict and entitlement that permeated the SDTC board for so many years under former Liberal minister Bains' watch and the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s watch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753503">The ministers say they did not really know anything about it and that SDTC is an arm's length foundation. That is hardly an excuse. We are talking about a billion taxpayer dollars, and we have a former minister and a current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who are basically trying to wash their hands clean and saying to forget about the $400 million, forget about the $330 million involving the conflicts of board members and forget the 186 conflicts of interest. They say that it was not their responsibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753504">The Auditor General's report is an indictment of the lack of oversight provided under the two ministers, Bains and the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. It is an absolute indictment, the report, but it is worse than that. There was someone who, according to the deputy minister, was the department's eyes and ears at every one of these green slush fund board meetings, the assistant deputy minister Andrew Noseworthy. He sat there as there were 186 conflicts of interest and as tens of millions of dollars were funnelled into the companies of board members, and he appeared before the public accounts committee last Thursday. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753505"> His excuse was that he had no independent way of verifying conflicts of interest. There were 186 conflicts of interest sitting there, but he had no way to determine that there were conflicts of interest. I said to him that this was impossible, that it could not be true because there was plenty of evidence before committee that the practice at SDTC was for an agenda to be sent out weeks before the meeting. Board members were then invited to identify proposed projects in which they had conflicts of interest. At the beginning of each meeting, the secretary would then read the the names of those members who identified conflicts of interest, while Noseworthy was sitting there. Noseworthy, after he was caught misleading the committee, came up with the response that it was not his fiduciary duty to report on these conflicts and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753506"> It speaks not only to a culture of rot, conflict and corruption that goes right to the top of SDTC's leadership with Ms. Verschuren, with members of the cabinet and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but it also speaks to a complete level of contempt for taxpayer money by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753507"> I am just flabbergasted by that testimony, but perhaps I should not be flabbergasted, because, again, it goes back to the culture of corruption that is so embedded in the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753508">Here we are, more than two months after the House ordered the government to turn over all documents relating to SDTC so that they in turn could be turned over by the law clerk to the RCMP and we still do not have the documents. It begs the question, why? The only plausible explanation is that what is contained in those documents is really bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753509"> Based upon the Auditor General's report, we know that there was a total lack of oversight at SDTC. We know that in some instances the ministers of the government encouraged or tolerated conflicts of interest, such as Bains handpicking Verschuren to serve as chair, notwithstanding that she had a conflict of interest. We know that these ministers had to have known that all was not well at SDTC, given the fact that they had eyes and ears sitting in on each of these meetings. We also know from the whistle-blower that despite the minister's assertion that he took action when he learned of wrongdoing, that was not so, that the minister was more interested in protecting himself and the insiders who got rich, and was prepared to take steps to cover up this massive scandal for as long as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753510">The government's refusal to turn over the documents, to black out thousands and thousands of pages is a continuation of the cover-up. The bottom line is that heads need to roll. There needs to be accountability and we need to get fully to the bottom of this massive scandal. If there is criminal wrongdoing, then the RCMP needs that evidence and taxpayers need to be made whole from the Liberal insiders. As long as the government continues to block and obstruct the House order, we will continue to stand up for taxpayers and demand the release of the documents.</ParaText>

These efforts and many more have been implemented to tackle crime and invest in public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753543">I would like to recognize the dedicated work of 31 Division in Humber River—Black Creek, especially Superintendent Mandeep Mann, Inspector Jack Gurr and officer Melody Carroll.

It requires the active participation of all of us in Humber River—Black Creek, including countless community groups and grassroots organizations that play an invaluable role in this effort.

It highlights serious inefficiencies, a lack of government oversight and $3.5 billion in losses to ineligible recipients. How did we get here? The report outlined that the third party program administrator, Accenture, set its own pricing, wrote its own contracts, ran procurement and received 19 uncompetitive contracts for $313 million.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753739">Mr. Speaker, I am rising to add my perspective on the question of privilege raised on Friday by my colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation>. The <Affiliation DbId="278386" Type="2">opposition deputy House leader</Affiliation> explicitly named me and put completely false information on the record regarding my conduct in the lobby as an attempt to deflect from the deliberate, premeditated plan to disrupt the voting proceedings in the House. I am rising to correct the record and put on the record what actually happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753740">Prior to the vote, on my way to the washroom, I overheard the Conservative lobby staff instruct Conservative MPs to disrupt proceedings in the chamber once the NDP rose to vote. He then egged them on and said, “The NDP deserves it.” I shook my head, made a comment under my breath and left the lobby. Not only was there no intimidation, but there was no heated exchange of words between me and that staffer. In other words, the Conservative staff was suggesting the NDP deserves to have its House privilege violated, in clear contravention of section 16 of the Standing Orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753741">When the vote took place, sure enough, the Conservatives carried out their premeditated plan to deliberately violate the privilege of NDP members. During the vote, I was not able to hear if my vote was registered and I did not know if in fact it had been or not. I stood for some time watching and waiting. After the vote, a number of MPs and staff had gathered, and I repeated that the staffer in question had instructed Conservative MPs to disrupt the House, which he affirmed. I also raised this with the Conservative whip and asked if it amounted to bullying, to which he responded that he knew nothing about it. The question is, if he knew nothing about it, then who instructed the Conservative lobby whip staff to disrupt the House? Was it the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>? If not, did the staff act on their own?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753742">I understand what happens in the lobby is not subject to debate in the House, but the member for <Affiliation DbId="278386" Type="2">Mégantic—L'Érable</Affiliation> brought it up, and I need to defend myself and put the truth on the record. The member's fabrication does not end there. In his comment, he said an NDP staffer had to “physically take hold of” me. This is absolutely untrue. When I returned from the washroom and walked through the lobby, I was not manhandled by anyone. On the contrary, I proactively reported what I had overheard to the NDP lobby staff, who were already aware at the time that the Conservatives intended to violate Standing Order 16 by disrupting the House when the NDP got up to vote. This was reported to the clerk so the Speaker would be informed and aware.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753743">It is deeply disturbing for the Conservatives to resort to fabricating such a story to malign me and the hard-working staff of the NDP. Mr. Speaker, not only are the member's comments completely untrue, but I think as you deliberate, you should be aware of the premeditation and intentional nature of the disruption of Standing Order 16 by the Conservative MPs on Thursday. The truth needs to be told and I hope this information will assist you in that deliberation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753750">However, I could not help but stand up and respond to a few of the erroneous points the NDP member just raised. I want to thank my Bloc Québécois colleague for pointing out that the New Democrats are often selective in their sanctimony about decorum in this place. They are often extremely noisy, heckling members when they have the floor, including during votes. They have suddenly found their “holier than thou” gene on this type of thing when they are often guilty of it themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753751">With regard to the specific allegations, I can tell the NDP member there are witnesses who saw everything our colleagues have pointed out. As well, we have videotape of the erratic and unhinged behaviour the NDP members exhibited when they marched up to the Speaker's chair. If she wants to talk about decorum, this was marching up to the Speaker's chair, hurling insults at the Speaker, after the House had already been adjourned, to the point where NDP members had to be taken back because they were violating the space of members of our side, most of whom were seated, calm and collected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753752">I do not know what happened to cause such erratic and unhinged behaviour on the part of the NDP. I will not speculate on that. However, I will be coming back with a more substantive response, including the eyewitness testimony of members who were in the lobby, who heard that member hurl abuse and profane and vulgar language at a staffer. An elected MP yelling insults at and using profane language against a staffer would also rise to the level of unparliamentary behaviour. As the member pointed out, it happened in the lobby, not in the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753753">I would just point out that it is your job, Mr. Speaker, to enforce decorum during votes and during speeches, which you did that night. The Speaker made a judgment call on aspects of decorum that evening. Other than that, I believe that is where the matter should rest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753754">It was only after the NDP started making false and defamatory accusations, which I dare say they would never repeat outside the chamber, that we were forced to show Canadians the actual truth about what happened that evening, which consisted of NDP members of Parliament completely losing their cool, coming over in an aggressive and hostile manner, hurling abuse and yelling at members who were seated, calm and collected. That is the true story about what happened that night, and we will absolutely correct the record.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753764">People with disabilities living in poverty experience the cruelty of clawbacks first-hand. Whenever they get the slightest increase in income, their critical government benefits are reduced. The skimming of benefits that they are entitled to pushes them farther behind. The era of perpetuating poverty through the Liberals' cruel and callous clawbacks, and those of the Conservatives before them, has to end. The negative impacts go farther than just bad economic policy. It is bad social policy too. People with disabilities are prevented from having a live-in relationship, marrying, leaving an abusive relationship or even taking on roommates; if they do, they risk losing their critical benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753765">With my bill, in relation to the Canada disability benefit, which is already woefully inadequate, the government can amend and modernize the policy to bring in a new era of disability benefits that empowers people instead of punishing them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753776"> This is why it is so important that the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> appear at the INAN committee. Previous to that, he was scheduled to appear as minister. The NDP-Liberal government has tried to say that, since he is no longer a sitting minister, he does not need to appear at committee to answer the allegations made against him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753777">That is simply unacceptable. It does not change that he was a long-serving member of the corrupt NDP-Liberal government and that there are three very significant issues he needs to answer for to the Canadian public, and most of all, to indigenous communities. One thing colleagues of mine in the House have really highlighted is that impersonating an indigenous person or an indigenous company is a severe offence. It is fraudulent, and it is something that is just simply not acceptable for anybody in Canada, let alone a sitting minister of the NDP-Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753778">We have also heard that the NDP-Liberals are trying to do something to obfuscate, and that is to have the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> appear but do it with all the current and relevant ministers to INAN at the same time. That would swamp the meeting, with three ministers and the member for Edmonton Centre appearing all at once. We are asking and calling on the former minister to appear individually to answer questions on what he is done. Simply put, the amount of time he will have at committee will be well used to appear individually, at least for an hour, if not longer, to try to answer some of the allegations made against him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753779">It is a concern for Canadians across the country. We spoke about the green slush fund before and this corruption within the front benches. Again, it is not just the odd allegation here and there. It is corruption at the highest level from sitting ministers of the government. It was only recently, just a few weeks ago, that the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> was cut loose, as the news article stated. He held on for many months. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> kept him in his spot, regardless of the allegations. More allegations started to pop up as a result, and it got even worse as the member was allowed to remain in his minister's chair. I give credit to my colleagues for putting pressure on the former minister. It was said that the Prime Minister asked him to step down or resign, or however anyone wants to phrase it. It was really after the opposition, the Conservatives on this side, caused so much pressure with the Prime Minister and Canadians across the country. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753780"> It is even reflected in the polls. When we look at the polls across the country, the Liberals and the NDP are really struggling because of these kinds of allegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753781">It is not as though they deal with allegations quickly. They deal with them after months and months of pressure, of people watching videos on YouTube and social media, asking why the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> is still sitting when he is under this cloud of allegations and suspicion around some pretty significant issues. Impersonating an indigenous person in Canada, and doing so as a sitting minister, is really beyond the pale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753782">This is why it is necessary for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> to come to committee. He needs to give his responses to the questions from our members. This needs to happen with a full meeting, not as an attachment with a bunch of other ministers there getting asked questions at the same time. We are asking for him to appear as an individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753783">Canadians and indigenous people across the country deserve to have him answer for what he has done and maybe clarify what he was trying to do with what ended up happening, what the allegations are. He has spoken many times in the House, and he has never been able to get out of the shadow of these allegations. As I said before, the cloud has gotten darker over him, whether in terms of the other Randy, GHI as a co-owned company or bidding on government contracts as a sitting minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753784">We just spoke about it at length for 20 minutes. The sitting <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> was doing the exact same thing. It is a sad state of affairs when this acceptable corruption is in the front benches of the NDP-Liberals today. We look forward to getting a chance to ask some tough questions of the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation>. It was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said, “sunny ways.” I think we all remember that from 2015. The best thing for integrity of the system is to shine a light, to have no secrets. This was the Prime Minister's saying. He talks about slogans of ours; “sunny ways” was his slogan. Where has that gone today? All we have is government cover-up after cover-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753785">The Speaker is even challenging the government to produce unredacted documents to the green slush fund. It is not just that we are trying to shine a light on some of these accusations of a current minister and the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but it needs to actually see the light of day. We need to see the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> in the INAN committee. He needs to answer for the serious allegations against him. I think indigenous people across the country and Canadians at large are expecting that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753786">How could a sitting minister so obviously do things that are fraudulent and keep being able to do so for as long as he was? It was only after relentless pressure from the Conservative Party on this side, as well as facts that just kept churning up as time went on that, finally, as the article said, “The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">prime minister</Affiliation> and the MP [for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>] agreed that [the MP] will step away from cabinet effective immediately.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753787">It is a challenge for him to actually do this. In the article, it said the MP from <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> “will focus on clearing the allegations made against him”, as “a spokesperson for [the] Prime Minister...said in a statement”. Here is a great opportunity to do exactly that as an individual: clearing the allegations against him.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753788"> I am now prepared to rule on the point of order raised on November 21, 2024, by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278653" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation> regarding the designation of the final four supply days for the period ending on December 10, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753789">In his point of order, the member for La Prairie asked whether the Chair would intervene to designate the remaining opposition days in the hypothetical case that the two questions of privilege before the House remain under consideration through the end of the current supply period. The member said that the Standing Orders provide for four more opposition days this fall and that, in the past, the Chair has designated days to meet the requirements of the Standing Orders. He also raised the possibility of temporarily setting aside the questions of privilege if it is necessary for the making of appropriations.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8753790">In my statement of November 21, 2024, on the same topic, I encouraged the House leaders to discuss a solution that would enable the House to reconcile these various responsibilities. The discussions do not seem to have been productive. Although the government has designated three opposition days, including today's, the Chair notes that the House has been unable to take up the business of supply at the required time. The House remains in the situation described by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278653" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753791">The House is solely responsible for granting supplies to the Crown, as provided by Standing Order 80(1). To that end, at the start of each session, it establishes a continuing order of the day for the consideration of supply. That order, as <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, explains at page 838, “remains on the agenda as an item of Government Orders and may be taken up at any time at the government’s discretion.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753792">In other words, the designation of the days allotted to the business of supply is normally a prerogative of the government, and this business is considered during Government Orders.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8753793"> The House executes its supply responsibilities through a very specific mechanism, which is described in Standing Order 81. Adopting one or more appropriations bills granting sums to defray charges and expenses of the federal public administration is the final step of that process. For the current supply period, such a bill must be adopted by December 10. Under Standing Order 81(17), the Chair is required, no later than the last day of this period, to interrupt proceedings and put every question necessary to dispose of these appropriations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753794">That said, one principle of our parliamentary government is that members have the right to air grievances before considering the government's financial requirements. There exists a vital balance between grievances and supply, the former being considered on supply days. What is to be done if the government is unable to designate those days?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753795"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278653" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation> raised the Chair's role in this situation by citing an important precedent. On Thursday, March 22, 1990, a dispute between the government and the opposition prevented the last two opposition days that could be allotted for the supply period ending on March 26 from being designated. Consequently, on that day, Speaker Fraser designated Friday, March 23, and Monday, March 26, 1990, as opposition days. In a ruling rendered on March 26, 1990, on page 9759 of the Debates, he explained, and I quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753796">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Standing Orders list the number of allotted days there will be in each supply period and where the Government has failed to designate sufficient days to meet the requirements of the Standing Orders, by attrition those days left in the period must become allotted days, when no other alternative is possible in order to comply with the Standing Orders.... [H]ence Friday and today had to become opposition days, whether specifically designated by the Government or not.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753797">However, the House was not considering questions of privilege when Speaker Fraser had to rule on the issue.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8753798">In the statement of November 21, 2024, the Chair outlined the House's responsibility to grant supplies, in accordance with the specific mechanisms provided by the Standing Orders. The Chair also remarked that a privilege motion must take priority over all other orders of the day; still, this practice is not absolute. As we have seen on a few occasions this fall, the House may, through a special order or under a unique specific standing order, require a particular action to be taken at a particular time. For example, pursuant to Standing Order 66, the House resumed consideration of motions to concur in committee reports after debate on them had been adjourned, even though these motions were orders of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753799">In the same vein, the continuing order of the day for supply enables, and in fact the Standing Orders require, the House to dispose of supply matters by December 10, 2024. Despite the questions of privilege before the House, the Chair must conclude that the provisions of the Standing Orders governing the consideration of supply remain in effect. The Chair further concludes that the balance between the allotted days and the adoption of appropriations must be maintained and that, as a result, the remaining supply days must take place.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8753800"> Since four supply days are yet to be designated and 48 hours’ notice is required for opposition motions, unless the House decides otherwise, the Chair declares that the last four sitting days in the current period—namely, Thursday, December 5, Friday, December 6, Monday, December 9, and Tuesday, December 10, 2024—will be allotted days.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8753801"> During the sittings of Thursday, December 5; Friday, December 6; and Tuesday, December 10, consideration of the questions of privilege under Orders of the Day will resume once the House has finished the debates on the business of supply, if possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753802"> As for the sitting of Monday, December 9, the questions of privilege will be taken up at the start of the sitting and considered until Orders of the Day are called at noon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753820">Madam Speaker, today, I rise in the House of Commons to address a matter that has serious implications for public trust, accountability and the integrity of our democratic institutions. It is a matter that speaks to the very principles that Canadians hold dear, the principles of transparency, honesty and the fair application of our laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753821"> This is an issue that is both deeply troubling and critically important to the future of our nation. It is an issue that strikes at the heart of fairness and the actions we expect from those in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753822"> We live in a country that prides itself on its commitment to reconciliation with indigenous peoples. We recognize that this is a journey, a process of healing, understanding and building trust between indigenous communities and the Canadian government. However, this process is only meaningful when it is rooted in honesty and respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753823"> The issue at hand is the controversial conduct surrounding the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">former minister of employment</Affiliation>, the member for Edmonton Centre, and his past business dealings, specifically his connection to Global Health Imports, a company he co-owned. This matter not only raises questions about potential conflicts of interest, but it also brings to the forefront serious concerns regarding the manipulation of indigenous business procurement programs for personal and political gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753824"> This issue calls into question both the ethical standards expected of our public officials and the integrity of programs designed to benefit indigenous entrepreneurs and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753825"> We are faced with a troubling situation in which an individual, a public servant no less, is accused of exploiting the very tools that were meant to uplift and empower indigenous communities for personal advantage. The procurement strategy for indigenous businesses was established by the government to ensure that indigenous communities could participate meaningfully in federal contracting opportunities, and yet we are now confronted with the possibility that this program is being misused by individuals with questionable motives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753826"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> has long portrayed himself as an ally of indigenous communities and, at times, a person of indigenous descent. However, his claims about his heritage have shifted dramatically over time, raising serious questions about the sincerity and accuracy of his statements. In 2017, the member referred to himself as non-status adopted Cree, tracing his ancestry to his great-grandmother, who he claimed was Cree. This claim was repeated in Parliament, where he spoke proudly of his heritage as part of his personal narrative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753827">However, just a few years later, the member changed his story. In an interview in 2021, he stated that he was a white, cisgender member of the community. He publicly distanced himself from any indigenous identity, acknowledging instead that his heritage was tied to a status Métis family member through adoption. The stark shift was quite sudden, and the timing of these changes raises questions about his true understanding of his heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753828">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, along with his former business partner, Stephen Anderson, co-founded Global Health Imports at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company initially focused on distributing personal protective equipment, such as masks, gloves and face shields. It was, at the time, a business venture that appeared to be in line with the urgent needs of the day, as the global health crisis required swift and wide-ranging action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753829"> However, the issue arose when GHI began to identify itself as a wholly indigenous-owned business in federal procurement bids, claims that were made to gain access to preferential treatment under Canada's indigenous procurement programs. These claims were made even though neither the member nor Anderson appeared to have verifiable indigenous heritage that met the strict criteria for participation in the PSIB.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753830"> While the government's procurement strategy allows for preferential treatment to companies that are generally genuinely indigenous-owned, it requires that such companies meet clear criteria, such as being at least 51% owned by indigenous individuals. As it turned out, neither the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> nor Stephen Anderson could demonstrate they actually met that requirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753831"> Global Health Imports, as we all know, was never registered on the official list of eligible indigenous businesses. Furthermore, neither the member nor Anderson ever substantiated their indigenous heritage when questioned.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753832"> The core of the issue is the deliberate misrepresentation of GHI's ownership. By falsely claiming to be indigenous-owned, the owner sought to leverage government programs meant for indigenous people, diverting opportunities and funds from businesses that genuinely meet the criteria. This raises significant questions about the truthfulness of the claims made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> and the appearance of a deliberate attempt to misappropriate federal resources, especially given that those claims were central to securing lucrative government contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753833"> The government has been unequivocal about the need for companies to prove their status before accessing these very programs and yet there appears to be no official follow-up or verification by the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> or her department in this case. The reality is that GHI did not meet the criteria to qualify for indigenous procurement programs. This is not just a matter of a failed business bid; this is a matter of ethical conduct. This is about whether the rules governing indigenous procurement are being followed and whether those who falsely claim indigenous identity are allowed to exploit the very programs meant to support indigenous businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753834">Indigenous leaders, such as Shannin Metatawabin, the CEO of the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association, have voiced their concerns about this kind of behaviour. He stated that these incidents are symptomatic of broader problems within the PSIB, noting that fraudulent claims of misrepresentation are undermining the program and ultimately harming the various communities the PSIB is meant to support. This lack of transparency and accountability is quite troubling. Arthur Schafer, the director of the Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics at the University of Manitoba, has argued that in order for the programs like the PSIB to remain effective, the government must hold individuals accountable when they misrepresent themselves as indigenous or try to exploit these programs for personal gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753835"> As we move forward, there are several lessons we must learn from this controversy. First, we must demand greater transparency from public officials, in particular when they are involved in decisions that affect vulnerable communities. Second, we must strengthen the safeguards in place to prevent the exploitation of procurement programs meant for indigenous businesses. The public must have confidence that all elected officials are held to the highest standard of ethical conduct and that means an independent, thorough investigation into the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>'s actions and his potential breaches of the Conflict of Interest Act. We must have transparency into whether his financial interests in GHI influenced the awarding of government contracts and whether any rules were broken in that process. It means we must also examine and even re-examine the strength of our ethics laws and those covering indigenous peoples, including the indigenous procurement programs, and ensure that these programs are not abused by officials looking to profit at the expense of indigenous communities. If they are, we need to know what measures we can take to strengthen our systems, close those loopholes and ensure that these programs are used for that intended purpose to empower and uplift indigenous peoples, not enrich the privileged few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753836"> We cannot ignore these concerns. The very integrity of our democratic institutions depends on the people who hold positions of power living up to the highest ethical standards. It is time for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> to answer for his actions and for the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that this type of behaviour is not tolerated in the future. Of course, as we look into the broader implications of the case, we must ask ourselves how many other cases like this are out there. How many more individuals are attempting to pass themselves off as indigenous to access resources and advantages that should be reserved for the very communities we are striving to support?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753857"> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to try to explain, as best as I can, why we are having this debate this afternoon. It is quite unfortunate, but the Conservatives have been focused on character assassination, even back 10 years ago when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation> was first elected as leader. Absolutely nothing has changed over the last 10-plus years. They identify an individual and then attack the very character of that person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753858">In the many years that I have known the member from <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, I never had him come up to me in any fashion whatsoever to try to give any sort of an impression that he was indigenous himself. I really look at a lot of the things the Conservatives do as ways to try to discredit individuals inside the chamber. Quite frankly, it is at a very great cost. I often say, which Hansard will clearly demonstrate, that over the years, the Conservative Party has focused on destroying the characters of elected officials in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a government that continue to be focused on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753859">While Conservatives try to sidestep important issues and bring in character assassinations, as a government, we have been focused on Canadians to ensure they are a part of the solution in building a stronger, healthier economy. We are focusing in on Canada's middle class, and those aspiring to be a part of it, while focusing on ensuring that we have an economy that works for all Canadians. That has been the government's focus for years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753860">The type of response we get from members of the Conservative Party is for them to consistently attack individuals. There might be the odd one that steps up to the plate to say something that is a little bit more constructive, but that is discouraged in the Conservative caucus. There are Conservative MPs on the other side who have made it very clear that they do not have a choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753861"> There are people in the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation>'s office who actually follow members, who stalk them to see what they are saying. That made national news last week with a story about the degree to which Conservative MPs are being stalked within their own caucus. They get stars if they do something right, and they get some of those stars taken away if they do something wrong. For example, if they talk to Liberal members of Parliament, that is a bad thing, according to the Conservative caucus and their new rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753862">If Conservative members want to get a star, well, they can maybe attack the character of someone, just like what we are witnessing today. By far, the best way to get those simple stars is to repeat the slogans. Today, we can see how many times members stood up to say their slogans. That is because it is encouraged. They are told that they will get stars if they do that. There are Conservative members who are talking about how freedom within the caucus has become scarcer as a direct result of their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9"> leader</Affiliation>. If they want to talk about character assassination, I would like to share some thoughts about that with regarding the leader of the Conservative Party that Canadians should be aware of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753863">This multi-million dollar, self-serving game the Conservatives are playing today, and have been playing for the last six weeks on the floor of the House of Commons, has not only a substantive financial cost, but also a very negative impact on the legislative agenda. We would have seen legislation to protect children from online predators, legislation to protect sexually abused women and others within the Canadian forces by taking their cases out of military court and putting them into civilian courts and legislation to deal with Canada's supply lines. We could have talked about the fall economic statement, not to mention private members' bills, opposition day motions and all forms of legislation that could have been debated, but we are not. Why is that? It is because the Conservative leadership has made the decision to filibuster on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753864">We talk about character assassination, and we are witnessing the attack by the Conservatives toward the former minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. I would suggest that the one orchestrating it is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, who needs to look in the mirror. After all, he is the one in borderline contempt of Parliament with the multi-million dollar game he is orchestrating on the floor of the House of Commons. That is what is happening today. We are seeing a political game because the Conservative Party believes that they know better. They know better that unredacted documents should be given to the RCMP without any hesitation. That is what the leader of the Conservative Party believes, even though the RCMP and the Auditor General of Canada both say no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753865">The Conservatives are going to take into consideration, as a part of their filibuster, a serious issue of indigenous businesses and opportunities and use it to attack the character of a member of Parliament. However, I would suggest that we need to start reflecting more on the attitudes and the types of things the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is doing because it is purely self-serving and not in Canada's best interest. Here is a leader who is solely focused on preventing healthy debate in the chamber. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753866">My colleague posed a question earlier about the foreign interference issue. Again, it is rooted right back with the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. When the Conservatives criticize the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, members can listen to the complaints and the issues regarding the leader of the Conservative Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753869">Madam Speaker, if the member was around a bit more and listened to a lot of the discussions that have been taking place over the last number of weeks, he would know that it is absolutely relevant as the Conservatives are starting to use motions of this nature to attack the actions of members of Parliament. They are trying to say that this is not relevant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753870">After all, I am reflecting on the motivations and the character of the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>. They will be super sensitive if it is a Conservative who we are talking about, but Liberal members of Parliament are free game. That is their attitude. They try to prevent members from being able to express the reality of what is taking place in the chamber today. I say shame on the member for interrupting what is, in fact, an important statement that needs to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753871">Yes, the issue of indigenous businesses is of the utmost importance. In fact, over the weekend, we had a wonderful historical moment in the province of Manitoba. On Portage and Main, on the 20th floor of a building that is now owned by Red River Métis, David Chartrand and the Métis nation signed off on a treaty. We now have the Manitoba Métis national government on treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753872">Whether it is signing that important document just this past weekend, or literally the tens of millions of dollars that the Liberals have provided to encourage and support indigenous businesses, we have been there. However, we do not hear that being talked about because it does not fit the Conservatives' narrative. That is why it is important for people who follow the debates that take place in the House of Commons to not be fooled by what the Conservative Party does and has been doing for the last six weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753873">People should not think this is about concern over indigenous businesses. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a part of the game that the Conservatives are playing, and that game happens to be a filibuster to prevent the government from doing the business that would support indigenous Canadians, and all Canadians, in many different ways. They then use that to criticize and single out a particular member. I will continue pointing out the hypocrisy that is coming out of the office of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753874">As I was pointing out, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>, the deputy House leader of the government, made it very clear how another member of the House, which is being reported on in national news today, was interfered with through foreign interference. Why is that important to note? It is important because we are talking about the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and his unwillingness to get a security clearance. Members can think about that. He is the only leader in the House of Commons to do that. If someone wants to be an intern for the Conservative Party, they are required to get a security clearance, but not if someone is the leader of the Conservative Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753875">Today, through the news, we found out that there is a direct link to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> during his leadership campaign, which was interfered with through foreign interference. Do members remember, a year ago, how often we were hearing about the issue of foreign interference? The Conservatives were jumping all over each other to raise the issue, until we caught wind that there were maybe some Conservatives at play and it might not necessarily reflect well on them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753876">How the attitudes quickly changed. When is the last time we saw them stand up in question period and pose a question on foreign interference? I suspect it has a lot to do with the fact that the Conservative leader does not want to talk about the issue anymore because of something there that is preventing him from wanting to get the security clearance. The news story today is all about leadership interference. That might be one aspect of it, but I think there is more to it. I think there is more to why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> does not want to get the security clearance, and I believe Canadians have a right to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753877">If members across the way want to use this particular report to reflect on the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, while they stand up and they talk about that, what they should also be doing is reflecting, maybe looking in the mirror and thinking about the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. Should they not be applying the same sort of pressure, the same sort of tactics, maybe even within their own caucus, and call into question why their own leader refuses to get that security clearance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753878"> I believe foreign interference is one of those reasons that had a direct impact on his own leadership and one of the reasons why he might even be the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> today. I understand that Patrick Brown—</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Conservatives laugh. I do not think Patrick Brown was laughing. We have to summon him to committee in order to find the truth. I wonder maybe if we should be summoning him to the bar. That is something the Conservatives like to do. We will have to wait and find out just how open and honest they are with the answers coming from members on that particular committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753881"> I look forward to hearing some of the results. On the motion that we have, there is an amendment to call and demand that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> go before the committee. As Conservatives tell me all the time, we have unfettered rights here on the floor of the House of Commons. Even if it is a majority government, it does not matter because we have unfettered rights and they have to be respected no matter what, according to Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753882">I am wondering if the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> should actually be summoned to the very same committee that Patrick Brown is going to be. It would be interesting to hear her thoughts on foreign interference. One day she is supporting Patrick Brown, and then there is a conversation that takes place. Many would suggest that it qualifies as foreign interference. Then the next day, she is no longer supporting Patrick Brown. There is something there. Then a week passes by and she does not go back to supporting him. When I say supporting, I believe she was actually the co-campaign manager or something of that fact. We need to get to the bottom of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753883">Much like the motion that is being suggested here, I would suggest to all the committee members, as opposed to being instructed by the House of Commons, maybe they should be proactive and ask the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> to appear before the committee. That would be very helpful. I would encourage the member for Calgary Nose Hill to volunteer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753884"> When I read the story, she seemed to be offside with what the others were saying. Where have we heard that before? Is that not the same thing that is happening with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> and other allegations that are being made, where the member for Edmonton Centre does not agree with those allegations?</ParaText>

The current leader refuses to get that security clearance. Why? It is because he wants to be naive on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753888">It would be really good to see the two of them sitting there and being held accountable on foreign interference. I suspect that we are not going to get a motion to that effect coming from the Conservative Party, because, after all, transparency only matters when it is Conservatives attacking and using character assassination against Liberals. That is all that matters from the Conservative point of view. There is a responsibility of accountability for the Conservatives too. I will continue to push for that accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753889">On a final note, I encourage the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party to do the right thing and get the security clearance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753920">Madam Speaker, this will be an opportunity for me to talk about identity and, above all, cultural appropriation. I want to talk about identity as a collective commitment toward first nations in a context of reconciliation, evidently. I rise today to intervene on the 18th report, which was given to my colleagues by the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, on the matter of first nations, Red River Métis and Inuit identity theft. The committee shared it with my colleagues because this work should have been made a priority a long time ago. I am pleased to talk about it and to talk about the essential questions that need to be asked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753921">Identity is not just an abstract concept. It is an anchor. It ties us to our past, guides us in our present and lights the way to our future. It is not a right we can claim lightly, however. It is a promise that we make to our community, to our people and to those who will come after us. It is certainly not a privilege, as the federal government thinks it is, and, as I said, it is a fundamental right of a nation. What happens when that promise is broken? What happens when that identity is exploited, stolen or misused for personal or political gain? What happens when those who should be stewarding that identity, in other words, governments and institutions, fail to protect something that is sacred to so many communities? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753922">Today, I am asking my colleagues to reflect on what it means to protect an identity, not only our own, but also that of our people. More importantly, I am asking them to reflect on the real economic, cultural and political consequences of identity appropriation. We need to make this issue a priority. The work that the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs did was essential, urgent and necessary. This work is not only a political responsibility; it is a moral imperative. We are being called upon to answer a vital question that has been ignored for too long: How can we guarantee the integrity of identity recognition processes while respecting the legitimate rights of first nations, Métis and Inuit people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753923">Several ministers have already been asked to speak on this issue, as have some public servants whose decisions must now be examined in light of subsequent events. Experts will also be summoned to enlighten the committee regarding the loopholes that enabled such abuse to happen and suggest possible solutions. It is time to stop dancing around the issue. The misappropriation of indigenous identities is not just a simple administrative error or an isolated incident. It is an injustice that undermines our reconciliation efforts and the communities' trust in institutions. By failing to take immediate action, we have allowed unacceptable situations to proliferate. It is high time that we addressed this issue with courage and determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753924">We cannot disregard the recent events that have shaken the public's trust in our institutions. The matter involving the former minister and member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> is a perfect example of the dangers inherent to identity appropriation and its impact on relations between the government and indigenous peoples. Wrongfully claiming indigenous identity to obtain benefits or privileges, as alleged in this matter, is not only a serious breach of ethics, but a betrayal of the true members of these communities. This scandal highlights the urgent need to review our identity recognition procedures, ensure full transparency in government practices, and restore trust in our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753925">We have a duty to the first nations, Métis and Inuit to correct these injustices, to listen to their concerns and to protect their rights and their identity. The mistakes of the past must not be repeated, and the government must show leadership by implementing clear and fair mechanisms that will prevent this kind of abuse from happening again. People need an identity that uplifts them, not one that divides them. Identity is more than just a word or an idea. It is a history, a legacy and a duty. However, this history does not exist in isolation. It is intertwined with the history of the other peoples and communities who share our land and our values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753926">Take a recent example involving the Algonquins and Métis of Ontario. In 2017, the Ontario government gave harvesting rights to groups claiming to be Métis, without consulting the Algonquins, whose land was directly affected. The Government of Ontario even created an entity called Algonquins of Ontario, or AOO. The Ontario government uses it to avoid the real conversations it should be having with the Anishinabe on their land, the same unceded land we are on right now. Let us think about this: Algonquins, who have had a relationship with this land for thousands of years, are suddenly excluded from discussions about their own rights. This decision caused severe tension and undermined the trust between the indigenous communities and the institutions involved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753927">In 2023, the Ontario Court of Appeal sided with the Algonquins, the real ones, allowing them to sue the government. However, that victory came after years of struggle, frustration and loss that could have been avoided had the Algonquins been consulted from the start. This case illustrates the broader reality. Identities cannot be defined in the absence of recognition from the communities involved. Identities must be uplifting, not divisive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753928">There is a philosophy of recognition. Who we are is not a personal choice. It is not something we can adopt or advocate for because it seems beneficial or rewarding. It is based on a fundamental principle, and that is recognition. An identity must be recognized by those who truly carry it, by those who share its history and responsibilities. The Red River Métis, the Inuit, like the Algonquins, the Anishinabe and other first nations, have complex social and cultural networks, shared histories and governance systems that define who is part of their communities. They know better than anyone else who belongs to their communities. They know their members, their families, their alliances. When a person or a group claims an identity without being recognized by those communities, that poses a serious problem. It is not just about authenticity. It is also a matter of respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753929">Consider the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, a former federal cabinet minister. For years, he presented himself as Métis, claiming to be a non-status adopted Cree. His claims have been proven to be unfounded. This undermined his credibility and shattered public trust in our institution. This conduct by a minister raises ethical and moral questions. This type of claim harms more than just the person making the claim. It is far from being a personal mistake. It harms actual indigenous communities, which are being robbed of opportunities and resources, robbed of their stories and their legitimacy. Basically, stealing an identity is also stealing a voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753930">The real consequences of identity appropriation are not an abstract problem. They are real, measurable and often devastating for the communities involved. We are talking about the diversion of resources intended for indigenous communities. These include grants, programs and economic supports that, obviously, are limited. When individuals or groups falsely claim an identity, those resources are diverted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753931">Imagine a young Métis, Inuit or first nations artist whose project is rejected because some of the funding has been allocated to someone who does not actually belong to any of those communities. Imagine a family struggling to preserve its language or traditions but deprived of support because funds have been diverted to illegitimate projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753932">That reinforces stereotypes. When an identity is misappropriated, it is often oversimplified. That feeds stereotypes that keep indigenous communities trapped in simplistic roles, such as the spiritual indigenous person, the marginalized indigenous person or, worse, the invisible indigenous person. Such stereotypes do not support these communities, far from it. They reinforce inequality and discrimination and can even lead to cultural erasure. One of the most insidious risks of identity appropriation is cultural homogenization. When everything ends up looking the same, the unique characteristics of each culture are erased. Every language that is forgotten, every ritual that is abandoned and every story that is not passed down is a loss for humanity as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753933">Governments therefore have an implicit responsibility. All governments have a fundamental responsibility to protect the identities and rights of indigenous peoples. This responsibility cannot be taken lightly, because every decision a government makes or fails to make has profound impacts on social cohesion, justice and reconciliation. Governments must be vigilant, transparent and respectful to ensure that their decisions do not perpetuate past injustices. That requires clear, practical measures and systematic consultation. Every decision affecting indigenous rights or territories must be preceded by respectful, in-depth discussions with the nations affected. These consultations are not just an administrative exercise. They are an essential step for ensuring that the voices of first nations, Métis and Inuit people are at the heart of the decision-making process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753934">We need to establish clear criteria for recognition. Indigenous identities must be defined and recognized on the basis of solid historical evidence, authentic community ties and explicit validation by the nations concerned. Without such criteria, we risk diluting the integrity of indigenous identities and encouraging false claims.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753935">Greater protection of resources is also required. Governments must ensure that funds and opportunities for indigenous communities are actually directed to their true beneficiaries. This includes preventing abuse that diverts resources away from their original purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753936">When governments fail to fulfill these responsibilities, they fuel tensions, weaken legitimate claims and undermine reconciliation efforts. To do otherwise would not only betray the communities involved, but also undermine the public's trust in our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753937">It is imperative that governments rise to these challenges and act decisively to build a society where every identity is valued and respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753938">This leads us to reflect on our own identity. In Quebec, we have a long history of fighting to preserve our language, our culture and our rights. However, this fight must be fought with respect and humility. We cannot defend our identity while ignoring or downplaying the identity of others. The true strength of an identity, whether national or cultural, lies in its ability to coexist with others, to enrich and be enriched by different but complementary histories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753939"> The identity of the Quebec nation has never been frozen in time. It evolves with the times, it is enriched by discourse and reinvents itself in the face of modern-day challenges. Today, we live in a Quebec where cultural diversity, the claims of indigenous peoples and the struggle for social justice are redefining what it means to be a Quebecker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753940">The legacy of the Patriots, with their quest for freedom, equality and sovereignty, is still an inspiration. However, we need to go further. The contemporary question of Quebec's identity cannot be addressed without fully including the first nations and Inuit. Their history is intimately entwined with our own, and their contribution to our collective culture is immeasurable. We will never forget the Métis of the Red River colony and the first premier of Manitoba, Louis David Riel. Quebeckers supported him until his last breath and carried on the duty to keep alive the collective memory we share with the Métis of Red River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753941">In this increasingly globalized world, protecting our language, culture and history must include a sincere openness to others with whom we share this land. Today, being a Quebecker means accepting the duality of preserving what makes us different while valuing the diversity that enriches our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753942">We have a duty to build an identity that not only honours our past, but also reflects our collective aspirations. This identity includes, recognizes and celebrates the richness of its many components. It can help us carry the legacy of Quebec as a nation forward into today's world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753943">Ministerial responsibilities require courageous political action. To get back to the main topic, ministers play an essential role as political leaders in protecting identities, but also in correcting the mistakes of the past. This role extends beyond words and good intentions. It requires tangible, courageous action aimed at restoring equity and justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753944">Let us consider Bill <Document DbId="12540302" Type="3">C-53</Document>, for example. It is unacceptable as drafted and must be withdrawn. If we continue with this bill, we will be perpetuating injustice and further weakening the legitimate claims of indigenous communities. Rejecting this bill, as Métis and first nations people are calling for, is more than a symbolic gesture. It is an essential political act that will show that we will not tolerate identity misappropriation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753945">In addition, it is imperative to recognize that the 2023 agreement signed with the Métis Nation of Ontario, or MNO, was illegitimate. It was built on fragile and contested foundations and has already created considerable tension with first nations and genuine Métis communities. The federal government must send a clear message. Talks should be broken off immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753946">The Métis National Council was once a representative body but no longer exists as a functional organization. The Manitoba Métis withdrew from the council in 2021, and the Saskatchewan Métis followed their example in the spring of 2024. More recently, last Friday, the British Columbia Métis also left the council, and the situation in Alberta is already on the <Affiliation DbId="299998" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation>' desk. Clearly, the council has become dysfunctional and can no longer serve as a legitimate representative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753947">This farce has gone on long enough. The ministers need to show leadership by terminating these agreements and re-establishing transparent and respectful dialogue with the true representatives of the communities. Without a doubt, the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="299998" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278936" Type="4">Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency</Affiliation> have central roles to play in reconciliation efforts. However, they need to be aware that this responsibility does not rest solely on their shoulders. We have reminded them time and time again that some issues exceed the scope of their mandate and require the involvement of their cabinet colleagues.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753948">Reconciliation is not a task that can be compartmentalized. It requires a cross-cutting approach that spans across all departments and sectors. The Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs must ensure that justice and respect guide relations between law enforcement and indigenous communities. The Minister of Transport must take into account the realities of indigenous territories and work to open them up. The Minister of Canadian Heritage must recognize and support indigenous cultural initiatives to preserve and promote their languages, arts and stories. As for the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, he has a duty to integrate indigenous perspectives into the policies for welcoming new immigrants, ensuring that newcomers understand and respect the history and rights of first nations, Métis and Inuit peoples. The list goes on. Each minister must actively contribute, in his or her own area, to this reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753949">Reconciliation is not just an election promise or a budget line. It is a collective effort that requires coherence, collaboration and unwavering political will. Everyone must play their part, for it is only by acting together that we can build a future based on mutual respect and justice. These decisions are not just about correcting policies. They are about taking responsibility, taking the kind of action that shows we are serious about protecting indigenous identities and peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753950">In conclusion, it is time to build a shared and respected identity for the promise of a bright future. Today, we asked concerning and crucial questions for all indigenous nations. We looked at the challenges of identity protection and the injustices that are far too often ignored. We reiterated the responsibilities that governments, ministers and all of our institutions have to the first nations, Métis and Inuit. What we have done is reaffirm a promise not to avert our eyes, not to abandon legitimate voices and not to allow appropriation to continue to steal stories, resources and rights. Identity is a fundamental right, a right that is to be not only protected, but also respected and valued. That respect has to be at the heart of all of our actions because it is about our common future. I have invited the ministers to take courageous action on recognizing the identity of indigenous nations. We have the power to write a new page together, a page that honours the communities, respects the voices and gives each person the dignity they deserve. This work cannot wait any longer. It is time to act with determination and with an eye to upholding justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753951">I would add that this case speaks to the urgent need to create a registry recognized by first nations. As I said in my speech, first nations need to be able to determine who the members of their community are. When an individual, a minister or otherwise, claims indigenous status to gain access to contracts, that does nothing to further economic reconciliation. They say that 5% of the value of federal contracts is awarded to first nations businesses. However, if that money is constantly being misappropriated by people who check a box on a form to gain access to those funds because, in their opinion, they deserve because they identify as indigenous, we have a real societal issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753952">I would remind the House that the fundamental issue is reconciliation. In this context, economic reconciliation necessarily involves respecting the power of first nations to define who they are. I have some examples. I mentioned an entity known as the Algonquins of Ontario, which has endorsed projects like Chalk River. The Indigenous, Algonquin and Anishinabe people living around Chalk River unanimously oppose the project, however, along with 140 municipalities. The fact is that certain pretendians not recognized by indigenous peoples have said that they support this economic bill. We do not know what agreements were made. We do not even know who they are. They are just people who checked a box on a form saying they are indigenous. They appropriated an identity, and that is causing real problems in today's society, because first nations are having to go all the way to the Supreme Court to assert their rights. This has to stop.</ParaText>

In fact I highlighted a very special event that took place in downtown Winnipeg, at Portage and Main, just this past weekend: The Red River Métis Self-Government Recognition and Implementation Treaty was signed off. It is the first time a Métis government is actually being recognized through a treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753954"> David Chartrand and his government have done a great favour to our entire nation by continuously advocating, for many, many years, for the treaty. It pleases me that as a Government of Canada, after close to 150 years, we have achieved that. If we were to check with David Chartrand or any cabinet member, we would find clear, unanimous support that it is the Métis who define who the Métis are. I am wondering whether the member could provide his thoughts on the issue.</ParaText>

There is a difference between cultural appropriation, which we must speak out against as we are today, and cultural appreciation. When I went to Wendake, I visited Bastien Industries. Their owner, Jason, gave me a great lesson in this. We can appreciate elements that are indigenous as long as they are truly indigenous, but Jason raised a major issue. If he wants to sell his moccasins in the U.S., he has to provide his Indian status card. If he wants to sell his moccasins in Canada, they do not even ask for it. This means that anyone can sell moccasins, the Hudson's Bays of this world, without them actually being made by indigenous people. It is a major issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753973"> Madam Speaker, today I rise to speak to a critical topic related not just to this place but also to indigenous people right across the country. I want to mention the fact that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278288" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>, who is very honourable. She is not only a champion for indigenous rights in this place but also a champion for indigenous people right across our planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753974">We are prepared to discuss a topic presented to the indigenous and northern affairs committee related to the member for<Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2"> Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. The member for Edmonton Centre had falsely identified himself as indigenous, or at least misled individuals, in particular the Liberal Party of Canada, into believing this. For what purpose would one do this? Why would someone go through the process of undertaking identity fraud, identity theft, and taking from a people what is truly theirs and more? Actually, when I mentioned this story to my sister, she said something really interesting. She said, “Oh, great, someone wants to identify as indigenous. That is fantastic. They should also face the consequences we do.” Wow, members can imagine how my sister, a visible woman of colour, was not able to overcome the serious barriers that were present to her as a young person when trying to enter into business or jobs, when trying to enter into a workplace where she was seen as a whole person. The contrast that we are seeing today has been extraordinarily exerted in the past few years. Buffy Sainte-Marie is an example of what is a really real and unfortunate circumstance facing Canadians. This example was a wake-up call to Canadians, to each and every one of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753975">This kind of pervasive fraud is often not prosecuted, not investigated. This raises the question of why a person does it, as well as why we do not investigate it. Canada had 1,100 companies that were just deregistered; they have been delisted from the federal indigenous procurement registry, something that was mentioned by the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">indigenous services minister</Affiliation> a few weeks ago. Wow, 1,100 companies were pre-approved as indigenous for the purpose of procurement in the Government of Canada's indigenous procurement strategy. It is shameful that we were unable to designate and delist those companies beforehand. This policy has been in place since the nineties. My God, what a failure it is of both Conservative and Liberal governments that they had no care or concern about this issue for as long as this policy has been in existence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753976">Worse yet, the Conservatives now cry wolf as if they were big stalwarts or big champions of indigenous rights, indigenous identity, when they were the government in charge at the time this program had been operating. The Liberals inherited this problem, and they kept it. It is a matter of convenience, a marriage of convenience perhaps. This has played out in Canada's history for the better part of 157 years, often to the detriment of indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753977">There are consequences to this kind of misbehaviour, these kinds of crimes. We have seen in Nunavut, for example, a sentence of three years in prison in a case where two young people had taken indigenous identity, Inuit identity, for the purposes of educational funding. It is shameful. Now we see, in this great, august chamber, individuals who are unable to tell us who they truly are; they stand very proudly and profess who they are, without any ability to understand that there are qualifiers to understanding that. There are frameworks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753978">There are actually even court cases in Canada that indigenous people had to overcome to even see their own people identified and recognized. Regina v. Van der Peet, for example, is a first nations Supreme Court case that delineated who was first nations for the purpose of commercial rights. Indigenous Métis people have had to, still today, since 2003, in the Powley case, decide who is indigenous. In those cases, the court was deciding. How shameful is it that the government was so unable to create a nation-to-nation, government-to-government relationship with those it literally legislated for when it was part of their benefit? At the time of the Indian Act, for example, the government knew who was indigenous. It knew who was indigenous for the purposes of residential school or the sixties scoop. It knew who was indigenous when it came to paying out treaty breaches, massive breaches in the agreements made by our ancestors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8753979">Government members knew who was indigenous then, but now, when they happen to be sitting in cabinet, all of a sudden, they do not. Holy smokes, they could not even ask the guy. They are going to put him in their indigenous caucus. They are going to label it as an indigenous caucus, and they will call it the “fantastic eleven”. Today, we have questions about those individuals. We have questions about those who pose as indigenous for prestige, reputation or access to funding. The reason this is an important investigation to undertake is that the pain is felt deeply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753980">I am sure some would argue, particularly the Liberals, that the real victim here is the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. However, the real victims are indigenous people, indigenous businesses and indigenous communities. They have done the hard work of organizing their community, creating a benefit-impact study, talking to the community members, understanding what they can do as a community and creating employment, only to be met with a rigged system in Ottawa created by Liberals and Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753981">The Liberals and Conservatives like to talk a big game about how they are very different parties, but they have always benefited from being on the same side of the coin. When one does something bad, the other one is elected and then does the bad thing again. Always, over and over, this tradition exists in Canada. There are rights. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8753984">Now, with goodness and decency, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278298" Type="2">Winnipeg South</Affiliation> is telling them, “We are going to lose on this, so we had better not talk about it.” I appreciate that because it is true. The Liberals have no clue how to engage indigenous people, unless a court is telling them how to do it. That is a true fact. I beg my Liberal colleagues to look at that. Every single agreement comes through the narrow lens of the law. The government would rather debate who has rights in a matter of law, in a court of law, than to acknowledge that indigenous people are truly people who need recognition and rights in this place. That is the real shame of all this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753985">I have spoken to the government many times about this pervasive issue. The <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="299998" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation> admit that Canada's system is like this. They have to go to the courts, and then we will come to them; that is just the process. We have to prove to them that we have rights. No. I say Canada needs to prove to me that it has rights. It needs to prove to indigenous people why it thinks its laws are superficial to the indigenous natural law that exists in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753986">This is how far away we have come from the true necessary pieces of this discussion. We fail to see a nation-to-nation relationship when we always come at it from this domestic point of view, in which these nations lack the quality of sovereignty. They lack the quality of nationhood and of being able to assert self-determination for themselves. This kind of paternalism is sick, and it is over. This, today, is a warning. This discussion is a warning to pretendians everywhere. If they attempt to steal indigenous people's identity for the purpose of reputation or funding, we will find them. We will take from them everything they have sought to take from indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753987">I say to indigenous people, who have suffered from these very obvious and long-standing cases of discrimination, that a better future is possible. A better future is near us. We have young people who are engaged in these systems right now; they are innovating, learning their language, coming back to the land and doing the hard work of reconnecting with who they really are. That is a blessing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8753988">We have a great blessing just ahead of us. It is the generation to come right after me. Those young indigenous people are fierce. They are warriors; they are strong. I am so deeply proud of them. I cannot wait until they fill this chamber with their voices, with their stories, and bring true justice and true accountability to this country. We need to see that future. The future is promising. The future is with our indigenous youth; it will be one where who we are, our dignity and our stories are truly met. This beautiful planet will then have an opportunity to share with all of us the opportunities that I hope indigenous people will make present for everyone.</ParaText>

As I was saying, it is super disappointing to see that the Liberal government, which said the nation-to-nation relationship was the most important priority, has not solved the boil water advisories. We see very little progress on the truth and reconciliation recommendations the Stephen Harper government recommended. We see hardly any action on murdered and missing aboriginal women.

              <ParaText id="8754001">Madam Speaker, I am disappointed. I am disappointed by consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments that always use indigenous people as a gambling chip. Whether it is Conservatives today using indigenous people as a gambling chip to “own the libs” or the Liberals consistently neglecting their responsibility for indigenous people, both are immense travesties in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754002">When it comes to clean water, which the member mentioned, I want to correct the record on the history of clean water. The reason we are debating clean water legislation today is that the Conservative government of the past litigated in court and it was deemed inappropriate. It was deemed illegal. The Conservatives were attempting to take control over indigenous people's water and the court said no way. Now the Liberals are coming with another inferior piece of legislation that is almost identical to the Conservatives' piece of legislation. That is the problem that exists when it comes to clean water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754003">When it comes to truth and reconciliation, we witnessed the largest indigenous protest in Canada's history, called Idle No More, to kick Stephen Harper to the curb. Indigenous people did that. We stood on our rights. We stood on the shoulders of giants who led the way, our ancestors in particular. That will never allow us to see dignity or pride ever again.</ParaText>

The sad part about people like him, like Buffy Sainte-Marie, like the many academics who have received scholarships, grants and bursaries using our identity to get millions of dollars in research grants, is that they financially benefit, but they do not have to deal with the kinds of things that we do as indigenous people. We have to deal with the intergenerational impacts of residential school. We have an ongoing genocide against indigenous women and girls so severe in the Winnipeg that I fear for the safety of my nieces taking taxi cabs there.

              <ParaText id="8754044">I will try to be brief. What bothers me today is that all these false indigenous identity claims are being used to obtain funds that could be going toward reconciliation efforts and nation-to-nation dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754045">As my colleague knows, study after study at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women confirms the need for programs to support indigenous communities, particularly to help indigenous women who are disproportionately affected by resource development in western Canada. My colleague is well aware of this, because she was the one who proposed this study to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. We also need red dress alert programs. Funding is also needed to promote the economic empowerment of indigenous women and girls and to implement the recommendations of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754049">I am going to spend a little time talking about why I think we are debating this today. It is important, just to bring everybody back to the same place, to read exactly what we are debating. This is a concurrence motion, a motion that came from the committee and that the Conservatives have tabled today. The motion reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754050">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the committee report to the House that the MP for Edmonton Centre appear before the committee for two hours independently by Friday, December 6, 2024, immediately following the completion and reporting back of C-61 to the House, and that the report is tabled by the Chair in the House as soon as possible and no later than Monday, November 25, 2024.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754051"> The Conservatives then further amended this to say that it would return from committee by January 27.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754052">That is what we are debating. That is what three hours of House time has been seized with, to debate whether or not the former minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, should go and appear before committee on this particular day for this allotted amount of time and have it be reported back to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754053">That is what the Conservatives chose to do. The reason I bring this up is that, like so many times throughout this fall session when we have debated these issues, specifically these procedural tactics, Conservatives are doing this time and time again. I find it very discouraging, because there are so many other things that we could be talking about and so many other issues that we could be discussing. Instead, we revert back to the Conservative go-to of character assassination and trying to drag people through the mud. That is the only way this Conservative Party feels as though it can ever get elected, not to present its ideas to Canadians but rather to, repeatedly and ad nauseam, try to create and inflict maximum personal damage on individual reputations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754054"> It does not even have to be an elected official. The Conservatives will stop at nothing. They will go after renowned Canadians, as we saw last spring. They will go after just about anybody that they think they can get a little political gain out of. That is what we are seeing today, again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754055">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, who was a minister, stepped back. He defended himself and said that the allegations against him were not true. He stepped back and said that he wanted to clear his name, wanted to take time to do that and would step back from the ministry in the meantime. That is exactly what he did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754056">However, it was not enough. It is an honourable way to approach this, but that was not enough for Conservatives. They need to absolutely go after this until they have drawn as much blood out of this situation as possible. I find it so discouraging, and I believe that the majority of Canadians do too. We have to ask ourselves, “What do they not want to be talking about?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754057">Some fairly substantial bombshell allegations have been dropped recently. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> is being implicated in a recent CBC story about having been pressured by foreign diplomats to abandon Patrick Brown's leadership campaign in a leadership race that eventually elected the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> to that position. Here is something even more remarkable. Not that long ago, the member for Calgary Nose Hill was in a committee room, she was approached by the media and she jumped up and ran out. There is a video of it all over the Internet right now. She jumped up and ran out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754058"> By the way, this is the member who, not too long ago, referred to herself, and I have to find it here in the story, as a seasoned politician and a seasoned communicator. That is what she said. Those were her words. However, she could not handle the heat of the media coming up to her in a committee room. She got up and she ran out of the committee room. When I see something like that, the first thing I think of is that somebody is trying to hide something.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754059"> The member made some comments that are in the story. She said she left the Patrick Brown campaign of her “own volition”; she was not pressured. She is “an experienced politician, [a] seasoned communicator”, and she knows how to handle herself. She certainly does, because she handled herself very well in that comment alone. She skated right by the main issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754060">The issue is not whether or not the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> changed her mind as a result of a conversation. The issue is not even, believe it or not, whether or not she was coerced by a foreign diplomat. That is not the issue either.

                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that correction: a former minister. We cannot even seem to get members of the House who potentially have information to go before committee. My point is, as it relates to this report, that there is this double standard that Conservatives seem to be placing. On the one hand, they are saying we absolutely need to get this minister appearing before committee. That is what this whole report is about. I apologize to my colleague from the Conservatives if she feels I am not staying on topic. This is literally just two sentences that we are debating. That is what this is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754080">We are debating whether the minister should be dragged before committee.

              <ParaText id="8754081">I end with where I started: I believe this is nothing more than an attempt by Conservatives to drag people who have already stated their position and admitted they are going to remove themselves from the position they are in, in order to clear their name.

              <ParaText id="8754098">Mr. Speaker, I want first to recognize that we are gathered on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754099">I would like to acknowledge the valuable work the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs has carried out by examining the infrastructure deficit confronting many indigenous communities. The report prepared by the committee, titled “A Path to Growth: Investing in the North”, provides important insights into the challenges facing infrastructure development and maintenance in the north and helpfully recommends potential solutions for them. The report will help to inform policy and program decisions going forward. Common themes from the report are core to how we are proactively addressing challenges in partnership with indigenous peoples. Following their lead, we are working to remove systemic barriers to economic development and to advance indigenous economic self-determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754100"> However, before outlining some of the many ways we are making progress, I must respond to misleading statements being made in today's debate and set the record straight. As members of government have repeatedly made clear, Global Health Imports was never listed on the indigenous business directory. Consequently, the company has not ever been part of the government's procurement program for indigenous businesses, nor was it awarded any contracts through the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754101"> Instead, I want to bring the focus back to tangible activities that are producing real results in the lives and for the livelihoods of indigenous peoples. Together with indigenous leaders, indigenous business and the broader sector, we are working to advance economic reconciliation. On this note, this past year Indigenous Services Canada convened two economic reconciliation round tables, which were attended by leaders from national indigenous organizations and national indigenous economic institutions, senior executives from Canada's financial sector, federal ministers, and senior federal officials. Indigenous peoples are leading the way to advance economic reconciliation, and what this level of engagement at the round tables demonstrates is that economic reconciliation is not a conversation limited to government. There are also commitments and buy-in from the financial sector to advance common goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754102">By supporting self-determined economic priorities and collaborating with leading economic thinkers across Canada, we will continue to drive toward concrete actions and concrete solutions that will make a difference in the everyday lives of first nations, Inuit and Métis people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754103">The round tables have advanced a common understanding of how public and private sector actions can help to remove access to capital barriers. Participants brought forward ideas for how greater access to risk capital could help to finance infrastructure gaps, while also exploring ways the financial sector can continue to adapt and develop expertise to best serve indigenous communities in navigating complex land and financing questions. It is clear that relevant and topical data on indigenous economies is essential to supporting community-level investment decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754104"> We are looking at opportunities for collaboration between indigenous institutions and financial and statistical experts to address data gaps through the publishing of indigenous economic outlooks. Partners are challenging us to reimagine how to develop these outlooks with opportunities to blend traditional economic indicators with qualitative data and narrative storytelling. A common theme across these conversations is the leading roles indigenous peoples must play in defining the challenges and solutions that will support their economic priorities. There are many opportunities to support exciting indigenous visions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754105"> This is not the only way we are advancing economic reconciliation. Various economic development programs have been designed to support improved economic outcomes. For example, the aboriginal entrepreneurship program, the AEP, provides access to capital and access to business opportunities to indigenous entrepreneurs and business owners in Canada. This program seeks to increase the number of viable businesses in Canada that are owned and controlled by indigenous people, and it funds a broad range of entrepreneurial pursuits. It also aims to build capacity, reduce barriers and increase access to capital by forging partnerships that will increase economic opportunities for first nations, Inuit and Métis people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8754106">Over the past 35 years, the program has distributed roughly 52,000 business loans worth $3.2 billion through its access to capital stream. These loans, I might add, have a repayment rate of over 95%. Consider that for every $1 million lent by indigenous financial institutions through the access to capital stream, $3.6 million is produced in total gross domestic product for Canada. That is an impressive return on investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754107">Most beneficial is that an evaluation of the indigenous entrepreneurship and business development program over the period 2015-16 to 2020-21 found it is advancing indigenous self-determination by removing barriers to business capital and supports. Equally important is that it is sustaining the network of indigenous lending institutions, creating and expanding indigenous businesses and creating or maintaining jobs through lending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754108">That is not the only example of economic reconciliation in action. The aboriginal entrepreneurship program, which I just talked about, is actually led by and delivered through the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association, or NACCA, and the Métis capital corporations. It is highly significant that a program put in place to enable first nations, Inuit and Métis business owners to launch or grow their businesses is also led by strong indigenous leaders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754109">The National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association and the Métis capital corporations administer about $25 million per year of equity capital, provided by the Government of Canada, to enable indigenous entrepreneurs to obtain affordable commercial loans. This indigenous-led program shows what success looks like when indigenous peoples are supported and empowered to independently deliver services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754110">The aboriginal entrepreneurship program also supports the $150-million indigenous growth fund. This indigenous-led and -designed fund is providing indigenous businesses with a fully independent source of capital. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754111">The procurement strategy for indigenous businesses I mentioned earlier is another initiative producing positive economic results for indigenous people. It facilitates access to federal procurement opportunities so that indigenous businesses can win contracts, generate revenue and gain experience that, in turn, can assist them in winning larger future contracts within both the public and private sectors. What we have heard from indigenous leaders is that they want the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses to stay. It continues to evolve and adapt to changing needs and fiscal realities, in large part because we are listening to indigenous leaders and businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754112">The resulting feedback from procurement round tables held with indigenous leaders since 2018 led directly to improvements to the strategy, which is why our relationships with indigenous partners are so important. Our programs, policies and services must apply indigenous insights, lessons learned and expertise, and that is exactly what we are doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754113">These efforts have accelerated since 2021, when we began to co-develop a transformative indigenous procurement strategy with indigenous partners. The five-year process is currently under way, and these reforms will improve existing indigenous procurement policies and programs. Furthermore, they will help ensure benefits intended for indigenous peoples go to indigenous peoples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754114">An important part of this collaborative work includes determining a path forward to transferring the administration of the indigenous business directory to indigenous partners. One key message delivered by partners in our co-development discussions is that first nations, Inuit and Métis are best positioned to define and verify indigenous businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754115">Indigenous Services Canada is committed to working with partners, including the Assembly of First Nations, the Métis National Council, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association and the Canadian Council for Indigenous Business to transfer the verification of indigenous businesses to indigenous partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754116">We know economic opportunities for indigenous businesses were removed or blocked through years of colonial policies and practices. The concrete actions taken by the Government of Canada, in co-operation and partnership with indigenous leaders and businesses, must continue. We need the valuable insights and expertise of first nations, Métis and Inuit leaders. We need continued opportunities for meaningful dialogue, and we need reports like “A Path to Growth: Investing in the North” that shine a light on the work ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754117">It is economic reconciliation in action when we collaborate on efforts to support and empower indigenous people to fully and equitably participate, whether as small business owners or leaders of major projects in the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754132"> Among the serious matters that the member must answer for and be held accountable for is the fact that his shady, pandemic-profiteering PPE company falsely held itself out to be a wholly owned indigenous company when it applied for two federal government contracts. It was a blatant attempt to give the company's bids a leg-up in the government's procurement selection process. In other words, it was an attempt to steal government contracts from legitimately owned indigenous businesses. It is about as low as it gets. It is cultural appropriation in one of its most offensive forms. Do members know what else it is? It is outright fraud. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754141"> It is tough to keep track, given all the representations over the years that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> has made about his indigenous status, which he, in fact, does not have. I also have to observe that I have listened to the member make those representations. I can remember when he sat over there between 2015 and 2019. I heard him make those types of representations enough times that I simply assumed he had indigenous ancestry of some sort as one aspect of his background. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754142">For the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">member</Affiliation> to say now that he had no idea does not bear any credibility. I would submit that it is part of a pattern. This is a member who constantly says, very conveniently, that he has no idea. He had no idea that his company falsely represented itself to be indigenous owned, just as he had no idea that his company was connected to a cocaine trafficker. He had no idea about the text messages from Randy to his business partner, who was implicated in a half-a-million dollar fraud, or the arson at the company's warehouse. On and on it goes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754143"> The minister's contention that he had no idea about the fact that his company tried to steal government contracts from legitimately owned indigenous businesses has zero credibility. Further, I would observe that the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation>, at the time these bids and these false representations were made, was not just anyone at the company; he was one of two partners, and he was involved in the operations of the company on a day-to-day basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754144"> This was, after all, before the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">member</Affiliation> returned and was appointed to cabinet after the 2021 election. As I noted, it seems very likely that, notwithstanding that he ought not to have been, the member continued to be involved in the operations of the business, including potentially involving himself in matters of fraud while he sat in cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754145">It is imperative that the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> come before committee to answer questions. The day he resigned from cabinet happened to be the very day he was scheduled to appear before the ethics committee. I have to say I find it highly suspicious that the member resigned from cabinet on that day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754146"> The <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">member</Affiliation> has been less than transparent when he has come before committee. When he first appeared before committee, when there were allegations surrounding these text messages of a Randy, he claimed, and he had the committee believe, that he had nothing to do with the company, nothing to do with the operations and nothing to do with communicating with Anderson. This was until further text messages revealed that this Randy was in Vancouver at the very same time the former minister was in Vancouver. He then came back to committee and said, “Oh, actually, I did talk to my business partner, Anderson. Oops, I forgot to mention it.” This was not just an omission. It was a material omission that amounted to misleading the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754147">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> better not hide behind the fact that he is not in cabinet because right now he is in hiding. No one has heard or seen from the member since he resigned from cabinet. He needs to come out of hiding. He needs to come to committee, and he must answer for his conduct involving this sordid and fraudulent matter.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8754154">Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> if he would join Conservatives in axing the federal GST on housing so more Canadians could finally buy a home. Axing the federal GST would spark 30,000 new developments across the country per year. This tax cut would save $40,000, or $2,200 a year in mortgage payments on an $800,000 house. Unfortunately, the Minister of Housing refuses to remove this burden from Canadians' shoulders and still clings to a housing accelerator fund that does not build homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754155">The NDP-Liberal housing accelerator fund has failed Canadians. Toronto received $471 million and it increased development cost charges by more than $20,000; Ottawa received $176.3 million and it increased development charges by between 11% and 12%; and my hometown of Abbotsford received $25.6 million and it increased development charges by 54%. Indeed, even in the letter Abbotsford sent to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> after he requested a supportive letter from it, my own municipality could not tell the minister how many homes have in fact been built with the housing accelerator money it has received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754156"> It is unfortunate that the government promised to lower rents, mortgages and housing prices, but has instead doubled these costs for Canadians. Before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took power, it took 25 years to pay off a mortgage. Now it takes 25 years just to save up for a down payment. Things have gotten so bad that some families believe they will never be able to pay off their mortgage, let alone get one. Only in Canada has housing become so unaffordable so quickly. Home prices are expected to once again break the records they set just recently. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754157">Between 25,000 and 35,000 people are homeless on any given night in Canada; 30% of Canadians who are homeless come from indigenous communities; and 22% of shelters are aimed at young homeless in Canada, while 20% of people experiencing homelessness are between the ages of 13 and 24 years of age. Also, 88% of renters say their goal of owning a home is out of reach, so much so that 28% of Canadians are considering moving to another country for greater affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754158"> Back in October 2015, a month before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office, it only took 39% of the median pre-tax household income to cover home ownership costs; now it is about 60%. Although it used to be normal for working-class youth to buy homes, 80% of Canadians now tell pollsters that home ownership is only for the very rich. Removing the GST on new homes under $1 million would not only spark new developments across Canada; it would also remove a tax burden for new homeowners in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8754159"> Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member. He is a good member, and I know he cares a great deal about his community. He talks about families in his community and across the country. What he does not mention is that the Conservatives would, right away, if they were to assume office, cut child care support, which has now moved in many parts of the country to $10 a day. Where it is not at $10, it will soon be, which will make life much more affordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754160">The Conservatives would get rid of the school food program, which we have seen tremendous progress on. Recently, the provincial government in Ontario came together with the federal government. Manitoba and Prince Edward Island are also moving forward. What about support to help people living with diabetes? The Conservatives would get rid of free insulin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754161">To the point at hand, the Conservatives would also get rid of support for housing. The member talks about the so-called big, bold idea the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has put forward to lift GST off the purchase price of a home. How would they pay for that? They would do so by getting rid of the housing accelerator fund, which unfortunately my friend has not characterized correctly here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754162">I do not discount at all the importance of development charges; they are an impediment to getting more homes built, and municipalities have to find a way to lower them as much as possible. However, what the member does not talk about is the systemic changes that come as a result of the federal government's attaching conditions to federal funding for municipalities, so that, for example, zoning changes can become possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754163">Throughout too much of Canada's history, certainly into the modern day, the building of certain types of homes has been outright illegal in this country. In some neighbourhoods, it has been outright illegal to build duplexes or triplexes or fourplexes, or row houses or mid-rise apartments. All of those would add tremendously to affordability to help the families in the member's community. I especially have on my mind the young couples, for example, who have a tough time, if they can put together a down payment, finding a home that is affordable for them. They cannot do it right now in so many instances. Zoning changes would allow for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754164">What the federal government has done is said that we recognize that restrictive zoning is a huge impediment to getting more homes built, and we have attached conditions onto municipalities that if they want federal dollars for housing and infrastructure, they agree to make zoning changes. Many are doing so. At this point, there have been 178 agreements, and the number will grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754165">Finally, the member also fails to mention that the GST proposal of the Conservatives would lead to the cancellation of the government's infrastructure support for communities. We cannot have housing unless we have infrastructure, for example to connect water systems and roads to homes, and to make neighbourhoods possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754166">We have said there is a need for infrastructure, and we have attached a condition for it too: that development charges be frozen to April 2024 levels to ensure that development charges in that issue are in the first instance dealt with, but also to ensure that municipalities are doing what they need to do to build more homes. This is why the condition exists, and the Conservatives want to get rid of it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754167">Mr. Speaker, I think the member for <Affiliation DbId="278607" Type="2">London North Centre</Affiliation> and I can agree on one thing: Zoning reform is indeed needed across Canada. It was under the previous election platform from the Conservative Party that zoning measures were introduced as a means to spur more development. The Liberals in fact copied our plan. The premier of British Columbia implemented similar policies and actually targeted my community of Abbotsford to put in those very zoning changes to encourage building of fourplexes etc. In fact my street is now zoned for fourplexes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754168">I will note that the member mentioned $10-a-day day care. There is only one place in Abbotsford where people can get it, and that is on Eagle Mountain at the new elementary school. It is the area of the highest income of the entire community, so what the Liberals have done is given the people with the most money more support under the program. It is a shame.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754169"> Mr. Speaker, we will agree to disagree on that point; $10 a day child care is moving forward in communities across the country. As I said, where it is not available, it will be available in communities throughout the land, and that is critical to our country's economic success and to our shared future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754170">On the point at hand, again, the accelerator fund, the proposal by the member's party would get rid of the program, which would be a detriment to communities in his riding. The Lytton First Nation is counting on the fund for 176 new homes. The Boston Bar First Nation is counting on 65 new homes as a result of the program. Finally, the Seabird Island Band is counting on the accelerator fund for 251 new homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754171">I am not sure what the official opposition has against the federal government's working with municipalities and with indigenous communities to get more homes built and attaching conditions to ensure that more homes get built. We are doing that and we will continue to do it. The Conservatives are standing in the way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754172">Mr. Speaker, in my question for the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> on November 22, last month, I can only think that the minister's reply was not only to ignore the question but to deflect from accountability for his failures with a personal attack on me and my staff that was as pathetic as it was transparent. Let us be honest. We all know that someone resorts to personal attacks when they cannot defend a position based on its merits, and there is no defending the minister's complete and utter incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754173">To set the record straight, while I have gotten used to the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s insults, I will not tolerate outright misrepresentations made against me or my staff, especially when I have evidence that categorically proves that my staff and I have made several representations to the minister to assist my constituents and their families.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8754174"> For the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to state that I have “never brought a single case to [him]” is an outright mistruth. If the minister had any credibility, he would do the honourable thing and withdraw his offending and inaccurate comments. Perhaps he should check with his own departmental staff to see the cases that we have brought to the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754175"> I also want to correct the minister as to why I am no longer sitting in my former seat. It had nothing to do with my not wishing to sit near the <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Green Party leader</Affiliation>; I had done so for nearly two years. I moved simply because, due to the addition of a new independent member, I would be sitting next to an MP whom I personally feel does not share the same interests that I have for a democratic Canada. The <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> would do well to review why certain members of his party's caucus no longer find themselves within it, and he may actually learn something from the exercise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754176">It was unconscionable for the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to suggest that I only asked my question of his useless administration of the immigration department for my benefit. It was out of utter frustration for individuals who are trying to make Canada their home but who are suffering from delays and from the inability to receive any answers as to why they are waiting years to have their cases actioned. I have raised with the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> cases of doctors and skilled tradespeople, individuals who would contribute to building a better Canada for all Canadians but who find themselves languishing in an immigration quagmire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754177">Under the minister's direction, the morass that is IRCC seems better suited to letting the IRGC and other terrorists blatantly use and abuse our immigration and refugee systems in order to remain in Canada, rather than to help other people who would become contributing and law-abiding citizens. What an utter disgrace, and it gets even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754178"> Due to the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s incompetence, Canada is now facing heavy tariffs being laid on Canadian exports to the United States by the incoming Trump administration. Instead of bringing doctors to heal Canadians, the government issues new passports to admitted human traffickers. Instead of prioritizing tradespeople who would build the homes we need, the immigration minister abuses his power and uses a ministerial intervention, not for a life-or-death situation but to save a five-time criminally convicted foreign national who boasted of foreign financing to blockade Canadian roads, highways and pipelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754179">It is high time for the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to be dismissed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before further damage is done to Canada and to those who not only want to make our country their home, but want to help heal Canadians and build the homes we need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754180">Therefore, would the parliamentary secretary not agree that the first step to fixing a problem is to acknowledge that we have one, and that at the core of it is an incompetent minister with twisted priorities?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754181">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise in the House and answer my colleague's questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754182">We heard my colleague make personal attacks against a minister he disagrees with about the immigration system, but he also tried to stoke Canadians' fears over immigration. However, I want to say how important it is to our government and to the department that these matters be discussed at length and publicly. We cannot talk about specific cases, but I can speak to our general immigration guidelines. Every application is unique. Every applicant can apply for programs, but spaces are limited. It can take longer to enter the system if information is missing from an application or if applicants do not answer questions promptly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754183">My colleague mentioned doctors. He also mentioned skilled workers, who are part of our society. My riding of Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation is no exception. We have doctors who are there to support the community, who are willing to stay in remote communities. However, it is because of the immigration system that communities like ours in Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation can have good doctors. It is the same for agricultural workers. Farm workers depend on our culture. They depend on every type of product that reaches our plates. There are vineyards that benefit from immigration. Berry farmers benefit. It is also good for tourism development. For example, at Château Montebello in Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation, foreign workers enable the hotel to offer world-class service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8754184">We see that there is high demand to immigrate to Canada. Many applications are submitted every year. People want to benefit from the good quality of life that we have in Canada. The department is meeting its target of processing 80% of the applications, including in a certain number of important programs: citizenship, highly skilled workers in areas of federal jurisdiction, provincial candidates, family reunification for spouses and children. I am thinking about Tony, my barber, who is working on reuniting his family. They are in a wartorn country. We have an immigration system in place. We intend to modernize it, make it more accessible and easier, while taking into account the lack of housing in Canada. We have to reduce the level of immigration, but we have to do it the right way. We are also digitizing several programs to reduce the bureaucracy. We are improving services for clients and Canadians and aligning objectives for 2025 to 2027. I do have a message for my colleague, however: he needs to stop scaring Canadians.</ParaText>

If he was Minister of Immigration, would he be doing exactly what his <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is doing now, which is nothing, or would he be taking real action to protect Canadians, secure our border and protect our livelihoods so we are not taxed to oblivion by the incoming Trump administration?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8754187">Mr. Speaker, I have full confidence in our <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation>. The minister is working to protect national security. He is working with the Prime Minister's Office and with the best experts in Canada. The Minister of Immigration is supported by various services to keep Canadians as safe as possible. We have strengthened our borders. We have invested in technology. We have also increased the number of officers at the border. Why have we done this? We did it to be better. As soon as new immigrants arrive in Canada, they go through a variety of services to ensure that they are safe in Canada and that Canadians are safe when we welcome these immigrants.</ParaText>
