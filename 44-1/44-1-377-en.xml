For far too long, the Palestinian people have suffered being stateless. Canada has long supported a two-state solution. Canada took the first step toward diplomatic relations 30 years ago. Canada has a representative office in Ramallah; Palestine has a representative office in Ottawa. Time is past due to take the next step, to stand up for what is right. We must end this misery, preserve human rights and recognize the state of Palestine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8734962"> Mr. Speaker, today, I am wearing pink to honour the life and legacy of a remarkable young girl, Bella Thomson, better known around the world as Bella Brave. Bella had a big personality and an even bigger TikTok following of seven million people; she would brighten people's day with videos of her dancing, singing and short music video collabs with her mom and even the Calgary Flames.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8734963"> Bella had to overcome many obstacles in her life. She was born without an immune system. She was a frequent visitor to the children's hospitals in both Saskatoon and Toronto, and she underwent a bowel transplant in 2023. She had every right to complain; instead, she chose to use her life experience and platform to encourage other kids going through tough times and to spread the overflowing joy that she possessed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8734964"> Having received an organ transplant, she was a strong advocate for signing up to be an organ donor and for the Make-A-Wish foundation. I want to leave members with the words of her mother, Kyla, after Bella passed away: “Bella would want you to remember; God is love, be brave and you are never too old to bring a stuffy.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8734965">Mr. Speaker, cancer is a reality that will affect two in five Canadians, including my mother. Early detection is the key in the fight against this disease. Many organizations are working hard to support all cancer patients, but organizations such as Cancer Warrior Canada Foundation are at the forefront of supporting and empowering cancer patients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8734966"> Last Friday, I was grateful to attend the seventh annual awareness and fundraising gala organized by Cancer Warrior's founder Navneet Sharma, along with board members Sita-Mohan, Nisang, Indu and Akshay. The event featured a survivor walk in which 15 brave survivors showcased outfits designed by Dinesh K. Ramsay. This walk aimed to break the stigma associated with a cancer diagnosis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8734967"> By raising awareness, offering hope and empowering those affected, we can all contribute to saving lives. The work of the Cancer Warrior Canada Foundation exemplifies how collective efforts can have a major impact. Let us all be inspired and support this vital cause.</ParaText>

First, there was the founder, Vesta W. Jobidon, the first women who believed in this cause. Then, Lisette Boivin served as the first executive director from 1989 to 2015. Today, Le Pavois is led by Francine Cyr, a dedicated woman who always has the well-being of her members at heart. Thanks to these remarkable women, our community is able to count on a reliable, recognized mental health resource.</ParaText>

In politics, he was first elected as a Downie Ward councillor, and he would go on to serve as deputy mayor, mayor and three-term warden of Perth County. Jim served as warden during some of the most challenging times the county has faced.

Current legislation fails to include deepfakes. Existing legislation must be amended to address the criminal nature of online harms. A victim-centric approach and more effort are needed to prevent uploading of illegal sexually explicit material. There is a growing need to protect Canadians from the threat of online harms, and the Liberal government's online harms legislation, Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, will not satisfy the need for protection and will only limit the freedoms of Canadians. </ParaText>

Many Canadians are struggling to put food on the table, with more people than ever resorting to food banks for help. Canada's grocery industry is dominated by a handful of large corporations, limiting consumer choice, and in 2023, these corporations reported over $6 billion in profits, all at a time when Canadians were struggling with the cost of food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735253">The bill I am introducing today would develop a national strategy that would help food co-operatives in Canada enable more small and medium-sized businesses compete in Canada's grocery industry. The Competition Bureau Canada has highlighted that encouraging competition in the grocery sector can help lower prices. By supporting the establishment of more food co-operatives, we can foster a more competitive market and can create community-owned businesses. This would ensure greater economic resilience and would promote food security for all Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735258">Mr. Speaker, I rise to table a petition adding 827 names to the thousands of signatures that have already been added to a petition I tabled previously. The petition is about the situation in Hong Kong, and more particularly with respect to the fact that Hong Kong's basic law has completely been eroded and that the national security law imposed by China and adopted in Hong Kong has gotten rid of even the most basic of rights, including freedom of the press.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735259">On August 12, Hong Kong's top court upheld the conviction of seven of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists, including 82-year-old Martin Lee and 76-year-old Jimmy Lai, who was the owner of Apple Daily. That publication has now been shut down and Lai is in jail. In fact, he is actually in court trying to defend himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735260">The offences of these individuals are that they participated in a peaceful demonstration on August 18, 2019. The group of 47, which includes legislators, were found guilty on May 30, in the exercise of their democratic rights for participating in election primaries. These pro-democracy activists have since been sentenced. Some of them face as much as 10 years in prison for their pro-democracy activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735261">Given the extraterritorial reach of the national security law in article 23, there is ongoing fear of surveillance among the Hong Kong diaspora. In light of the recent spying charges laid against staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the U.K., Hong Kongers want to be assured this is not happening in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735262">Therefore petitioners are calling on the Canadian government to call on Hong Kong and the PRC to release Jimmy Lai and the group of 47 and others, whose only crime was to exercise their rights and freedoms as prescribed by the UN human rights declaration; stop according any special rights or diplomatic status to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office; and proactively apply sanctions, under the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Officials Act, against Chinese and Hong Kong officials.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735265">It is very concerning because the events, according to petitioners, all occurred in Captain Paul Watson's efforts to fight whaling activities that were and have been found to be illegal and were carried out by Japanese vessels in international waters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735272">Petitioners want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Eritrea has been ruled by a brutal authoritarian dictator under a totalitarian system for the last 30 years. There is no constitution, no election, no parliament, no freedom of the press and no freedom of movement and association. The people of Eritrea have the same aspirations for freedom and democracy that people always and everywhere have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735273">Eritreans continue to flee indefinite military conscription, religious persecution and political repression. Petitioners note that a very high number of people have fled and yet continue to face threats in the form of foreign interference while they are living elsewhere. Those people who have managed to flee face intimidation and extortion from representatives and agents of the regime that are abroad. People are also harassed and forced to pay large amounts of money because members of their family have fled. </ParaText>

Nobody likes filing their taxes, but petitioners in this case are frustrated by the fact that paper filing is being discouraged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735281">Petitioners note that Canadians need to file their taxes regardless of their level of connectivity. They are frustrated that CRA will no longer print line-by-line instructions in the paper package and will impose financial penalties for paper filing for certain kinds of taxes, including business filing and GST/HST returns. This is unfair to Canadians who do not have the same level of connectivity or who simply prefer to file in other ways.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735283">Mr. Speaker, the next petition is regarding the Liberals' so-called feminist international assistance policy. Petitioners note that the Muskoka initiative, launched by the previous Conservative government, involved historic investments in the well-being of women and girls around the world and that the initiative emphasized value for money and ensured that investments were made in priorities identified by local women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735284">By contrast, petitioners say that the Liberal government's approach has shown a lack of respect for the cultural values and the autonomy of women in the developing world by supporting organizations that violate local laws at the expense of international development priorities like clean water, access to basic nutrition and economic development, and that it pushes ideology at the expense of local priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735285">The petitioners also note how the Liberals' approach to international development for women and girls has been criticized by the Auditor General for its failure to measure results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735286">The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to align international development spending with the approach taken in the Muskoka initiative and to focus international development dollars on meeting the basic needs of vulnerable women around the world, rather than pushing ideological agendas that may conflict with local values in developing countries.</ParaText>

Canada already has the most liberal euthanasia regime in the world, which is being used as a cautionary tale in debates around the world on this very issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735289">This particular petition highlights with grave concern a proposal for the expansion of euthanasia to include babies from birth to one year of age. This was a proposal made by Louis Roy of the Quebec college of physicians and surgeons for the legalized killing of infants. Petitioners see this as morally abhorrent and as the sort of thing that, frankly, a few years ago we never would have expected to hear openly uttered let alone advocated for in Parliament.</ParaText>

Its practitioners have been persecuted for, frankly, no good reason by the Chinese government since 1999.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735294">The petitioners request that Canada take a strong stance against the persecution, and in particular against the practice of organ harvesting. Falun Gong practitioners in many cases, and this is extremely well documented, have been used for involuntary organ harvesting. We can imagine what this results in for the people whose organs are being harvested; it is effectively a form of permitted murder.

              <ParaText id="8735304"> Mr. Speaker, I want to start today by offering a hearty congratulations to the government. The privilege debate in the House is now the longest in recorded Canadian history. I am sure that there is birthday cake, balloons and streamers in the back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735305">Even though this might be a gift for the government, Canadians really want a gift in return. What they want in return is the production of the unredacted documents that the House has asked for and that the government fails to give. It is the power of the House of Commons, the power of the people. We are all elected by the people to ask the government and the government, under the power of Parliament, because of the Speaker's order, needs to give. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735306">We are now six weeks into the House costing taxpayers a million dollars a day and still we have no production of documents. It is really a travesty in the House. We obviously have bigger fish to fry. We have bigger problems. As we stand here, we have a multitude of problems in the country. People are paying 37% more for groceries in Canada than they are in the U.S. We have a housing crisis, the biggest in a generation, where Canadians are paying double for mortgages, rents and down payments. There are 1,400 tent encampments across the country and two million Canadians are lining up at food banks, in Canada, a G7 nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735307">We have the highest household debt in a generation. We are headed into more disaster. In the headlines this week, President-elect Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff that he is going to levy on all goods and services to Canada if Canada does not fix its border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735308">We look at what that means for Canada. It is going to be devastating to all of our sectors. We put much importance on U.S.-Canada trade. We have had an incredible relationship for so long, so much so that we depend on trade for 40% of our economy. Our trade with the U.S. is almost double that of all other countries combined. We have a $1.2-trillion responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735309">We look at what has happened with trade. We have a weak leader, a weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is not able to stand up for Canadians, who does not have a backbone. We are entering a really dangerous period of Canadian economics and Canadian sovereignty, where we are trying to hold on to what we have from CUSMA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735310">The U.S. is not just a partner; it is a lifeline to global trade. The consequences are dismal. If we do not get a trade deal together, if we are not able to stand up to President-elect Trump, then the consequences will be jobs and paycheques. There is going to be a depression for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735311">It happened nine years ago when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected. When the government tried to negotiate with Trump last time, it failed. The government likes to say that it stood up to Trump and won. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735312">I would recommend to anyone Robert Lighthizer's book called <I>No Trade is Free</I>. He was the U.S. trade representative the last time around. In his book, he goes into the details of what happened during the trade negotiations. They were dismal. On June 8, when we hosted the G7 summit and we were supposed to sign CUSMA, supposed to have the trade deal done, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went behind the U.S.'s back. They tried to have a team Canada approach and it failed miserably. They went to the press and said that they had an agreement signed. They rolled over the U.S. government and those representatives and they maddened those representatives. After that June 8 summit, when President-elect Trump left Canada, Canada was sidelined. It was put to the side of CUSMA and, for three months, Mexico got to go into those trade negotiations. Mexico benefited from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735313">Because of that failure in those trade negotiations, Mexico is now the U.S.A.'s number one trading partner and Canada is number three. When Conservatives were in power, we were the U.S.A.'s number one trading partner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735314">It says it right here in the book. The former chief of staff, Peter Navarro, had a really good quote. When he left those meetings on June 8, he said that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a “special place in hell”. Trade relationships were sour. We did not have a Prime Minister who stood up for Canadians and their values and, of course, we saw the end result of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735315">The end result is worse than we could think. Half a trillion dollars of investment has gone south. The average American worker now makes $32,000 more than the average Canadian worker. We have had entrepreneurs, investment and venture capital all escape south. It is not just a bad trade deal; it is increased taxes; it is the fact that we have a planned increase to the carbon tax of 61¢ per litre; we have increased capital gains taxes and we have decreased incentives for entrepreneurs, for investors and for capital as a whole to be placed into Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735316">Because of the lack of trade negotiations, the fact that the President-elect is tweeting, or truthing, that he is going to put these tariffs into place means that we are going to see decreased investment into Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735321"> Mr. Speaker, have no fear, I will get back to markergate. The government seems to be sponsored by Sharpie because it only produces documents that have black ink. There is so much black ink on these documents that the printers have stopped working until they get an apology from the government. It comes back to the point that there are documents the House required and we have been sitting here for six weeks. With the amount of time that this member across the way speaks, I would think that he would love an opportunity to speak about something other than this privilege debate in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735322">Of course we can go back to privilege, but that means we are not dealing with the bigger issues today, including tariffs. What is happening outside these borders does matter. Maybe the member would be delighted to know there are bigger things we would love to be talking about, including the fact that these tariffs on our most important trading relationship in the whole world are going to affect this economy, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not have a plan to deal with the President-elect and he is weak when it comes to standing up for Canadians and what we require in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735323">The whole premise of that is we have an open border. We have more and more documented border incidents. The U.S. customs border agency looked at those numbers and they were pretty phenomenal. The Globe and Mail today talked about the number of incidents at the border in 2021 versus 2023; the number has gone up 1,000%. Last year alone there were over 24 documented incidents. These are not incidents where people are crossing the border and are caught, someone is trying to bring something in or has the wrong documentation; these are people not using a border crossing and crossing into the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735324">When we talk about a porous border and the problems we have with immigration right now, our American counterparts are saying that the longest undefended border in the world is not keeping fentanyl out of their country or our country. It is also not preventing illegal immigration going south. We know the big problems when we look at the news of what is happening from the northern parts of Mexico into the U.S. Americans are saying that it is no longer safe and that our border is allowing some of those instances as well, which is very concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735325">We have to protect our borders, but we also have to ensure that we look at how we are protecting ourselves. One of the biggest problems in Canada right now is that we do not put enough money into our military. The government has planned to cut a billion dollars out of the military budgets at a time when we are not even coming close to meeting our NATO budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735326">When we talk about security we have to link that to trade, and when we talk about trade we have to link that to security. They are intermingled. If we are at the table with NATO, we are not going to find ourselves at the trade table. It is not just looking at our defence and military, it is also defending our borders and ports, where we have massive breaches of cybersecurity.

              <ParaText id="8735328">When we talk about the immigration problem, we also talk about what is happening with the drug problem in Canada. We have 47,000 Canadians who have died from overdoses since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s drug liberalization policies, more deaths than in World War II. We need to emphasize the need for stricter drug policies, border security and prosecuting fentanyl traffickers to save lives and to protect communities. I come from one of those communities. Belleville, Ontario was ground zero for the opioid epidemic; the Municipality of Belleville declared a state of emergency that is still in place. We had 47 overdoses in only 36 hours and just one month ago we had 11 overdoses in two hours. This is an epidemic happening not just in our big city centres, but also in our rural city centres.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735329"> When we look at preventing fentanyl and drug abuse in Canada, it means we have to protect the borders. What our trading partners are saying is that we need to protect the southern part as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735330">We talk about the need to look at what our trading relationship looks like and why we need a strong leader. Canadians believe that we need a strong leader. There was a poll out this week that said 47% of Canadians believe the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> would be the the best leader for dealing with President-elect Trump, while only 17% thought that the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would be best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735331">Donald Trump wants our businesses. He wants our jobs and he wants our resources. He probably wants the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to stay in place, because under him, the Americans have gained investments and jobs. The Prime Minister is putting a tax on carbon, which taxes our farmers and truckers. That puts the price of production up and means that our competitiveness against the Americans is down. They are able to compete against us because we have more taxes. Every time the Prime Minister raises a tax or blocks resource production, the Americans win. That is why they want the Prime Minister in and why it is so imperative that in the future, we have a new prime minister who can stand up for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735332">This is not just about the economy; it is also about entrepreneurship. This week at the trade committee, we had Ms. Dickinson from <I>Dragon's Den</I>. She was talking about the economic gap in Canada. We were asking her if the government really looks after entrepreneurs and investments in Canada and she said no. She said that the increase in capital gains seemed like just a cash grab. She felt that new tax increases on entrepreneurs hurt entrepreneurs like her, women entrepreneurs who are struggling hard to make Canada the place that they invest in, that they take risks in and that they ultimately grow and scale a business in. She said it is not just bad policy; it is economic vandalism. As she put it, there is no plan and no strategy, just tax grabs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735333">Canada needs to stop relying on government band-aids. Entrepreneurs need incentives, private investment and a clear vision for growth. We have to empower innovation and bring prosperity home. That is why we have an economic gap in Canada. When we look at the money needed to invest in businesses, we need to look at what is happening with venture capital. The Americans generate $200 billion of venture capital a year. Venture capital is the money that private investors invest in small, medium and large businesses. In Canada, it is only $6 billion. It used to be $15 billion. We have a problem of generating the capital needed to invest in businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735334">We could go further to talk about the bigger problems we have. We could have open banking in Canada. We have the capacity for not just the five to six big banks that have 95% of all the banking business in Canada. We could allow financial tech organizations to start up, giving access to capital to Canadians and the Canadian entrepreneurs who want to start, scale, innovate and provide great Canadian paycheques. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735335">We want to talk about those things, but we are stuck in a privilege debate because of a green slush fund of $1 billion, $400 million of which, or 40%, was locked into 186 instances of conflicts of interest. Because of that, the public accounts committee decided to make sure we got all the documents related to this $400-million slush fund and provided them to the government as a whole and ultimately to the RCMP. That is why it came to the House. The House decided. It was not just the Conservatives. The government loves to say that the Conservatives are filibustering, but it was Conservative, Bloc and NDP members, who make up a majority of the House, who stated that the government needs to hand over these documents to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735336">People would not believe the excuses we have heard here about why the Liberals would not. For the first couple of weeks, it was that we were violating the Charter of Rights, that somehow Parliament was underneath the charter, even though Parliament is supreme to it. Then, for some reason, the Liberals said the police did not want the documents; they were conducting their own investigation. The third iteration was to say that we should just flip this matter back to committee. Even though it came from committee, they think the answer is for it to go back to committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735337">Ultimately, what this comes down to is that none of those answers hold any water. The only answer the government can give to this place is to answer the authority of Parliament and give the unredacted documents over. That is the only reason we have been here for six weeks locked in the longest privilege debate in Canadian history. The government should be ashamed of itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735338">When we look at the problems across this country, we could be sitting in the House debating a lot of different items and issues. We could be talking about tariffs, how we are going to approach trade and how we are going to fix it. We could be talking about how to help entrepreneurs, women entrepreneurs, who only want to invest, innovate and save in a free Canada. However, we are not. We are in this place debating privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735339">The answer could not be more clear: On behalf of Canadians, the Liberals should hand over the documents, unredacted. The Liberals should get rid of the black ink, lose their sponsorship with Sharpie and give over the documents that Parliament has asked for. If they do not, here is the big problem: It sets a dangerous precedent in this place. If Parliament's authority is wiped out, the people's power in the House is diminished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735340">When we all look around, we see that we have a green House of Commons. Does anyone know why it is green? It is supposed to signify the fields when democracy was handed over to the people from royalty, and we are supposed to represent the common people. That is why it is called the House of Commons. When we walk in here, the ultimate power does not rest with the government, the prime minister or the ministers. All the power of this place rests with the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735341">When the people and Parliament ask for something of the government, the government has to hand it over. It is not “maybe”, it is not “yes, but” and it is not “let's put it to committee”. The Liberals have to hand the documents over. The failure to do that is a failure of democracy. It is a failure to listen to the people of the House, and it shows a government that is tired, a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is weak and, ultimately, a dead government walking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735342">We know that the only answer for that is a carbon tax election, where the people would have the ultimate referendum to decide who should be in power in this place and who should represent them. That is what we are looking for at the end of the day. We are looking for a prime minister who will stand up and put Canada first when it comes to the economy, Canada first when it comes to trade and, most importantly, Canada first when it comes to democracy, putting the people in power and ensuring that the people are in control of the House of Commons. As Laurier said, “Canada first, Canada last, and Canada always.” Let us bring it home.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278176" Type="2">Mrs. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8735379"> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the security-conscious residents of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke to speak to this amendment to the amendment to the motion. The motion calls for an investigation into the Liberal government's ongoing failure to follow an order of the House to produce documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735380">When I last rose in the House to speak to a subamendment to the motion, I highlighted how the failure of the government to produce the documents reflected the contempt the Liberals have for Parliament, our democracy and Canadians. During that speech, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278307" Type="2">Waterloo</Affiliation> was kind enough to prove my point. The member interrupted my speech to claim she could not see the relevance between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s long history of showing contempt for Parliament and a motion concerning the government's current contempt for Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735381"> Today, I would like to make the same argument; however, rather than focusing on the dictatorial views and practices of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, I would like to make the case that the Liberals' incompetence is just as much a threat to democracy. It is my sincere hope that a Liberal MP will prove that point while putting the cherry on top by demonstrating that Liberals also do not listen very well. Canadians have been speaking up and calling for an end to the current government, if we can even call it that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735382"> By definition, for a party to be a government, it has to govern. From this side of the House, it really appears as if the Liberals have just given up governing. The Liberals have abandoned passing legislation. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> has issued instructions to the media to regard our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> as the de facto prime minister and hold him accountable the way they would a real prime minister. The Liberals are completely consumed with their own drama teacher. It is as though they have lost the will to live. Rather than schedule a MAID appointment, the Liberals are just lying in the middle of the road, blocking traffic while Canadian commuters are stuck in the jam. This is all because they refuse to release documents they were ordered to provide by Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735383"> Refusing to listen to Parliament is a recurring pattern with the Liberals. It is very timely that the Special Committee on the Canada-People's Republic of China Relationship has tabled its report on the case of the national microbiology laboratory in Winnipeg. This is especially relevant today because it reveals a pattern of covering up for incompetence. Canadians may recall that the current government refused to hand over documents demanded by Parliament so that we could learn what actually happened at the lab. The government was so determined to ignore the will of Parliament that it took the former Liberal Speaker to court. That was an unprecedented attack on parliamentary democracy. Not only has that never happened before in Canada, but it may have also been a first for any parliamentary democracy. That is how far the Liberals were willing to go to keep the truth from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735384"> Thanks to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s calling his pandemic-spreading election, all the work to hold the Liberals accountable had to be restarted. When the Liberals returned with even fewer votes and fewer seats, they had no choice but to seek a deal. The government would hand over the documents to MPs who were willing to agree to be permanently gagged about what they saw. These MPs would review the redactions the government claimed were necessary for national security; if the members disagreed with the government, the redactions would be reviewed by a panel of arbiters to determine how the information would be made public. The process was what allowed our colleagues to produce the report on what happened at the Winnipeg lab, and I want to thank the members of the committee for their work. The government had been smearing anyone who dared to ask about the lab. This report reveals that we had more than enough reasons to be concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735385"> In August 2018, CSIS met with bureaucrats responsible for security at the lab. CSIS communicated its concerns about the two scientists at the centre of the controversy. The bureaucrats did nothing. In September 2018, the same bureaucrats learned that one of the scientists had been listed as inventor of a patent in China that may have contained information produced in Canada. The bureaucrats did nothing. In October 2018, the same bureaucrats learned that two individuals from China who had been sponsored to work at the national microbiology laboratory by the two disgraced scientists attempted to leave the national lab with 10 tubes in two bags.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735386">That same month, one of the scientists took a trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It was during that time that she signed up for the notorious thousand talents program. Members of that program have been arrested, tried and convicted of espionage in the United States. The program is a major pipeline for the Communists who control China to steal technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735387"> Near the end of October 2018, the scientist's husband tried to leave the lab with two styrofoam containers that he insisted were empty. The bureaucrats did nothing. It was not until December 11, five months after CSIS first spoke with the officials at the Public Health Agency and the national lab, that bureaucrats decided to brief the president of the Public Health Agency. What did the top public health bureaucrat do when presented with these troubling facts? She did what the current government does best: She hired some outside consultants to conduct a fact-finding study. The consultants handed in their report three months later, on March 23, 2019, and their recommendation was an administrative investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735388">While the bureaucrats were busy hiring consultants to conduct studies to recommend investigations, on March 31, the two Communist agents shipped out live samples of Ebola and henipavirus to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It was not until the end of May 2019 that the public health bureaucrats picked up the phone and called the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735389"> More than two months passed; the two scientists were escorted from the lab by the RCMP in July 2019. The Public Health Agency did not officially terminate their employment until January 2021. We were paying a salary to two Communist agents while the government told them to sit at home and await further instructions. Unsurprisingly, these scientist spies did not listen; they moved back to China, out of reach of Canada's legal system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735390"> To sum it up, CSIS warned government officials of a threat posed by agents working on behalf of the Communists who control China. The senior government officials downplayed the concerns until it all blew up in their faces. No one bothered to brief the Liberals, or the Liberals did not bother to read their briefs. This is the same brand of incompetence that led to the public inquiry into foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735391"> The Liberals ignored the warnings because they did not want to believe them. Liberals had fully bought into the belief that Russia had installed the 45th president and was plotting to do the same here in Canada, so it was easy for them to believe that someone they did not like received help from an odious regime. When the Liberals learned they were being assisted by the most odious regime on earth, the cognitive dissonance hit really hard. Taking real action would have meant admitting that they were not white knights in shining armour and, in fact, were no better than any politician they despised next door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735392"> The Liberals reassured themselves by saying such things as “intelligence is not evidence”. It is ironic that Canadians can find no evidence of intelligence inside the government. Obviously, when talking about spies inside one of Canada's two most secure biolabs, issues of national security come into play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735393">That does not give the government the right to ignore Parliament, but it can explain a government's reluctance to make information public. However, what our colleagues saw was that nearly all the redactions were aimed at protecting the bureaucrats from embarrassment. Our colleagues were the ones who were gagged so that they could review the documents. The bureaucrats let spies run free in the most secure lab in Canada; they then sought to cover up their incompetence and tell the gullible Liberal ministers that, for national security reasons, the documents could not be shared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735394"> The DEI Liberal ministers lack the intellectual fortitude to challenge their deputies, which brings us back to today and to this motion. However, there is one major difference: Nothing about the green slush fund involves national security. This is a classic case of Liberals helping to enrich Liberals. We saw it in the sponsorship scandal. In Ontario, we saw it with the Green Energy Act. When those McGuinty-Wynne Liberals were booted from office, they packed up their taxpayer-funded moving vans and came to Ottawa to run the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735395">It is clear that the only reason the Liberals refuse to release the documents is that the documents would reveal the full extent of the corruption. It has left them resorting to ridiculous excuses. My favourite is the claim that the Liberal insiders have a charter right to steal taxpayers' dollars. That is the level of desperation they have descended to.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735396"> They can make as many excuses as they want. They can invent as many fake rights as they want. None of it matters. Canada will always be a parliamentary democracy and in a parliamentary democracy, the government answers to Parliament. This is not open to debate or interpretation. It is a fact. They must release the documents. While they are at it, they can release the names too. However, the Liberals will not. They will not let Canadians see the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735397">Providing the documents would make it easier for Canadians to connect the dots, including dots like the proud socialist <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> having a financial interest in a venture capital fund, like the owner of the venture capital fund sitting on the board of SDTC during this period of Liberal corruption, and like SDTC giving funds to companies that the venture capital fund had also invested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735398">The Liberals were so happy with this venture capitalist's work on the SDTC board, handing money out to their friends, that the cabinet appointed her to sit on the board of the Liberal Infrastructure Bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735399">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>'s favourite capitalist came to committee and was adamant that she had always recused herself from decisions relating to companies she had interest in. She also insisted there were only two companies. Naturally, my colleagues were curious. They had a list of companies that SDTC had given funds to and a list of companies that the venture capitalist had invested in. The names that matched up on both lists were more than two, quite a bit more. The environmental activist turned venture capitalist had an explanation at hand. She simply explained that her venture capital fund only invested in the company after it had received SDTC funding. She was the longest-serving board member and sat on the project review committee. What a cozy little relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735400">The taxpayer-funded Sustainable Development Technology Corporation employees would receive applications from hundreds of companies every year. These hard-working, diligent employees reviewed the applications and filtered out the duds. After this long application process, only the most viable projects from the most viable companies were recommended by the staff at SDTC. Those recommendations went to the project review committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735401">I believe the venture capitalist when she insists she followed the conflict of interest rules. She had been on the board long enough before the former minister for Rogers decided to stack the board with friends. She would not do anything to jeopardize her access to the SDTC pipeline of promising investment opportunities. Researching investment opportunities is what makes or breaks a venture capital company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735402">Luckily for her and her investors, like the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, she had taxpayers fund her research. I always thought the man the Montreal newspapers like to call the “Green Jesus of Montreal” was an odd fit for the Liberals. It must be pretty awkward for the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> having to condemn the watermelon brigade protesters who come to their homes and target their families when their colleague was arrested for invading the property of former premier of Alberta Ralph Klein.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735403">When I learned that the same man who stood in the House and declared himself to be a proud socialist was really a venture capitalist, it all made sense. He is a raging hypocrite and a perfect fit for the Liberal Party. He preaches socialism for the people but practises capitalism for himself and his well-connected Liberal friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735404"> For Canadians watching at home now or in the future, I ask that they consider the case of the proud socialist <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> and his friend the venture capitalist. We have laws prohibiting public officials from conflicts of interest. We have laws against corruption. If laws were broken, the evidence will come out, if not by the current government, then by the next. What we do not have are laws preventing well-connected Liberals from taking advantage of every opportunity to enrich themselves. The Minister of Environment likes to claim all his carbon taxes will create economic opportunities. That was the same pitch Dalton McGuinty used when he brought in the Green Energy Act in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735405">Ontario's Auditor General found the Green Energy Act destroyed 60,000 jobs and cost ratepayers billions of dollars in extra fees. However, well-connected Liberals made a fortune by forcing industrial wind turbines down the throats of small rural communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735406">As we saw with the case of the venture capitalist, she followed the conflict rules to the letter so she could continue to find promising investment opportunities at the taxpayers' expense. Those same taxpayers, hard-working Canadians, never get those same opportunities. Now the proud socialist venture capitalist, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, gets richer while Canadians line up at food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735407">The government can make a show of shutting down SDTC, but in the end, it feels like we are all playing a game of Whac-a-Mole. Just as we knock down a bunch of well-connected Liberals at SDTC, new ones pop up at the Infrastructure Bank or the local journalism initiative. We know the $400 million given out at SDTC was only the tip of the iceberg, which brings us back to the motion and the amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735408">As I have explained, this is not about national security. There is no reason to withhold the documents. The government's excuses have become ridiculous. The government even claimed handing over the documents to the RCMP would violate people's rights. I would ask Canadians to think about what the government is claiming. Well-connected Liberals may have broken laws to enrich themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735409">The victims in this case are the Government of Canada and, through it, the taxpayers of Canada. Now the Liberal Party is claiming that to share evidence, the government would be victimized and it would violate the Charter rights of well-connected Liberals. Imagine if the government took this view on all crime. It would be like telling a rape victim she cannot describe the appearance of her attacker to police because it would violate his right to privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735410">While this example is meant to illustrate just how absurd the government's argument for withholding the documents is, there is probably some woke academic working on a paper arguing that reporting crime violates the rights of criminals from marginalized communities. While this idea might become part of some future Liberal platform, I have not seen or heard any policy announcement from the government that would prevent the victim of crime from providing evidence of a crime to police. For now, it is still legal for victims to report crimes against them to police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735411">The government's claim it cannot turn over documents to the RCMP falls apart like a wet paper straw. That means there are only two plausible scenarios for why the government refuses to hand over the documents. The first is what we will call the bio lab scenario. Just as we saw in the Winnipeg lab case, the bureaucrats were embarrassed by the fact they had allowed a couple of spies to run free in what was supposed to be one of the most secure facilities on the planet. Those bureaucrats told their political masters the documents needed to be redacted for national security and the Liberals were too incompetent to ask any tough questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735412">In this situation, the bureaucrats at Industry Canada tasked with oversight of Sustainable Development Technology Canada failed at their job and do not want the public to know. These bureaucrats told their political masters the documents cannot be released because it would violate people's due process rights and the Liberal government is too incompetent to realize it is being duped. Incredibly, this first option is the best-case scenario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735413">The second possible option is the ad scam scenario. In this case, the documents contain evidence of criminality beyond just failures to recuse for conflicts of interest. We know the Auditor General only looked at a sample of the funds handed out by Navdeep Bains' hand-picked board members. Only the documents in the possession of the government would reveal the true scale of the government. The government cannot hand them over to the RCMP because that would only result in well-connected Liberals being arrested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735414">As this tired, worn-out, weak government prepares for the Hail Mary of election campaigns, the last thing it wants is a series of stories covering the trials of well-connected Liberals. Covering up for rampant criminality is objectively terrible, but it would at least rationally explain why the so-called government has abandoned governing and given up on Parliament altogether. We must never assume malice when incompetence is still an option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735415">Fortunately, whether the government is acting with criminality or from incompetence, the solution is the same. It is time for a carbon tax election, because only a carbon tax election can end the corruption of well-connected Liberals helping well-connected Liberals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735440"> Madam Speaker, before I begin, I would like to say that it was an honour to join those at the Lucan Scout and Guide Hall as it celebrated its 40th anniversary, which is a truly remarkable milestone. The event was filled with nostalgia and excitement, especially as I had the privilege to witness the opening of a time capsule that had been sealed since 1984. It was fascinating to see the items and memories preserved from the past, each one telling a unique story about the people and events that shaped the group's history. The experience was not only nostalgic, but also deeply inspiring, reminding everyone present of the enduring gift of scouting and community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735441">What made the day even more special was the opportunity to contribute to the legacy being created. I presented the hall with a new portrait of King Charles III for the participants to hang for future generations.

              <ParaText id="8735442">I send my congratulations once again to the Lucan Scout and Guide Hall on 40 years of incredible service, dedication and community building.

              <ParaText id="8735447">We are here today again debating a privilege motion, which I have spoken to once before. We are here because the Liberal government does not want to produce unredacted documents to give to the RCMP. I would like to read into the record a list of every Liberal scandal that I could find. I will give fair warning that the list is not exhaustive, and I strongly believe that most rational individuals will believe that the government has not finished adding to the count. Traditionally, we would have the 12 days of Christmas, but after nine years of NDP-Liberal government, I bring members 68 scandals this Christmas instead. Let us take a walk down scandal lane together as we review the 68, and counting, Liberal scandals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735448">There was the Aga Khan vacation scandal and the prison needle exchange program. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pressured the then justice minister to get Liberal donor SNC-Lavalin off the hook and fired that justice minister for not helping with the cover-up. There was the “people experience things differently” response to groping allegations and the WE Charity scandal. The Prime Minister assaulted an NDP MP in the House of Commons and prorogued Parliament to escape the WE Charity scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735449">The Liberals sent personal protective equipment to China during a pandemic and gave hundreds of thousands of dollars in ventilator contracts to Liberal Party insider Frank Baylis. There were the fake charges against Mark Norman. There is rampant sexual assault in the military, and they illegally invoked the Emergencies Act, fabricating reasons to explain the Emergencies Act being invoked. The Public Health Agency of Canada was found in contempt of Parliament in the Winnipeg lab document scandal, and there was the Public Health Agency tracking scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735450">There was the trampling of Canadians with horses and the seizing of Canadians' bank accounts. There was rampant abuse of staff in the office of the then governor general, who was appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and the Governor General wasted over $100,000 to throw private jet parties. There were Liberal connections with illegal casino magnate, vaccine delays and unwarranted vaccine mandates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735451"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> dressed up in racist costumes on an official trip to India and dressed up in racist blackface costumes at least three times over 11 years, but this number is only how many times the Prime Minister can remember doing so. There were the mass airport delays and cancellations, and there was the decriminalization of hard drugs. The flag was lowered for half a year, and the Prime Minister polluted more in one year on his private jet than an average Canadian does in half a lifetime. There were also more than 72 secret orders in council. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735452"> The Liberals sent diplomats to a party at the Russian embassy during the invasion of Ukraine, and they have a <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who gave a $17,000 contract to a Liberal-aligned media firm. They let Thomson Reuters take the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s chief of staff to the White House press correspondents' dinner, and the DND minister misrepresented service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735453">The Liberals tried to get unwarranted border searches of electronics, and they restricted online free speech. They spent $11 million to renovate the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s cottage, raised the carbon tax during an energy crisis, ignored racist laws in Quebec and misinformed Canadians about electoral reform. The Prime Minister skipped the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to go surfing in Tofino</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735454">The Liberals were eliminating mandatory minimums for gun offences while going after law-abiding firearms owners. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is flying in his private jet to climate conferences and was partying in Scotland maskless while Canadians were still under lockdowns. The Liberals failed reforms in the ATIP system and awarded contracts to government employees without proper bids, such as those with GC Strategies for the ArriveCAN, or arrive scam, app. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735455">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had an $8-million barn built at Harrington Lake and a Jamaica vacation that cost Canadian taxpayers at least $162,000. We have the Liberal cover-ups of foreign interference with the family friend rapporteur, Liberals not naming foreign threats, and the Bernardo and Magnotta prison transfers. The Liberals have a known compromised MP on their benches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735456">There was the former Speaker's Nazi scandal and the Liberals' waiting to designate the IRGC as a terrorist group. We have skyrocketing debt, skyrocketing inflation, skyrocketing addictions and skyrocketing overdose deaths. Other scandals include other Randy, the incompetent mismanagement of CERB, the failing promises on Senate reform and an anti-Semitic human rights chair. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735457">The ECCC politicized the Jasper wildfire response, and a $9-million penthouse was purchased for Tom Clark. There is the illegal plastics ban and the green slush fund, or SDTC, which is why we are here today. There are the CBC bonuses, the CBC CEO's travel to Paris and the immigration crisis. The Liberals are pulling refunds away from farmers for unnecessary fertilizer tariffs and then charging them interest. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> awarded funding to his own company. There is India's criminal activity and how it was announced and then retracted. We found out there was no other Randy. Now there is $6.5 billion to be spent in a shallow attempt to buy votes. There is more to come, I am sure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735458">That is the over 68 scandals from the last nine years. Meanwhile, Canadians are struggling to eat, heat and house themselves. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government and its heavy-handed carbon tax, that is what is happening in Canada. The government has a pattern of giving its friends hundreds of millions of dollars, taxpayer dollars, while shirking responsibility for all it has done to destroy Canadians' livelihoods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735459">McKinsey &amp; Company, the consultants being sued because of their role in providing hard drugs to Canadians, has been awarded $200 million in contracts since 2015. Most of the time the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s WEF buddy, Dominic Barton, led the board of directors, only to run off when the drug market became too hot for him. Members need not worry. The Prime Minister failed to hold Dominic Barton accountable for contributing to one of Canada's greatest calamities, and one of the NDP-Liberals' greatest calamities since they formed government, but he did give him a position in government as the Canadian ambassador to the People's Republic of China, of all things. With drug-related overdose deaths increasing 400% after his legalization experiment and overdose deaths becoming the number one cause of death for teenagers, do we think a big promotion and a paycheque for another Liberal insider was worth the tax dollars? I think most Canadians, and in fact all Canadians, would say no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735460">Let us go back over the McKinsey contracts to let Canadians know about how their $200 million was spent. The Auditor General report cites that 90% of its contracts did not have the appropriate guidelines. It was not even clear what the purpose of the contract was or if the desired outcome was achieved, with 70% of contracts being non-competitive and sole-sourced directly to McKinsey, without a single attempt to explain why a non-competitive process was justified. McKinsey even raised a statement of work to skirt the Canada Border Services Agency after its initial statement did not qualify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735461">This is not how we manage a free, fair and democratic society. It will take years, if not decades, to recover from the calamity and restore public trust. With thousands of Canadians dead, many more addicted to hard drugs and every Canadian taxpayer robbed, it is certain the NDP-Liberal government is not worth the crime, the corruption or the cost. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735462">Another scandal the incompetent NDP-Liberal government has been involved with that people are still livid about is the arrive scam app. While Canadians struggled through the implications of the pandemic, the NDP-Liberal government managed to waste at least $60 million on an app that did not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735463">The app was originally designed for declaring customs in advance, but the only thing the app completed was enriching a shady, two-man, IT company that had ties to senior Liberal politicians. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not only allowed this to take place but also defended it. Initially budgeted at $80,000, the app's cost ballooned to over $60 million. Let us think about that: An app that was mimicked by university students in a basement over a weekend somehow cost taxpayers $60 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735464">The Auditor General not only reported that the arrive scam app cost around $60 million but also admitted that the exact cost was impossible to calculate due to CBSA's poor record keeping. CBSA also reported that $12.2 million of the $60 million could be unrelated to the app. Where did the money go? It went to Liberal insiders. What a surprise that is. While Canadians are struggling, the NDP-Liberal government has put its own interests ahead of Canada, hidden the truth rather than face accountability and wasted taxpayer dollars on pipe dreams and vanity projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735465"> The report also states that GC Strategies was paid up to $19 million, when the original cost was $9 million. GC Strategies was handed a non-competitive contract, despite there being no record of a request or even a proposal. For an app that cost $60 million, it did not work at all. The app's failure actually led to 10,000 Canadians being quarantined despite doing everything right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735466"> Canadians deserve to know where their taxpayer dollars are going and why their money is going to waste. While Canadians did their best to stay healthy and safe, the Liberals spent their money around programs that did not work, in order to line the pockets of their elite friends. Canadians are paying the price, not only in higher taxes and rising costs but also in blatant corruption that has affected the very top of the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735467">We would think the Liberals had learned a lesson, but alas no. Let us take a look at another ethics scandal involving one of Canada's now most notorious ministers, the now unemployed former minister of employment. It has come to light that he maintained ties to a lobbyist who secured a staggering $110 million in federal contracts. That is not all; the minister himself was also a director of a company that raked in an additional $8 million in government contracts. This is not just mismanagement; it is deceit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735468">It has been reported that the minister tried to conceal payments he was receiving from his own lobbying firm while the same firm was lobbying his own ministry. I cannot believe it, but it gets worse. Text messages from the minister's business partner showed that a Randy was in regular contact with the co-owner of the company even while serving as minister. What was his excuse? He claims it was just another Randy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735469">Canadians deserve better than this. They deserve better than the flimsy excuse from a senior cabinet minister. We have learned that the same business allegedly claimed to be indigenous-owned despite the minister's repeatedly stating that he is not indigenous. This is a clear pattern with the Liberal government, lining its own pockets while Canadians struggle to make ends meet. The cost of living is skyrocketing and families are forced to make very tough choices, yet Liberal ministers seem more concerned with enriching themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735470"> An affidavit filed last week claims that a company co-founded by the former minister and his partner took a $250,000-deposit for medical gloves that were never delivered. Even though the minister was supposed to cut ties with the company after his re-election in 2021, it is clear he continued to co-own and benefit from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735471">Canadians are tired of the lies, the cover-ups and the complete disregard for ethical standards. They deserve accountability. How much money was taken from hard-working taxpayers? Did the minister defraud indigenous people by falsely claiming an indigenous identity? It is not enough that he lost his job and that his company is barred from receiving federal contracts for 90 days. That is a slap on the wrist for this level of corruption and indecency.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735472">Canadians deserve a government that is transparent, accountable and focused on serving the people, not on serving itself. It is time for a common-sense Conservative government to restore trust, integrity and fiscal responsibility in Ottawa. If what I have said is not enough to make members agree, let us unpack a few more things that have happened recently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735473">The Liberal government placed a massive tariff on fertilizer coming from Russia when the invasion of Ukraine began, and most of the fertilizer that is used in Ontario and Quebec comes from Russia. Farmers pre-ordered and prepaid, months in advance, for what they required for the spring planting. Such a sudden change drove prices through the roof and helped contribute to the inflation on food prices that Canadians still suffer from.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735480">It is beyond ridiculous to suggest that a decision impacting farmers' livelihood and costing millions of dollars did not follow procedure or was not grounded with a law or policy. It is absurd for the government to suggest that such a decision would and could be made by an individual CBSA agent. However, in the wacko government, apparently nobody bothered to check first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735481"> Now let us look at the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and her vibe cheque, because yes, now the government is slashing temporarily and spending $6.28 billion in a thinly veiled attempt to buy votes from Canadians who are already earning a six-figure income. One might think that they could take a moment and think to use some of the money to pay off the over $1.2 trillion in national debt, but why would they? Going deeper in the hole for showmanship and self-glorification is the ultimate Liberal play, tried and true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735482"> Do not take my word for it; here is testimony from Jeff, the owner of a small business in my riding: “How does the government expect my small business to take HST off of all of these items in one night? We have to collect the HST December 13 and have it off on December 14. How am I supposed to manually do this for all the items in a convenience store? It would be easier to close my business for two months than to do all of this. This is an absolute joke and a travesty to lay this on small business owners and right before Christmas and for only two months. It's going to take me a week to manually change every item. If I get it wrong, I'm going to be charged interest by our government. What an absolute embarrassment of a government, and no wonder no one wants to start a small business anymore.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735483"> Small businesses are the backbone of the Canadian economy, and what I hear when I am speaking with Canadians is that from farms to convenience stores, everything the NDP-backed Liberal government is doing is set to destroy them. Canadians are tired of the relentless, oppressive flood of ineptitude coming from our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his horde of yes-men and yes-women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735484"> People do not want policy and government run from scribbles off the back of a napkin. They deserve a positive change. They want hope for a better future. They want common sense, and only a Conservative government will give them that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735485">We will axe the tax, letting people keep more of their money that they worked so hard for. We will build homes, starting by removing the GST on new builds, which will save people up to $50,000, and get an additional 30,000 homes built every year. We will fix the budget, beginning with a dollar-for-dollar rule to curb excessive government spending. We will stop the crime by repealing the broken catch-and-release bail policies that are endangering our lives.</ParaText>

This is a time when we are talking about something that is important, but it is very sad. I would go as far as to say that I am quite despondent about where we sit as a Parliament. We are essentially at an impasse, which falls directly at the feet of the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735543">Madam Speaker, there is an order from the Chair that you occupy right now that says the government is to turn over the documents. Only the Liberals could be so brash as to try to reframe the conversation. I talked about conspiracy theories from the left. It is not a conspiracy theory when we have to ask what is in those documents. Has it been 36 days now? A number of days have gone by, and we have been demanding the documents. What could possibly be in those documents that is so damning that the Liberals do not want to do it? </ParaText>

It is because this is a corrupt government that loves to line its own pockets. We know there were 186 conflicts of interest, while the Liberals sat on their hands, worth $400 million. They attempt to justify it. They sit here and say that it is no big deal, wink-wink, nudge-nudge; we should talk about some other conspiracy theory of the left. It is absolutely deplorable that we have to sit here demanding these documents be put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735547"> Let us go back in our history, if we can. In 2018, given public criticism, the former Liberal industry minister expressed concerns with respect to the Harper-era chair; two alternate chairs were then put forward. Lo and behold, what happened? Liberals love to benefit Liberals. It is just the way of life. Just as water is wet, Liberals love to line Liberal pockets. A Liberal-friendly chair takes the chair of SDTC, also known as the green slush fund, and we have 186 conflicts of interest. We have what I believe to be clear criminality at its core. People were voting on giving one another money. This was money for green projects, something that should ostensibly be laudable. Yes, let us make our economy greener. However, in the eyes of the Liberal insiders and the Liberal government, the whole point of SDTC was not to make our economy greener but to line Liberal pockets. That is absolutely deplorable. Then, to make matters worse, the government refuses to hand over the unredacted documents. Liberals like to line their own pockets, and they like to get richer and richer. When they are caught, they refuse to hand over the documents. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8735567"> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be here in the House this evening to discuss a government bill, Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document>, and to finally be moving forward on behalf of Canadians. This is important legislation that will deliver meaningful savings for Canadians with a GST/HST exemption across the country. Canadians will be able to buy essentials, such as groceries, snacks and kids' clothing, all tax-free. It is a bill that is focused on making life more affordable for Canadians and building on previous government actions that are already saving families and individuals thousands of dollars a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735568">As Canadians, we take care of each other. It is a promise at the heart of who we are, and it goes back generations. From universal public health care to employment insurance and strong, stable, funded pensions such as the Canada pension plan, there has always been an agreement that we will take care of our neighbours when they are in need. It gives our workers stability and our businesses the confidence that the right supports will be in place to keep our country and economy fair; keep people healthy, safe, ready and well-supported; and keep the middle class strong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735569">On the other side of the aisle, we see a party obsessed with making devastating cuts to child care, dental care, housing and pretty much everything else that supports Canadians' affordability, leaving the middle class worse off. That is what the Conservative Party will do if it is ever fortunate enough to form government. Conservatives are not interested in investing in Canadians. They are only interested in their own political advantage and gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735570">In 2015, our government recognized that the economy had changed. Canadians needed more support. We created the Canada child benefit to help with the cost of raising children. Today, that benefit is providing nearly $8,000 per child. It is indexed to the cost of living, which allows families to keep up with the cost of living as it naturally tends to increase over time. We promised and delivered affordable child care from coast to coast to coast, with eight provinces and territories already providing care for $10 a day or less. Before 2021, child care fees in Canada cost as much as, if not more than, rent or a mortgage; few parents could afford it. When my family had our first young daughter, child care was up to $1,800 per month, and it certainly had my wife and I pause and consider whether both of us were going to go back to work. That is the case for many parents. We realized that this support, the Canada child benefit, made it cheaper and easier both for parents to return to work and for kids to get the best start possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735571">Liberals knew that it was fundamentally unjust that families should struggle, especially mothers, which is why we created a high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive Canada-wide early learning and child care system. In less than a year, we reached early learning and child care agreements with all 13 provinces and territories. That is remarkable. Provinces and territories have already announced measures to create over 100,000 new spaces, and we are well on our way to reaching our goal of 250,000 new spaces by March 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735572"> We have also never forgotten that the promise of access to health care is at the heart of Canada's social safety. That includes ensuring access to affordable dental care. The Canadian dental care plan is making the cost of dental care more affordable for up to nine million Canadians. Thanks to the Canada dental care plan, over one million Canadians have now been able to visit a dentist and access the oral health care they need and deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735573">In budget 2024, we announced an investment of $1 billion over five years to launch the new national school food program with provinces, territories and indigenous partners. This is something I long advocated for, for many years, before getting into politics. I have known many people in the national food movement who advocated for a national school food program. It was an investment from the federal government for many years before that. It is a great pleasure to be part of a party and a government that is investing in kids, ensuring that they get a healthy start to each and every day at school.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735574"> Liberals have already signed agreements with three provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba and Ontario, which is great. My home province of Ontario has finally signed up. It is not last like we saw with the early learning and child care agreements. Ontario was third. It is fantastic to see Ontario join and make these investments in our kids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735575">The program will provide meals for up to 400,000 more children every year, with 160,000 of those being in Ontario, beyond those served by the existing school food programs, so that every single child across Canada can have a fair chance at a good and healthy life, regardless of their family circumstances. This national program is expected to save an average participating family with two children as much as $800 a year in the cost of groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735576">It is a shame the Conservative members opposite voted against this program. They voted against feeding kids in school. Can people believe that? Every day in this House, for months and months, they cite food bank lineups and the HungerCount report from Food Banks Canada, which has asked for an investment in a national school food program for as long as I can remember. Our government steps up to make that investment and what do the Conservatives do? They vote against it. They vote against feeding hungry kids. That is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735577">That brings me to today's legislation on the GST holiday with the goal of putting even more money in the pockets of Canadians. Canadians have been through a lot, there is no doubt about that. They have had the pandemic, post the pandemic, shocks to the economy and global inflation. We have had major climactic events and weather events that have obviously put a strain on our economy. Canadians have been living through all that, and we realize it has been challenging. We know this, and we want to step up and help, as we always have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735578">Our government, and I am proud of this, always identifies and listens to what Canadians need. We are responsive and trying our very best to govern this country in a way that steps up constantly and supports Canadians when they are in need. We are offering good news this holiday season. This Christmas is going to be more merry and bright, is how I think about it, because Canadian families are going to be able to purchase a lot of the things that they would purchase over the holidays with no GST on those purchases. That is really good for Canadian families who have been challenged with the cost of living pressures that they have been living through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735579">All of this comes on the tail of really good news for our economy. Inflation was at 2% in October, which means inflation has been within the Bank of Canada's target range all year long. For Canadians, that means prices are more stable. It means that interest rates are coming down, and they have come down four times, which is great to see. That is great news for homeowners, for people renewing their mortgages and for business owners who might be carrying debt. This is solid progress and we should not deny this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735580">I know the members opposite constantly deny that the economy is steadily improving and stable, and that Canada is doing better than many of its peer countries in this world. The Conservatives cherry-pick indicators from the economy to try and talk down the Canadian economy because they do not want Canada to do well. They would rather Canada do poorly so that they can do well, so that they can use the misfortune of Canadians for their own political advantage, and we see that every single day in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735581">I think Canadians have been going through a lot. This holiday season, the Liberals are waiving the GST on many of the things that they spend money on. This is going to start on December 14. The government intends to give a tax break to Canadians. Why is today's legislation so important? Why is time of the essence? Time is of the essence because we know Canadians need a boost. They need to feel like they can afford more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735582">Although the economy is improving, Canadians are not always feeling that immediately. Liberals think that offering them a GST holiday for two months over the Christmas period is really going to be helpful to them. The temporary, two-month GST/HST exemption for select expenses will help Canadians be able to buy items like snacks, and children's clothing and toys, all tax-free. It will also apply to prepared foods, vegetable trays, premade meals, salads, sandwiches, books, newspapers, puzzles, Christmas trees and more.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735583"> This exemption is designed to help Canadians with many of the things they purchase over the holidays. I think that is great. It would make the holidays just a little better for Canadians and give them a bit of relief. It would boost the economy in terms of the spending Canadians do as well, because I think they will support our retail industry, which will boost local businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735584">For a typical family spending $2,000 on qualifying goods between December 14 and February 15, 2025, it would mean a savings of $100, keeping more money in their pockets. With this support, Canadians could focus more on celebrating the season with family and friends and start the new year with a little more money in their pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735585">However, yet again, we see the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> and his MPs putting their partisan interests above Canadians. They voted against dental care. They voted against the national school food program. They would cut the Canada child benefit, there is no doubt. They would cut the housing supports and investments our government has made. They also voted against more spots in day care, and they are going to vote against the tax break we are offering Canadians to help them over the next few months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735586">I encourage all members of Parliament to quickly and unanimously pass this legislation to make the holidays a little more merry and bright for Canadians who have been going through a tough time. “Make their Christmas” is my message to every member of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735587">The question I have for the Conservatives is the following: Will the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> unmuzzle his MPs and let them vote in favour of this legislation? Will he let them vote in favour of their constituents, who deserve a tax break over the holidays? Will Conservatives support their constituents? I have no idea, but what we see every day in the House is that they are not working on behalf of Canadians. They are working on behalf of themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735588">If Conservative members need help filling out a permission slip for their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> to give them permission to speak their mind and vote their conscience in the House, I would offer my help. I will even create a permission slip for them if they need, and advocate on their behalf. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735589">Hopefully, Conservatives will be able to stand up for Canadians for once and actually support a tax break for Canadians over the holidays. It really gives me great pleasure to get to kick off the debate on this topic tonight. It is great to see the House finally doing business that matters to Canadians, instead of hearing Conservatives filibuster for 36 days on a motion they will not allow to be referred to procedure and House affairs committee and wasting all kinds of time, energy and resources at the heart of our democracy. It will be great to get a GST/HST cut over the holidays for Canadian families. </ParaText>

They did this back in 2015 when the Liberal government first got into power and offered a middle-class tax cut. I do not know if members remember that, but it was a great measure.

              <ParaText id="8735621">Even though we were not making much money, at that time, people could still afford a home, pay their rent or afford a mortgage payment. They could also go to the grocery store and were still able to get a week's worth of groceries with a powerful paycheque. This is why people keep asking, “What happened to Canada?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735622">I was an at-risk youth who lived through a lot of poverty and did not think there would be much of a future. My parents also did not think I would have much of a future just because of the way I grew up. I was very fortunate to grow up in the riding I get to represent today. That is the voice I bring to the House, for those people who grew up just like me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735623">Today the difference is, after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government, the Canada we all once knew is gone. The Canadian dream my and many other immigrant families came here for, and those who were born and grew up here knew about, where people could put in hard work, earn a powerful paycheque, live in a community safe from drugs, especially government-funded drugs, and safe from being abused or even murdered. We see today the rise in violent crime. That was the difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735624">It only took nine years of the incompetent, weak Liberal-NDP <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to turn this country into what it is today. I could not have imagined we would be living in a country where over two million people visit a food bank in a single month, a third of whom are children. One in four people in this country are skipping meals and parents are doing it so they have enough food to give their kids. This is something I know about very well because I saw it in my own household, but we could still afford our rent then. We could still get groceries, even though we had to delay when we got them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735625">Today, we hear about moms putting water in their kids' milk just so they can stretch it out. They are buying less nutritious food and going shopping in the almost-expired aisles because that is all they can afford. There are other concerning statistics we have never seen in Canada before. One in five children live in poverty in this country. Child poverty is up after nine years of the incompetent Liberal-NDP government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735626">Canada has had the worst living standards of the last 40 years. Our GDP per capita has been on the decline for two years. In fact, technically, we are in a GDP-per-capita recession. In simple terms, Canadians are getting poorer. It is not just a term we use but what Canadians are feeling today. As much as the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> says the Liberals are in a vibecession, whatever that means, the vibe is clear in this country. Canadians are getting poorer. They are suffering or else two million of them would not be lining up at food banks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735627">Our jobs, our businesses and our investment are fleeing to the U.S., where there are fewer regulations and a better return on investment. In fact, almost half a trillion dollars' worth of our Canadian jobs and investment has gone to the U.S. It is making U.S. workers richer and the U.S. economy better, building pipelines in the U.S., and Canada is left footing the bill. That is what nine years of incompetence does. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has driven our good jobs and good investment out of Canada. That is the vibe of Canada today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735628">There was an explosion in population growth, even though the incompetent former immigration minister was warned by his own department that it was about to explode the immigration levels. There was already a housing crisis. They warned him it was only going to get worse. He ignored it. Just like this two-month temporary tax trick to buy votes, they exploded the population for votes and votes only. What did that do? It did exactly what his department told him it would, the same thing he ignored. It made housing even worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735629">What kind of a government spends almost $89 billion on housing and sees housing costs double? What kind of measure of success is that? Is it really something to celebrate? Is it really a vibecession that it spent so much money to achieve such a horrible outcome? All of these people the Liberals brought here in search of getting more votes for themselves are now living under bridges and sleeping in their cars; they cannot afford housing because the Liberals have doubled housing costs. That is the reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735630">Do members remember when we used to be able to go to the grocery store and get a full week of groceries for $200? What does $200 get us now? It gets barely a bag, maybe a little more. That is why people are suffering so badly in this country. That is what nine years of incompetence from the Liberal-NDP government has done. When it doubles the national debt and food bank usage, it is nothing but misery for the good people who just want to work hard and make something for themselves and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735631">What does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do after doing all of that to them? He continues to kick them down harder. He kicks them down with a punishing carbon tax scam, one that takes more from Canadians than they get back in fake rebates, which was proven by the Liberals' own Parliamentary Budget Officer, and one that does not help to reduce emissions. We know that because their own department told us that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735632">They have no measure that tells us how much lower the emissions would be if they increased the carbon tax scam, because they know it is like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, not worth the cost. However, Canadians are left with that cost. They see that cost when they fill up with gas, when they go to the grocery store and when they have to turn up the heat, which they are all doing now since winter has started. They do not have the luxury of the multi-millionaire trust fund baby Prime Minister. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735633"> They actually have to go grocery shopping themselves, unlike the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They have to pump gas themselves. They have to drive their kids around to get to tutoring or to play sports. They do not have the luxuries that the spoiled Prime Minister has, who has exploited Canadians and made them poorer. That is the difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735634">However, we have a common-sense <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> who knows about hard work and who grew up in arguably the greatest city in the greatest province in this country, Calgary, Alberta. He talks about the common person because he is a common person. He is definitely an extraordinary person, but one who cares about everyday Canadians. That is why, on this side of the House, we have common-sense policies for the common people, the people who built this country and have kept it afloat even though the incompetent Liberal-NDP <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continuously kicks them down with his failed policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735635">Has anyone ever seen so many homeless encampments in the country? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> brags about housing, on which he somehow spent almost $90 billion. The only thing that really went up is the homeless encampments that have popped up around the country. Liberals brag that no one has invested as much in housing as the government has, but what did it get Canadians? It got them more homelessness, more food bank usage and more pain and suffering, but I guess it is all good because all of the people who are suffering are just in a vibecession; it is fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735636">Canada is in an absolute productivity crisis after nine years of the government. We already know how much investment it drove out. We just have to look at the wage gap between a U.S. worker and a Canadian worker, and that gap is widening. In fact U.S. workers are $32,000 better off than Canadian workers. If the incompetent government had just kept pace with former prime minister Stephen Harper, then the gap would not be as wide and Canadian workers would be at least $4,300 richer a year. That would make a huge difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735637">However, the government and its failed policies, supported by the NDP because its <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> really wants his $2-million pension and keeps the incompetent, weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in place, have made Canada's economy worse than Alabama's, which has one of the lowest economies in the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735638"> Canadian household debt is the worst out of all of the G7 countries, but we have to look at why. With an average paycheque, Canadians used to spend about 40% just on housing, but after the government doubled housing costs and the national debt, what did that do? Instead of 40% of a worker's paycheque, now it is 60% to 80% in some cases that goes just to housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735639">As I said before, when we go to the grocery store, we notice the difference. Prices in the U.S. are 37% lower at the grocery store than in Canada. It is all directly because of the carbon tax scam. The Liberals tax the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who ships the food and the grocery store that sells the food. Of course at the end of the day, the Canadians buying the food get hit with the overall cost. That is why it is a scam, nothing more, and why things are so expensive at the grocery store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735640">The government comes up with cheap gimmicks, the lollipops they give just to garner more votes. This is the reality. It is because it knows it cannot on its own record. It has had a failed record over the last nine years; that is why we have the statistics we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735641">If I were to read the statistics about two million Canadians using food banks and one in four Canadians skipping meals, we would not think we were talking about a first world country. We would definitely think we are talking about a third world country. That is what the government has done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735642"> The government keeps talking up a big game, but the member for <Affiliation DbId="278697" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation> talked about muzzling and not being able to speak, and that is ironic. The Toronto Star, of all outlets, published an article entitled “Liberal MP says he was threatened with ‘consequences’ for opposing $250 cheque proposal”. The article says, “Hamilton MP...said earlier this week that he would vote against the government’s cash rebates because they leave out seniors and people with disabilities.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735643"> The article also says, “New Brunswick MP...said she would support the current measure when it comes to a vote, even though she believes it is too restrictive”, and “Newfoundland MP...said he would like to see the cheques expanded to include seniors who receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement, but would support it as is because he does not want to cut off help for Canadians.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735644">According to the article, the <Affiliation DbId="278595" Type="2">St. Catharines</Affiliation> MP, who is a Liberal, “said the benefit should be ‘targeted’, and said the Liberals have already enacted measures to help seniors, such as Ottawa's dental care program, which prioritized [seniors].” He is not in favour of what the government is putting out, yet Liberal MPs are being muzzled.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735650">We will build the homes. Not only will we take the GST off homes built under a million dollars, which will help create 30,000 more new homes and save people on their mortgages and the cost of housing, but we will also incentivize municipalities, the ones that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> keeps shovelling billions of dollars to that end up building more bureaucracy and not more homes. We are going to incentivize them to have 15% more homes built, permits closed, or else we are going to withhold their infrastructure dollars until they meet that target. That is how realtors work. That is how municipalities should work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735651">We are going to fix the budget.

              <ParaText id="8735715">Eliminating the goods and services tax, or GST, on diapers and children's clothing is great and should be made permanent. However, we have serious reservations when the government says it is going to eliminate the GST on champagne and fancy restaurants, where only the rich can afford to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735716">In fact, the proposed measure seems to benefit the rich more than anyone else. As we know, lower-income people pay rent, which is not taxed. At the grocery store, they buy staples, which are already tax-free. That leaves heating, and the government did not want to remove the taxes on heating in this bill. This means that the wealthy are the ones who will save money thanks to the gifts presented here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735717">On top of that, retailers are not happy with the measure because it involves huge costs, thousands and thousands of dollars to make the changes not once, but twice. This is a huge expense for temporary populist measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735718">What is more, the way the government is going about this is unprecedented in the House. It is proposing a measure that will last for only two months and imposing a major gag order. We were only able to review the content of the bill just a few hours before debating it in the House. We were told that we will not be able to amend it or to examine it in committee. That is really unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735719">The government is really out of steam. It is tired and trying anything it can. It is giving people a little pre-election Christmas gift. That is called taking people for fools. When this government took office, it said that it wanted to do things differently. Quite frankly, it has become just as cynical as all of the other governments. This is a petty government. What it is doing is really petty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735720">I will now return to SMEs and small businesses. They are reaching out and telling us that they are worried. The adjustment costs are very high and can amount to several thousand, if not tens of thousands, of dollars per business. Small businesses can never earn that money back through the extra sales they stand to make. They have to check their entire product list, to make sure that products are correctly identified, and then pay their employees overtime wages for that. This involves recalibrating machinery, cash registers, and so on. The technicians needed to perform this work are already scarce, and recalibrating these machines is said to cost about $4,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735721">For the big players, like Walmart, which have to regularly recalibrate their machinery and recheck their prices, this is no big deal. They have the necessary financial means and they can adjust. It is a different story for small businesses, however, and the bill makes no provision for any compensation to help them in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735722">I will give some examples. The owner of a small business that offers accommodation told us he was closing his business for those two months. He calculated the cost of keeping his business open during the holidays and during the two months and he calculated the cost of adapting to the measure. To minimize the losses, the owner decided to close his business that offers accommodation. Also, a bar owner said that he knew that the measure applied to restaurants, but he hoped that bars would be exempt because he really did not feel like going through this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735723">As I was saying, in Quebec, every business, restaurant and bar will have to hire a technician to recalibrate the point of sale machines for January 1, because that is when tip options on the machines will have to be calculated before tax. They will already have to bring in a technician for that, but now they will also have to bring one in on December 14 and on Valentine's Day, two months later. The technician will have to come three times. As I was saying, there is a shortage of technicians. Obviously, the government never thought of that. It never thought about consulting anyone to see how these things work. Such is the government's way. The business owners are going to have to bring in technicians three times. <Sup /><Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735724">That same bar owner said his price for a pint of beer was $7.50. If the government takes the GST off, he is not going to lower his price to $7.22 or $7.15. The price will still be $7.50, and he will pocket the 5%. However, he does not want this to happen at all, because he wants to avoid all the headaches it will cause him. He gave another example. There will be no tax on drinks containing less than 7% alcohol, but drinks containing more than 7% will continue to be taxed. He will have to do an inventory of all his drinks and all his receipts to see what is taxed and what is not. He will have to do all that for an exemption that will last only two months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735725">He also talked about the following big problem. When he makes a bloody caesar, he uses one ounce of vodka and some juice. When he adds a lot of ice, the alcohol content is under 7%, but when he does not use a lot of ice, it will be higher than 7%. He does not know what he should do. He is going to pocket the GST because he does not want to lower his prices. He does not want this measure, because he thinks it is ridiculous and way too much of a hassle. It is unprecedented to go to so much trouble for two months. This government is really tired and on its last legs, so it is willing to try pretty much anything.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735726">I have another example. Children's clothing is fine. The bill says that it must be for children under 14. If someone has a teenager under 14 who is tall and needs adult clothing, they will have to pay the tax because their child is too tall. Obviously the Liberals have thought long and hard about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735727">Other things to mention include all the costs to the provinces. I will start with Quebec. We know that the QST, the Quebec sales tax, is based on the sale price, which has the GST added to it. If there is no GST for two months, the QST would be calculated on a smaller amount. Should Quebec also draft a whole bill to compensate for that loss? Obviously, that is not going to happen. There is going to be a shortfall. I imagine that, in its great wisdom, the federal government called the Quebec government to say that it would compensate for this shortfall, which I estimate at between $30 million and $40 million. No, it did not think of that either. This is a government that writes its bills at the last minute, on the back of a napkin. It is a real mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735728">What is more, as we know, Ottawa pays Revenu Québec to collect GST on Ottawa's behalf. Ottawa gives Revenu Québec money. Given that all of the adjustment costs will be additional costs for Revenu Québec, I would imagine that Ottawa would have acted the gentleman and called Revenu Québec to offer it the necessary compensation before Revenu Québec had to ask, but no, there is nothing about that in the bill either, because the government does not look beyond the end of its tiny nose. We could say that it has a nose as long as Pinocchio's, but when it comes time to think about all of these applications, it does not look beyond the tiny nose of a petty government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735729">Worse still, for the five provinces that have the harmonized sales tax, or HST—Ontario and the four maritime provinces—it is Ottawa that collects the tax. Their tax level is the same as it is for the GST, so everything changes at once, everything is harmonized. With this bill, however, they have discovered that the provincial sales tax, for example in Ontario, will be zero for two months. Understandably, Doug Ford seems to agree with the idea of lowering taxes on beer and was unwilling to lock horns with Ottawa. In provinces like Ontario, where the harmonized tax is 13%, if I am not mistaken, specifically 5% at the federal level and 8% at the provincial level, the province will still have to absorb the bulk of this measure’s cost, which will make it possible for people to buy bottles or cases of champagne to ring in the New Year. As if people who buy champagne really need such a gift. As for the major restaurants, the treasuries of those five provinces will bear the brunt of the cost, again without any consultation. In this particular case, I think that the government was trying to set a trap for the provinces and for the Conservatives, thinking that all this really makes no sense and that the Conservative Premier of Ontario would no doubt refuse to let anyone play around with his finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735730">The government could have said that it wants to lower taxes, but it is the Conservatives who do not. Doug Ford and the provinces that have the HST did not fall into the trap. Now, the government has to play the role of “Grandpa Ottawa” and claim that it is the one in charge of what the provinces do with their tax bases. It is outrageous, but that is what it comes down to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735731">I want to point out something else. I am thinking about all the businesses in the Outaouais and in Gatineau. Consumers will get a 13% tax holiday if they go to Ontario, but only 5% if they go to Quebec. Someone who wants to buy a big video game console tax-free, or a case of champagne, will go shopping in Ontario, which is just great for our retailers, who will have had to pay thousands of dollars to adapt only to see their sales drop, because the Liberals did not think of that either when they drew this up on the back of an envelope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735732">I would have liked to talk about the $250 cheques. They were in the first bill that we were told was going to be introduced, but it was such a mess, and there were so many mistakes in it, that they are left without a dance partner. They are no longer able to find a partner for this ploy to buy votes, which reminds me of the cheques that Stephen Harper sent to families in the summer of 2015; we all saw how that turned out. Most of all, these measures remind me of Maurice Duplessis, who gave fridges to his constituents so that they would vote for him. The government thinks that by giving us cheques and a GST holiday that we will vote for them. Do they take us for fools?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735750"> Madam Speaker, this evening we are debating a bill. As we, Bloc Québécois colleagues, talk to each other about our meetings with constituents in our ridings, we have come to realize that many people are angry about this. Even experts on the economy have said that it is a bad idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735751">In these inflationary times, the Bloc Québécois pointed out that it has long been calling for action to help the most vulnerable get by; it is calling for solutions. However, the devil is in the details, as we say in Quebec. The more we go through the bill, the more we realize that it completely misses the mark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735752">At first, I must confess, even I was naively taken in by this mirage. When I got home last Thursday evening, I thought that I would hear about this measure and that it might make a few people happy. Instead, as soon as I got back to my riding, I learned that constituents were unanimously disappointed. They were not fooled. To add to what was said by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation>, people linked this measure to another one-time cheque mailout. In 2015, the Harper government gave cheques to families; in 2021, the Liberal government did the same. At the time, we could tell that an election was coming. This government sent out cheques to seniors, but only to those aged 75 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735753">I will take the time to talk about seniors. My colleague from Joliette said that he may not have touched on that in his speech. I know that there is nothing about seniors in the bill that we are talking about this evening, but the fact remains that the two subjects were addressed at the same time. I want to mention the fact that seniors will be excluded from the $250 cheques. I will also come back to what could have been done with the $6.3 billion in question and give the government some ideas, in case it does not have any. Finally, I will close by mentioning some other opponents of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735754">First, let us talk about the fact that seniors are unanimously opposed to this. Last weekend, we read the information that was starting to come out about this announcement, and we were shocked to realize that seniors were once again being forgotten. That is right. There will be no cheques for retirees, students, people with disabilities or others who could use the money. However, everyone with a taxable income of up to $150,000 could get an election gift of $250. What a display of cynicism and crass opportunism. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735755">As early as last weekend, I was in contact with seniors' groups. In fact, it all happened quite quickly. It culminated in seniors' groups coming to Parliament Hill today to criticize the fact that they are once again being ignored by the government. Earlier this week, FADOQ spoke out to explain why giving this cheque only to working Canadians is a bad idea. Unfortunately, its members are not the only ones who feel that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735756">I would like make a quick aside. I want to commend my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278398" Type="2">Honoré-Mercier</Affiliation> for reiterating in an interview this morning that this measure is a bad idea. That is coming from a former member of the Liberal government's cabinet, but I digress.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735765">The money could have been spent on increasing old age security pensions. We have been calling for a 10% increase for seniors aged 65 to 74, like the one for seniors aged 75 and up, for more than two years now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735767">On the occasion of the last homelessness day, I read that homelessness was on the rise, including among seniors and students. My measure is less expensive and better targeted. We calculated that Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document> would cost $3 billion. As the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> said in his speech today, the other $3 billion could have been used for housing or to address homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735768">The GST holiday is not a targeted, meaningful measure that will help families get through the inflationary crisis. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> mentioned, there are other measures that would have done more to help families, such as the GST credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735769">The most expensive budget item and biggest worry for families is housing and access to home ownership.

              <ParaText id="8735770">I want to reiterate that $3 billion could go to Bill C‑319 and the other $3 billion could be invested in social and community housing. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278648" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> toured Quebec and wrote a report on housing that sets out a dozen great recommendations for the federal government. I toured Quebec to talk about Bill C-319. There was strong support in Quebec for both of our projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735771">I am not even talking about the funding for the Reaching Home strategy, which should be increased. In fact, Quebec is still waiting for its share so that it can work on the homelessness file. Assistance was promised for cities that are having issues with supervised encampments. They are still waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735772">Third, there are other problems stemming from the GST pause. Last Thursday evening, the chamber of commerce and industry told me that this will cause problems. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> explained it very well. A family services organization called Maison des familles Granby et région said that this is just a band-aid solution that is not going to help vulnerable families in the long term. The executive director wants to have dinner with me soon so we can talk about it. The tourism body Commerce tourisme Granby région warned that there will be issues for businesses, which will have to reprogram cash registers. For example, ATLAS&amp;CO sells children's gifts and holiday products. First of all, not all products in the store will be exempt from GST. What is more, the holiday season is approaching. This is peak season for retailers, but they will be busy reprogramming their registers, all while there is a labour shortage. This is a big problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735773">Then there are the elected municipal officials who got less money than expected from the federal gas tax fund. Municipal infrastructure is needed to help with the housing crisis. The federal government needs to do its part, instead of dumping all the work onto Quebec and the municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735774">I want to make one last point. This debate underscores more than ever the importance of the bill I introduced. The Bloc Québécois is once again calling on the government to give a royal recommendation to the bill that puts an end to having two classes of seniors and increases old age security by 10% for those aged 65 to 74.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735775">According to the OECD, Canada is one of the industrialized countries where people experience the biggest drop in purchasing power when they retire. Clearly, this is a major problem. I do not want the government to tell me that it is too expensive. I do not want it to tell me that it cannot afford it because all the money is tied up in the Trans Mountain pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735776">Basically, we are asking the government to focus on its responsibilities and, above all, its central mission, which is to protect people, especially pensioners aged 65 to 74. The government has deliberately overlooked them once again in favour of priorities that will do nothing to really help families and workers. Let us not forget that social housing and homelessness are crucial issues, not to mention all the harmonization problems between the various provinces and Quebec.</ParaText>

At the end of the day, this legislation would give a GST tax break to Canadians on a wide variety of products. That would be a wonderful thing to take place for two months during the holiday season. I understand the Conservatives have said that they are going to vote against it. Now we have the Bloc that seems to want to put it off and take the risk of Canadians not receiving this tax break during the holiday season.</ParaText>

People talk to me about meaningful measures, like increasing old age security by 10% for seniors aged 65 to 74. Given the current economic uncertainty and the likely return of inflation, it is more important than ever to restore the purchasing power of these seniors. In fact, the Conservatives, and even some Liberals, voted for it, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="278398" Type="2">Honoré-Mercier</Affiliation>.

Currently, drug plans in Quebec leave 15% of Quebeckers behind. The same applies to dental care. Quebeckers are calling for what the NDP is proposing, but the Bloc Québécois says no.

The Conservatives under Harper, with Harper's softwood sellout, lost a billion dollars, basically snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Not only that, but they closed 200 softwood plants across the country. That cost us 100,000 workers. There is a lot of resentment about Harper's softwood sellout and the lost jobs, not only in Prince George but also right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735816">I am sorry, but when the Conservatives start talking about softwood workers, they should give me a break. Their policies were terrible. That was the worse, most corrupt government in Canadian history; it was incompetent in financial management and had many scandals, which were all covered up by the Conservatives. Now they have the audacity to say they took care of forestry workers. They sure did: They threw them out of work. That is not how an NDP government works. We make sure that people get good, unionized jobs. People have the wherewithal to put food on the table and keep a roof over their head.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735817">I want to come back to what the NDP has accomplished. When we look at the bill that we will be voting on tomorrow, it is another example of the NDP putting pressure on the government to get it to actually do the right thing. The government does the wrong thing. It has followed what the Conservatives put into place far too many times, such as the massive overseas tax havens that cost us over $30 billion a year, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, courtesy of the Harper regime and every single Conservative MP. Their constituents cannot thank them for pharmacare, dental care, anti-scab legislation or affordable housing, but they can thank their Conservatives MPs for allowing the richest and most entitled people in Canada, as well as the most profitable corporations, to take over $30 billion in taxpayer money offshore every year. That is thanks to the Harper regime. Its most notable achievement was to hollow out and gut the federal budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735818">It is because of those things that we have the current motion before us tonight. We simply cannot ever trust Conservatives to do the right thing. We cannot always trust the Liberals to do the right thing either, but when they accept NDP leadership, they do end up doing the right thing. As far as Conservatives are concerned, Conservatives simply do not. That is why we need a motion that actually gets us through all the gates and obstacles, so we can get this GST relief to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735819">Colleagues will recall, of course, that it was the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> who called for this, who said we needed to take the GST off family essentials. The NDP members think differently from the Liberals and the Conservatives, who are always just paying lip service. In the case of the Conservatives, they are badly damaging the country every time they get the reins of power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735820">The NDP called for taking the GST off all essentials. That includes the cellphones that we use, which are an essential service. We pay far too much for our cellphone bills. We are being gouged in this country. We also want to take the GST off home heating, children's clothing and a variety of other essentials. The government has done part of that, but certainly not all of it. We believe that, this Christmas season, we have a responsibility as parliamentarians to step up and actually get the GST relief adopted. Now, Conservatives do not feel that way. They prefer to be imposters. They would love never to do anything to help anybody. That is their modus operandi: They come into the House and pontificate but never accomplish a damn thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735839">Madam Speaker, my goodness, the Conservatives are a sensitive group. They are just so sensitive to criticism. They are sensitive about their record and sensitive to criticism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735840">Let us continue the comparison. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, in 20 years, has accomplished one singular accomplishment: He managed, as housing minister, to build six homes. That is great. However, the Conservatives are right to point out that the housing prices have doubled under the Liberals, and they are right to point out that the food bank lineups, as tragic as they are, have doubled in size. What Conservatives will not admit is that the same thing happened under the Harper regime. Housing prices doubled under Harper, and the Conservatives have never admitted to that. They have never apologized for their role in that. Of course, as well, we know that food bank lineups doubled during the Harper regime. What Canadians are living through is half the responsibility of the Conservatives and half the responsibility of the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735841">Now, the Liberals, to their credit, will accept NDP leadership, and we get things done, such as dental care and pharmacare. We finally having investments in affordable housing. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> thought it was cool to build six homes in his long tenure as minister of housing. The Liberals now have the wherewithal, because of the NDP pressure in the last budget, to build hundreds of thousands of homes over the next few years, and we take full credit for having made that advantage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735842">When we look at the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, we see there were six homes built in 20 years. Now, let us look at what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> has accomplished just in the last 20 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735843"> In the last 20 weeks, we have this GST relief, which we will be voting on tomorrow, that would take the GST off of family essentials. The GST, I have to mention, is a Conservative tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735844">Conservative MPs can thank New Democrats for working on behalf of their constituents, but they will not, because Conservatives do not do that. They do not thank us. Each one of the MPs who are in the House has 3,000 constituents who are getting dental care. They have dental care because of the NDP, but I have never had a conservative MP come up and say, “Thank you, NDP, for fighting so hard for my constituents.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735845"> For the GST, it would be similar. We are going to make sure that Conservatives' constituents are taken care of. We are going to take the Conservative GST off of family essentials, and that is going to make a difference. Does it go as far as the NDP would go? No, we would include home heating. We would include telecom, where we pay far too much, to ensure that Canadians have that, and we would make this permanent. However, we are not going to block a bill when we know that it would benefit Canadians right across the country. We are going to make sure that the bill gets through, and that is why we are coming back to this motion so that we can actually get it through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735846">If we ask Conservatives to do anything, they never will. It will take them years and years. They will offer a ton of excuses, but they will never get things done on behalf of their constituents. Their modus operandi is to make things as bad as possible. They certainly succeeded in the Harper regime in doubling housing prices and food bank lineups, and now the Liberals, unfortunately, saw that as an example and did the same thing. The reality is, in this corner of the House with the NDP, we actually believe in doing things that will benefit people, which is why we are going to be supporting the bill, and making sure that it is implemented tomorrow night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735847"> Let us come back to this comparison. On the one hand, we have the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, with 20 years and a fat pension. My goodness, it is a $20-million pension. The fattest pension in Parliament is for the member of Carleton. It is just a big, fat pension. Of course, in the 20 years it took to earn that pension, he built six houses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735848">Now, let us look at the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> over the last 20 weeks. A million Canadians have dental care because of the work done by the member for Burnaby South and the members of the NDP caucus over the last 20 weeks. In the last 20 weeks, we also got the pharmacare bill through the House and through the Senate. In just a matter of a few days, we are going to have agreements with provinces to start the flow of that medication. That means that everybody with diabetes, and there are four million people with diabetes in this country, will have their diabetes medication covered. Some of them are now paying $1,000 or $1,500 every month for their diabetes medication. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735849">Constituents, like my constituent, Amber, paying $1,000 a month for her diabetes medication, will have that crushing financial burden taken off their shoulders. That is an important fundamental shift in how we treat health care and expand health care for four million Canadians. Provinces are signing on and have already expressed interest, except for Conservative provinces, which I will come back to in a moment. When they sign, what we will see is a fundamental relief in that crushing financial burden that comes from diabetes, and many families looking for contraception will not have to struggle to see whether they have enough money to pay for their contraception and family planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735850"> I will come back to the Conservative provinces. We have a couple of provinces that have the worst health outcomes in the country and they are Conservative. When we look at Conservative provinces, we see the highest crime rate and we see the poorest health outcomes. Those two are connected. Conservatives will say, “We are never going to sign on to pharmacare.” However, the reality is we saw the same opposition by Conservative provinces to universal health care, one of Canada's proudest achievements. In fact, when we ask Canadians what institution they admire most, they say it is universal health care in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735851"> Tommy Douglas, the first leader of the NDP, was the founder of universal health care in this country and always believed that pharmacare was the next step. However, when we got universal health care through this House at that time, the Conservative provinces opposed it. What happened? First, the provinces that signed on saw how universal health care was a benefit and some of the Conservative provinces' leaders suddenly realized they had a political problem if they did not sign on, so they actually had the foresight to sign on to universal health care. There were some Conservative provinces that did not, run by very stubborn Conservative leaders who did not really care about their populations at all. What happened, and this is why it took three years to fully implement universal health care, is that those Conservative leaders were defeated. Their population said, “hell no; we are not going to allow this Conservative extremist to block our universal health care.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735852"> I predict that the same thing will happen with universal pharmacare and what we are going to see is Canadians demanding pharmacare as the provinces sign on and people get the benefit. Why should somebody with diabetes in Alberta have to pay and pay, when in British Columbia, which has a progressive NDP government that is signing on to universal pharmacare, that person has their diabetes medication and devices covered?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735853">When we look at the accomplishments of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> over the last 20 weeks, which include things like anti-scab legislation, affordable housing, dental care, pharmacare and I could go on and on, we can see that the member for Burnaby South has done 10 times more, if not 20 times more, than the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation> with his fat pension has done in 20 years. That is the comparison that people are going to see when we have our election in 2025. We know it is scheduled then, and that is when Canadians will make that comparison. Do we go with somebody who is all hot air, or do we go with somebody who has actually done things for us? I do caution Conservative MPs who have had 3,000 or 3,500 constituents in their ridings who already benefit from the NDP dental care plan. They might have to think a bit, when they are campaigning, about how they explain why they have opposed something that has benefited so many of their constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735854">The final thing that I want to mention is the issue that the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation> has raised. I think he said that it is a “trick”. He likes to say that. He likes to say that programs do not exist. It is very Trumpian. It is sort of saying, “I am just going to pretend that there is a different reality”, with respect to dental care, for example. However, the reality is that there is a former Conservative leader who called for exactly this type of program of Christmas temporary GST relief. That was Erin O'Toole, and there is video on that, so I would encourage my Conservative colleagues to actually watch and educate themselves and see Erin O'Toole calling for exactly the same thing that the NDP is bringing to the House tonight.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="30">(2030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8735855">The proposed GST relief on essentials would make a difference right across the country. The NDP would do it better and do it differently, but we are not going to stand in the way of something that is going to benefit people. It is for that reason we will be supporting the bill and supporting the motion tonight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8735856">I am going to sit down now. I am going to be contacting my chair, and I just want to assure Conservatives that when I contact my chair, I am not going to change my mind and pretend I should still speak, or try to play some games. I am just going to sit down—</ParaText>

Fortunately, between the Liberals and the New Democrats, we were able to come up with legislation. One of the fears I have is that a future Conservative government would get rid of the pharmacare program, when in fact we should be looking at ways we can expand it, to include things like shingles, for example. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8735862">Madam Speaker, I would like to start off by saying the Liberals were not passionate about pharmacare when, three and a half years ago, they stood in the House and voted down the NDP's bill on the Canadian pharmacare act.

              <ParaText id="8735863">I am glad that three and a half years later we have put in place the rudiments of pharmacare. It is going to help people with diabetes and contraception, but yes, absolutely, we need to move beyond that to all classes of drugs. This is a no-brainer. It would save $4 billion for Canadians and save hundreds of lives every year. </ParaText>
