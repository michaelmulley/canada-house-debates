              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558716">He said: Mr. Speaker, Canada made us all a promise. That promise was that anyone from anywhere could do anything. My parents taught me that. They are teachers, after all. They taught me a lot of things. I was adopted by these two teachers because I was born to a 16-year-old single mom who could not raise me at that time. My parents taught me that despite my humble beginnings, I could get where I wanted if I was willing to work hard. The promise was kept by our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558717">Canada made that same promise to my wife when she came here as a refugee from Venezuela when she was a little girl. All six members of her family lived in a cramped two-bedroom basement apartment in east Montreal. Her dad would get up early in the morning to pick fruit. Later on, he would get up at four in the morning to work in the banking sector. Today, we can safely say that the family has succeeded. My wife Anaida has one brother who is a soldier and another who is a carpenter. Her sister is a nurse. The promise of Canada was kept for her family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558718">That is why I got into politics in the first place. When I was elected, I was part of a government that expanded that promise by lowering inflation, the GST, income taxes and taxes on small businesses. We also balanced the budget, and we did it all while increasing health transfers faster than any government in the history of health transfers. Personal incomes went up 10% after we lowered inflation and income taxes. We made the promise even more achievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558719">Now, however, after nine years of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the promise of Canada has been broken. He has broken a lot of promises. He promised to balance the budget, to reduce taxes on the middle class, and to build more affordable housing, but all of those promises were broken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558720">What is different about this promise I am talking about is that it was not the Prime Minister who made it. It does not come from him. This is a promise made to every Canadian, whether they were born here or immigrated to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558721"> It makes us so sad these days to see hard-working young Canadians who are 35 and living in their parents' basements. This never used to happen before this Prime Minister came along with his policies that doubled housing costs. Every month, 2,000 people line up at food banks. There are 1,800 homeless encampments across Ontario. This has never been seen before. This is the type of thing we see in third-world countries. People are dying in these encampments. Gun violence is up 120% since this Prime Minister, with the help of the Bloc Québécois, went after hunters while letting criminals and gun smugglers go free. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558722">We need to talk about what the Bloc Québécois is doing. The Bloc Québécois is helping the current government. It voted 188 times to keep the Prime Minister in power and supported $500 billion in inflationary, bureaucratic and centralizing spending. I would add that money for health care and seniors was not part of that $500 billion, not part of that spending, because it is already set out in legislation. There was no need to vote to keep it. What I am talking about is spending on consultants, bureaucrats, interest groups, and big government-subsidized corporations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558723">At the same time, the Bloc Québécois is voting to increase the fuel tax, including in Quebec with carbon tax 2, which does apply in Quebec, and the capital gains tax, which will force Quebec farmers, entrepreneurs, doctors and home builders to pay Ottawa more money that will be controlled by the federal government. Even the Bloc Québécois's current demands will result in an expansion of the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558724"> It is true that I was part of a government that increased health transfers, but I am not a separatist. The Bloc Québécois says that, in order to fund health care, we need to send more of Quebeckers' money to Ottawa, which will send it back to Quebec. The Bloc wants the federal government to have even more control over Quebeckers' health. At the same time, it recognizes that Quebeckers need the federal programs, which goes against its goal of creating a sovereign state. There is an internal contradiction within the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558725"> Now, the Bloc Québécois wants to keep the most centralizing and costly <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in history in power, a Prime Minister whose immigration policy is out of control, according to his own <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation>. That policy has pushed Quebec to the breaking point. The Bloc Québécois says to wait, but waiting never changes anything. The Bloc Québécois is telling Quebeckers to wait, when Quebeckers cannot get health care or social services or buy a house, when Quebeckers see an economy in which the GDP per capita is lower than it was 10 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558726"> The Bloc Québécois says that it does not know what I am going to do. My immigration policy is very clear. Everyone has seen it. I was a member of the party in power, and we will adopt exactly the same approach to immigration as we did 10 years ago. We gave the provinces a lot of power but maintained control of the numbers. We allowed people to come to Canada and meet our labour needs in sectors experiencing shortages, but in numbers that our labour market, housing market and health care system could handle. That is the approach I adopted when our party was in power, and that is the approach I will adopt in the future. I have already explained my policy in a lot more detail than the other opposition leaders. The <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> has said nothing about most of the major issues. I will be even clearer on the campaign trail, when I will outline my common-sense plan to axe the tax, fix the budget, build the homes and stop the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558727">We will axe the tax to make work pay off again, so that servers, truck drivers and plumbers who work more earn more and bring home powerful paycheques. For that to happen, though, people need a roof over their heads. Currently, Canada has fewer homes per capita than any other G7 country. There is too much red tape. I am going to incentivize municipalities to speed up building permits, cut building taxes and free up land for building, while axing the tax that stands in the way of construction, so that young people still have a chance of getting a home. We will cap population growth so that the housing stock grows faster than the population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558728">We will fix the budget with a law that requires the government to find one dollar of savings for every new dollar of spending. This is how single moms, seniors and small businesses balance their budgets, and they expect us to adopt the same common-sense approach. We will cut the use of consultants, something the Bloc voted to fund. We will cut bureaucracy, waste and big handouts to multinational corporations that are offshoring our money. We will cut all that to bring the money home so we can lower deficits, inflation and interest rates and fund our social services. We will stop the crime not by banning hunting rifles, as the Bloc and the Liberals want to do, but by being tough on criminals and strengthening the border.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558729">By doing this, we will bring home a country where hard work earns a more powerful paycheque that buys affordable food, gas and homes in safe communities, where anyone from anywhere can do anything through hard work. That is the promise of Canada, and that is what we will bring home.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8558730"> This country made me a promise when I was born. It made the same promise to everyone in this room and across this country. I was born to a 16-year-old single mom who put me up for adoption to two school teachers, who taught me about this promise. The promise was that anyone from anywhere could do anything. That hard work would earn one a powerful paycheque. It would buy one good food and a decent home in a safe neighbourhood. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558731">It is that promise that brought my wife's family here as refugees from Venezuela. There were six people in a two-bedroom, basement, working-class, Montreal apartment. Her dad was up at the crack of dawn to hop in the back of a pickup truck to go out into the middle of a farm field and pick fruits so he could pay the rent. Today, her brothers are a soldier and a carpenter. Her sister is a nurse. Her father has a business with his wife. They have all succeeded. The promise was kept. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558732">It was that promise that got me into politics in the first place. I was very proud to be part of a government that not only kept the promise, but expanded it with the lowest inflation in almost half a century. Incomes after tax and inflation went up 10%. We cut the GST. We balanced the budget. We did it all while increasing health care transfers faster than any government since that time. That is why I welcome every single time they talk about my experience in government. I would like to do the exact same thing in the future, which is to expand the opportunity, expand the promise of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558733">However, after nine years of the NDP-Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that promise has been broken. Everything costs more. Two million people are lined up at food banks because they cannot afford food. This is a record-smashing number. One in 10 Torontonians now go to a food bank every single month. Housing costs have doubled and two-thirds of young people believe they will never be able to afford a home. That has never happened in Canadian history. We see it most tragically on our streets, where there are now 1,800 homeless encampments across Ontario, and there are 35 in quaint, beautiful, once prosperous Halifax. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has admitted in his own press releases that one in four kids are not getting enough food. Linked to this, malnutrition and diseases, which had long ago been eradicated, are making a comeback. We have lost 47,000 people to drug overdoses, more than we lost in the Second World War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558734"> These numbers are stories. They are human lives. When the NDP says that all these people can wait, that we do not need to fix these problems now, but just delay another year and let thousands more die, let thousands more lose their homes and move into dangerous tent encampments, thousands more become addicted to government-funded drugs or get killed by a rampant career criminal who was released once again for the 76th time to unleash chaos in our streets. New Democrats tell those Canadians who are suffering the pain of a brutal economy to wait. It is the worst economy since the Great Depression. The GDP per capita, which is the income per person, is down more than at any time since the Great Depression. In fact, our economy per capita is smaller today than it was 10 years ago. Our income per person has dropped more than any other G7 country since 2019, the year before the pandemic, while the American economy has grown 19%, right next door.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558735">The gap between our per capita GDP and that of the Americans is now worse than at any time since at least World War II, and according to one Liberal economist, Trevor Tombe, the worst in a century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558736"> We have gone from winning the tug-of-war on capitalism with the Americans, where they were investing $30 billion to $100 billion more per year in our economy than we were investing in theirs in the first 14 years of this century, to $450 billion more Canadian money invested in the States than the reverse in the last nine years. Canadian dollars are building pipelines, mines, business centres, shopping centres and businesses that pay American paycheques. I love America, but I do not want to bring jobs to Americans. I want to bring home those jobs and the Canadian promise to this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558737">That is why we have a common-sense plan to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. This will be a carbon tax referendum and a carbon tax election. I know that the media has worked hard to try to avoid me saying the words “carbon tax”, as we saw in the extremely dishonest and fraudulent report from Bell Media-controlled CTV, a company whose bonds have been downgraded to near-junk status as its overpaid CEO empties the books to pay his wealthy friends an unacceptably and unrealistically high dividend.

              <ParaText id="8558789">Madam Speaker, no, and what I also do not plan to do is cut health care the way the Liberals did in the preceding years, prior to Conservatives coming in and rebuilding the public health care system. They slashed health care by $20 billion. We increased it by 70% to heal the pain and damage. Furthermore, I will bring in a blue seal standard so that our brilliant 20,000 immigrant doctors and 32,000 immigrant nurses can get licensed, get to work and reduce waiting lists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558790">Finally, I will reject the radical plan for a “single-payer” drug plan, which is right in the law. By definition, that means all private plans must be banned under the Liberal-NDP agenda, which they lay out in their wording in their pharmacare bill. They want to keep Canadians from having a private drug plan with the hope and the promise that, one day, they might get a government plan like the government housing plan, which doubled their housing costs; the school food program, which has not delivered a single meal in two years; or the gun plan, which spent $67 million without recovering a single gun. These people cannot be trusted to run a lemonade stand, let alone a drug plan. I will protect Canadians' right to have a private drug plan so that they have the medication they need when they go to the drug store.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8558791"> Madam Speaker, today, we are here to discuss confidence in the government. It is a matter that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has put forward. However, what he said just now was full of things that are simply not true. He stated that he is proud of Canada, but he spent the past 20 minutes talking about all the things that he does not like about Canada and about Canadians. All he does is talk about how this country is broken. It is a shame that he wants to put forward a vision that does not put Canadians at the heart of what our government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558792">Today, I am here to talk about the fact that, for the past nine years, the government has put Canadians first. We have always had Canadians at the core of everything we do. That is what we will continue to do throughout this minority parliament and, I hope, in the future. However, I want to start with a story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558793"> This Sunday, I was in my community in Burlington, at the Appleby Line Street Festival. I had a number of constituents come up to me, but one who resonated with me in particular was a young mom in her early 30s. She said she needed to thank me for the national child care plan that we put in place because that plan has made a huge difference in her family's life. Her husband, unfortunately, had lost his job for whatever reason. The fact of the matter was that our putting in that child care has meant that he has been able to go back to school and train, and they have been able to afford their child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558794">Stories such as these make a difference in people's lives. What we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> just now is that he has every intention of undoing the important work that we did. When we think about the fact that over 100,000 women in Ontario alone rejoined the workforce because of that child care plan, that is something that the Leader of the Opposition wants to undo. The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader </Affiliation>of the NDP asked him point-blank if he would cut the dental care plan, a plan that 750,000 Canadian seniors and children have now taken advantage of. He refused to answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558795"> When the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was talking about pharmacare, he was misleading Canadians when he stated that they would not be able to access the high-quality drugs that they need and that there would not be a private plan that they could potentially use. What he neglected to mention is that the initial part of this plan is to make diabetes medication and contraceptives free. One thing we need to ask ourselves is why the Leader of the Opposition is against that. Why is he against making contraceptives free for Canadian women? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558796">We know that many members in the party opposite are opposed to the reproductive and health care rights of women in this country. We need to ask the opposition why they do not want to make contraceptives free. We know they have a hidden agenda. They are against women accessing the health care and reproductive care that they need. This is one example of how they intend to make it harder for women to access and utilize their reproductive rights in this country. That is something we should all be concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558797">Let us talk about the economy. We know that Canadians have been going through tough economic times. Global headwinds have had an impact on Canadians, just as they have on people around the world. However, the current government has stood up for the Canadian economy in the most important ways. It has done this not once, but twice. When it came to renegotiating NAFTA, when we faced an American president who decided that their main objective was to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, what did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the then foreign minister, who is now our <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, do? They stood up to Americans; not only did they renegotiate NAFTA, but they also made an even better NAFTA for Canadians. What did the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and his Conservative colleagues suggest we do from day one? It was to capitulate, sign whatever we could and give away the kitchen sink. That is how the Conservatives act, but we stood up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8558798">When it came to steel and aluminum tariffs, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> talked about being on the floor of Stelco. I was at Stelco when we announced that the steel and aluminum tariffs were lifted. It was the current government that did that. It is the current government that has protected steelworkers, has protected the Canadian economy and has led to Canada's having the third-highest foreign direct investment in the OECD, because that is something that we care about: creating good jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558799">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> talks about not wanting to give Canadian jobs to Americans, but what did the Conservatives do when it came to General Motors? In order to balance the budget, they sold our shares in General Motors.</ParaText>

                <B>Hon. Karina Gould:</B> Madam Speaker, it was at a loss; that is right, but it was the current government that made sure those GM jobs stayed in Canada. It was the current government that made sure the auto sector has the supports it needs to advance in the 21st century. We believe in fighting climate change and we believe in low-emission vehicles, and we are seeing record investment in the Canadian auto sector, not just in Ontario and Quebec but right across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558802">What do the Conservatives think? They want to get rid of all of this and forget about it. They call it corporate social welfare. Guess what, those are thousands and thousands of direct jobs that Canadians rely on to pay their bills, to send their kids to after-school activities and to make sure they have a good quality of life, and the Conservatives want to rip all of that up. However, we will continue to fight for Canadians and for good jobs in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558803">I will talk about the second time we stood up for the Canadian economy, a time that most of us would like to forget about because it was when COVID-19 came to our doors and hit us hard in Canada, just like it hit everyone hard around the world. What did we do? We said we would be there to support Canadians. Whether that was with the Canada emergency business account, the Canada emergency wage subsidy or direct payments to Canadians through CERB to ensure that they could make ends meet, we were there for Canadians every step of the way. We ensured that when it was time, when it was safe to do so, we could restart the Canadian economy; it would turn back on and Canadians could get back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558804">What did the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> say? He said he would not have provided any of those supports. He derided them. He said that putting government money into supporting people was a bad thing. He called that “big government”. On this side of the House, we believe that the government is there to help people. It is there to help Canadians. We do not believe, like the Conservatives opposite, that Canadians should be left to their own devices, to fend for themselves and be left on their own in times of need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558805"> We have been there for Canadians when times were tough, and we will be there for Canadians throughout the recovery. We will be there to make sure they have what they need in order to succeed. That is exactly what we do on this side of the House, and that is exactly—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8558810">It is extremely important for us. It is important for the government to ensure that Canadians know that everything we do is for them. It is a very different approach from what the Conservatives are proposing. We are here to stand up for Canadians' rights and economic opportunities, to defend our country and the Canadian economy, while the Conservatives do not want to defend them. They told the U.S. that in the event of a pandemic, they would do nothing. They will not be there to defend Canadians. That is extremely important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558811">It is really important to Canadians to ensure that we have access to good information. During his speech, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> once again said that he wants to destroy this country's media ecosystem. He said he does not want to give money to CBC/Radio-Canada. CBC/Radio-Canada is not perfect, but it is part of our history as Canadians, and it ensures that Canadians across the country, whether they are on the west coast, the east coast, in the north or in rural areas, whether they are anglophone or francophone, have access to the news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558812">We know why the Conservatives do not want that. When Canadians are well informed, they do not support the Conservatives. The Conservatives have a hidden agenda. They do not want Canadians to know what they will do if they come to power. Look at what happened with support for doctors. They do not want Canadians to have access to contraceptives. They do not want women's reproductive rights to be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558813">These are very important questions that Canadians might well ask Conservatives, but we all know how Conservatives are with the media. What does the opposition leader do when people ask him tough questions? He attacks the media. Attacks on the media are attacks on Canadians, because the media asks questions on behalf of Canadians. If he truly respected Canadians and this country, he would not attack the people asking those questions on behalf of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8558851">Madam Speaker, to begin, I would like to note that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558852">In 2021, the people made a choice. Canadians and Quebeckers chose a minority government. It was simply a renewal of what was in place between 2019 and 2021. I was leader at the time, and I can say that things were going well. For two years, we negotiated and discussed. Despite COVID‑19, I thought we worked well together and our approach succeeded in improving life for Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558853">Then, the NDP and the Liberals cobbled together a majority with no respect for what had happened during the election. That is when the attacks on Quebec and on provincial jurisdictions began. For the first time in history, excessive centralization became a fact of life. Despite its difficulty in managing its own responsibilities, this government started poking its nose into the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces. In the meantime, the NDP were doing cartwheels, wild with delight, claiming that it was the right thing to do considering the NDP's dream of seeing the provinces disappear. The New Democrats, as Mr. Duceppe once said, are just Liberals in a hurry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558854">Now, the situation has revolved back to the one we anticipated during the 2021 election, a minority government. One thing is very strange, however. The NDP, self-proclaimed champions of the environment, forged ties with a government that spent $83 billion on dirty oil from western Canada. The NDP supported that government. Someone will have to explain that to me, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558855">Let us return to the topic at hand. For three weeks now, the government has found itself in a true minority status. The Bloc Québécois will try to increase its influence over this government. The Bloc will try to negotiate in an effort to make things better for Quebeckers. What is good for Quebec is good for the Bloc Québécois. That is what we believed, and we have been shouting it from the rooftops.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558856">There is a list of things we would like to accomplish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558857">First, there is Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>, which will definitively put an end to this government's discriminatory treatment of seniors between the ages of 65 and 74.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558858">Another priority of ours is to ensure that the bill on quotas receives royal assent so that protection is built into international agreements. There are 6,000 Quebec businesses and 100,000 workers that depend on this bill in part. We will work to finally get that bill passed and implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558859">Another important issue is distribution of asylum seekers. The government, which finally issued its <I>mea culpa</I>, must offer a solution that allows Quebeckers to catch their breath. It must enhance the services offered to all Quebeckers and to newcomers as well, so that they receive better service from this government. That is the position of the Bloc Québécois</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558860">Now we have this Conservative motion is before us. The Conservatives say that it is the best new thing since sliced bread, but at some point we will all have to wake up and realize that this motion, which arrived in week two of this session and in week three of this newly minority government, has come upon us awfully fast. We in the Bloc could choose to trigger elections. In an upset last week we captured a stronghold riding, LaSalle—Émard—Verdun. We have the wind in our sails, and that is the truth. We have been at the top of the polls for some time now. We are potentially in a position to make gains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558861">Like excited poodles hearing their owner come home, we could pull the trigger on elections. The reason we in the Bloc Québécois are exercising restraint is that our goal is not to improve our own situation. Although our members, candidates and apparatus are all ready, we are here for Quebeckers. Our work is to do what is best for them at this time, and that happens to be establishing a dialogue with a minority government, which has to reach agreements with the various opposition parties. Obviously, there is no agreement possible with the Conservative Party, so that leaves the NDP and the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558862">That is one of the reasons why we will be voting against this motion. The second reason is that there will be plenty of non-confidence votes between now and Christmas, and we see no need to hit the ground running. We will have plenty of opportunities. What we are saying is that we should give them a chance. And by “them”, we mean the Liberals. They take their sweet time on occasion, but we are going to give them a chance to show us they can earn our confidence, or, more precisely, Quebeckers' confidence. Needless to say, this is a limited-time offer. As I was saying, this government has one year left, at most. That, then, is the second reason why we will be voting against this motion. To recap, the first reason is that we want to make gains for Quebec and the second is that there is no rush; there will be other votes between now and Christmas. According to our calculations, there will be five to seven votes following this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558863">There is a third reason why we will be voting against this motion. We are watching the Conservatives talk and we are not exactly convinced we want to see them take power that quickly. When we hear the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, a compulsive sloganeer if there ever was one—I mean, he spits out slogans like there is no tomorrow—we see that he basically says nothing. He offers no solutions, only slogans. We do not find this reassuring. When we listen to him speak and ask the Conservatives whether they have a plan for Quebec, their answer is no, they do not have a plan for Quebec. As far as they are concerned, Quebeckers are Canadians, and if Canadians find reasons to vote for them, Quebeckers will too. Does the idea of a distinct society ring a bell with them? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558864">In some cases our position in Quebec differs from Canada's. There is a reason the Bloc Québécois is here. The Conservatives say it is no big deal that they are not doing anything special for Quebec. I asked the Conservatives' Quebec lieutenant if the Conservatives had a plan. He seemed taken aback by the idea of having a plan. Ten seconds later, he woke up and I heard him say with a straight face: There is no plan for Quebec, what is good for Canadians is good for Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558865">We might wonder what the Quebec lieutenant is good for. What a useless role that is, being the Conservatives' Quebec lieutenant, honestly. When people want to know what the Conservatives' position is on Quebec, that is no way to handle it. The slogan king is going to start to say just about anything. It is time to limit discussions: simple question, simple answer. Otherwise, everyone gets mixed up. Even his Quebec MPs are often confused because they would like him to say things about Quebec, but the things he says are never good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558866">The Conservative leader just told us that they are not centralists like the Liberals. In the same breath, he says that mayors are idiots and that he is going to cut housing funds unless they do things the Conservatives' way. However, they claim they are not centralists. What else could it be called? They say they are not centralists, but they support the third link in Quebec City. If Quebeckers want a tramway instead, they will not get a cent from the federal government. A large part of the federal government's money, however, comes from Quebec. In that case, it should be returned to Quebeckers. But no, the Conservatives do not believe in public transit. They prefer a third link, but they are not centralists, not a bit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558867"> The Act respecting the laicity of the State is universally supported in Quebec. There are some Quebecker who are against secularism, but almost all of them say that it is up to Quebeckers to decide and that the federal government should mind its own business. Instead, here is what the federal government is doing: It is using tax dollars collected from Quebeckers to hire lawyers to take the Government of Quebec to court over this law. When we tell the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> that he should oppose the government challenging a law that was democratically passed by the Quebec National Assembly, his response is that he, too, would challenge that law. What then is the difference between the Liberals and the Conservatives?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558868">Let us talk a bit about health transfers. Quebec has made request after request. The Liberal government put together an agreement that really upset Quebeckers. They were going ballistic and coming to blows on buses. One would think maybe the Conservatives would do better, but no. They are saying that they think that the health agreement is fine the way it is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8558893">Madam Speaker, the Bloc Québécois is thrilled to see that the NDP-Liberal coalition appears to have come to an end. The people elected a minority government in 2019 and did not give anyone a blank cheque in 2021. The Bloc Québécois has a lot of weight when it comes to promoting Quebec's priorities and interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558894"> With the NDP-Liberal alliance, we again found ourselves with a government that completely ignores Quebec, its needs, its priorities and the consensuses reached by the National Assembly. There has been a growing centralization of decision-making power and, as a result, Canadians are deciding what is done in Quebec. There has also been a repeated rejection of Quebec's positions as expressed in unanimous resolutions in our National Assembly. Normally, when the National Assembly is unanimous, there is nothing more to be said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558895">I will start with a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558896"> There are the infrastructure programs. Quebec has requested the federal government to transfer the amounts unconditionally, since this is not federal infrastructure and Quebec must be free to manage its own land as it sees fit. The federal government has ignored this request. Worse yet, they added insult to injury by creating a federal department in charge of provincial infrastructure and municipalities. Even the Leader of the Opposition tried to get tough on municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558897">There are the housing programs. Quebec asked that Ottawa respect its jurisdiction and simply help improve its programs. Not only did the Liberal-NDP alliance ignore that, but Quebec got burned and received less than its share of the money spent on new federal programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558898">Quebec has repeatedly rejected federal interference through a myriad of unanimous resolutions. Every one of them has been ignored by the federal government, which continues to increase the number of federal strategies in areas that are not under its jurisdiction. Take, for example, the labour force, federal strategies addressing various aspects of health care, and the rejection of Quebec's consensus on advance requests for MAID. As the critic for seniors, I hear a lot about this last point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558899">Then we have the inadequate transfers to Quebec, which are not increasing quickly enough to meet the population's needs. This results in overcrowded classrooms and a health care system that is close to its breaking point. More substantial health transfers are urgently needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558900">There again, they developed a whole range of federal programs in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction with money that should have been used to properly fund Quebec's essential programs. I will give an example. Last June, we criticized the age well at home initiative, a program launched by the federal government through the back door during its last campaign in Quebec. Lastly, Quebec groups do not have the money they should have. The Quebec minister responsible for seniors is asking that the funds be transferred. She has a home care plan but no, the federal government wants to set conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558901"> All this is happing while the federal government, which barely provides Canadians with any services, managed to find the funding to hire 109,000 additional federal public servants whose main duty appears to be to tell Quebeckers what to do. In committee, I asked why we were outsourcing more. I did not get an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558902"> The fiscal and environmental policy is largely focused on the needs of western Canada, with $83 billion in tax credits to the oil companies, plus $34 billion of our money pumped into the Trans Mountain pipeline. I will get back to this later. I would like people to stop telling me that we do not have enough money to implement Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558903"> Second, there have been changes in the House. The constituents of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun did well by Quebec last week by electing the Bloc Québécois candidate, adding to Quebec's voice and its political weight. I hope that we will be able to welcome our 33rd member of the Bloc Québécois soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558904"> The Bloc Québécois wants to know whether the government has taken note of this change and whether there will be a realignment that will allow Quebeckers to get something from the government soon. Only then will we be able to determine whether the government should fall or whether it should be given a little more time to fix its mistakes and take our priorities into account. We want more for Quebec. Rather than blindly opposing or supporting the Liberal or Conservative parties, the Bloc Québécois wants to move forward with issues that Quebeckers care about. If it is good for Quebec, we will support it. If it is not good for Quebec, we will reject it. This is nothing new; it is not a surprise. We have always been very clear where we stand. It is not as if we woke up one morning and decided on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558905">In 2021, our campaign slogan was simply “Québécois”, or “Quebeckers”, to make it clear that, for us, only Quebec matters. In 2019, it was “Le Québec, c’est nous”, or “We are Quebec”, to indicate that we were the ones who would carry the Quebec consensus. In 2015, it was “On a tout à gagner”, or “We have everything to gain”, to make it clear that the Bloc Québécois was going to work to make Quebec win in Ottawa and achieve gains for Quebec. Today we are giving this government one last chance to earn our trust, to take immediate action for Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558906">Fourth, let us talk about priorities. As a first step, we are calling on the new minority government to give royal recommendation to Bill C-319, which would put an end to the two classes of seniors and increase old age security by 10% for seniors between the ages of 65 and 74.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558907">Old age security is one of the rare truly federal social programs. While the federal government meddles in many things, it has neglected its primary responsibilities. We want to give the government a chance to realign itself, assume its basic responsibilities and enable seniors to live a decent life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558908">According to the OECD, Canada is one the industrialized nations where the population faces the greatest decline in purchasing power on retirement. We could do much better. I do not want to hear that it costs too much. It would cost $3 billion a year. That represents 0.57% of government spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558909">Earlier, my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278653" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation> aptly said that it is not the cost that is stopping the government; it just has other priorities. There is the $34 billion to buy and build the Trans Mountain pipeline and the $83 billion in tax gifts to the oil companies. Do they really need it? The government paid $2 billion to Sun Life, a private company, to run the federal dental insurance plan when this could have been done for free with a transfer to Quebec. It is an area under Quebec's responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558910">We are asking the government, which is now a minority government, to focus on its responsibilities. Its central mission is to protect our people, especially retirees between the ages of 65 and 74, the people it deliberately set aside in favour of its own priorities, which are not Quebeckers' priorities. The rest will be judged on merit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558911">We will oppose even the slightest interference, including on a confidence vote. If the government ever contradicts the unanimous will of Quebec's National Assembly in the slightest, we will oppose it, including on a confidence vote. When we find that the government has failed to recognize its minority status and the importance of heeding the Bloc Québécois's demands, which are widely supported in Quebec, we will pull the plug. Doing so today, before we even know whether the government is cognizant of the new reality, would amount to taking a decent retirement income away from Quebec seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558912">What is more, we promised farmers that we would do everything in our power to protect supply management. As the member for Shefford, I have no choice but to say it. The members for <Affiliation DbId="278281" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278373" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation> will be in the Senate tomorrow morning to encourage senators to quickly pass our Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C-282</Document>, which was passed by the House almost a year and a half ago. This bill would prevent any future government from creating new breaches in the supply management system for farmers in Quebec. That is crucial. These are real issues facing real people, not the frenzied spectacle that the Conservatives are putting on today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558913">Voting in favour of the Conservatives' motion would be irresponsible and unworthy of the mandate Quebeckers gave us to defend them. As members of Parliament, our work is to represent and defend our constituents. That is why we were elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558914"> The Conservatives' motion has nothing to do with any issue whatsoever. In fact, the Conservatives' motion is just a game. We have all seen the polls, and we know that the current government is nearing its end. What is more, we are eager to ask Quebeckers again for their support. We have always done everything we can to show them we are worthy of their trust. That is what we are doing once again today. Given the results of the LaSalle—Émard—Verdun by-election, we have nothing to fear on that account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558915"> However, it is far from certain that a new government will be for the best. Every time the Conservative Party talks about public policy, it is to ask for the elimination of the carbon tax outside Quebec. There is absolutely nothing for Quebeckers in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558916"> Claiming that the Bloc Québécois has become friends with the federal Liberals is just nonsense. We trust Quebeckers, but the House of Commons and the federal government are controlled by Canadians. Moreover, the Bloc Québécois has no faith in any government in the federal system. Today's motion would have us choose between the Liberals and the Conservatives in Canada, but we choose Quebec. We want more for Quebec. Right now, we are trying to help our people. Then we will decide if it is worth it, but not today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558917"> A majority of the House of Commons passed Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document> in principle. After a detailed study of the text, the committee unanimously returned it to the House of Commons for final passage, which could happen within the next few weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558918"> There is, however, a problem. Since the bill involves spending, the government has veto rights. We are asking the government to lift its veto and give royal recommendation to Bill C-319 so Parliament can pass it at third reading. In committee, the members from all parties voted in favour of the bill. However, today, when it comes time to buckle down and implement the bill, the Liberals and Conservatives appear to be hesitating. I remind you that the first part of the bill aims to eliminate discrimination based on age. Let us put an end to this unacceptable inequity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558919"> In the 2021 budget, the Liberals created two classes of seniors. People aged 75 and over saw their pension increase by 10%. People between the ages of 65 and 74 got nothing. It is time to put an end to this. I am not the only one saying it: Every seniors' group I have talked to in my two-year tour agrees. I see my colleagues. I met with seniors in Mirabel, Terrebonne and Abitibi-Témiscamingue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558920">Everyone agrees, including the people at FADOQ. Enough is enough. Let us put an end to this unacceptable inequity. Let us give the government one last chance. We must seek royal recommendation for the dignity of seniors.</ParaText>

One value we all share is our support for a universal and entirely free public health care system. Unfortunately, decades of budget cuts have put our health care system at risk. We know that Conservative leaders have made cuts to health care in the past. The Conservative Party did the same during its time in office and wants to do so again. It voted against dental care and universal pharmacare. It continually votes against our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558936">As a result, unless our health care system receives sufficient funding, people will have to wait longer for the services they need. The Conservatives want to privatize our health care system. This means that people will have to pay for access to services, which goes against Canadians' values. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558937">We saw that the Liberals did not have the courage or the strength to stop the Conservatives' budget cuts across the country.

              <ParaText id="8558939">Canadians believe fundamentally that we are better off when we take care of each other, when we look out for our neighbours, when we look out for one another and when we lift each other up. When we do that, we all rise together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558940">Everyone should be able to have a good job that allows them to find a place they can afford to live in, to put food on the table and to have a fridge full of groceries. We believe fundamentally that Canadians share the value, as the New Democrats do, of having a health care system that is public, universal and completely free, so people do not have to pay out of pocket.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558941">We do not believe that Canadians should have to worry about racking up credit card debt to see a doctor. People should not have to worry about choosing to pay for a doctor over buying groceries for their family. This should not be a choice that Canadians have to make. We believe in a system that is there for people when they need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558942">Sadly, people are losing hope. They see our health care system eroding. They see that it is impossible to build a good life. They see costs continuing to rise. They see that it is harder to put food on the table, to buy groceries and to pay rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558943"> Also, Canadians are worried each time they have to take their loved ones to see a doctor or when they get care for themselves. They are worried that getting better will be connected to a bill, a bill to see the doctor or to join a membership to even see a doctor. Canadians are worried that there is going to be a bill attached to buying the medication they need to stay well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558944">A bill for health care is the cost of the Conservatives. Every time Canadians see a doctor to get the health care they or their loved ones need, there will be a bill. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> was in cabinet, and let us be very clear, contrary to what he said, he and his party cut and gut health care. In fact, the Conservatives cut $43.5 billion out of health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558945"> The Conservatives might try to play loose with the facts, but the reality is that they cut health care, and it hurt. Premiers lined up to complain about the Harper cuts. People lined up to say that it was wrong. The Conservatives cut and it hurt. In fact, right off the bat, they cut 163 Canadian doctors and nurses. Wait times got longer. It was harder to find a family doctor. Waiting times in the emergency room skyrocketed. The wait for surgeries ballooned. People felt the pain. There is a cost to the Conservatives, and that cost is that people pay the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558946">We do not have to look very far. We know that cutting health care is at the very core of Conservative values. We can see that happening right now. Conservative premiers are, brick by brick, trying to destroy our health care system. In Ontario, we know that Doug Ford is gleefully cutting health care, destroying our public health care system, putting health care workers and money into private clinics, which starves public health care, starves the public hospitals, and people end up waiting longer and longer to get that care. Conservative Premier Danielle Smith is destroying health care in Alberta. This is what Conservatives do. Look to any Conservative province, look to any province where Conservatives have been in power, and look at the state of the health care system. It will be in shambles, because that is what Conservatives do. They cut health care and people know it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558947">The more the Conservatives cut, the more the health care system falls apart. They set up the argument that now that they have starved this thing, now that they have broken it and it is not working, they will sell it to their greedy CEO corporate buddies and let them profit from it. For the Conservatives, they see sick people as an untapped cash cow. They look at sick people and ask how they can profit from their pain. They ask how they can profit from people who are sick. They ask how they can help their corporate buddies make money from their pain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558948">Right now, companies like Maple are charging Canadians up to $100 to visit a doctor, on top of a membership fee that they have to subscribe to be on the list to see those doctors. Who owns Maple? It turns out that it is owned by Loblaw. For the Conservatives, when it comes to the same corporate grocery store that sets our grocery prices and is ripping us off, they want it to also set the prices when it comes to seeing a doctor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558949">Here is what is even more shocking. The chief adviser to the Conservatives, Jenni Byrne, is a lobbyist for none other than Loblaw. Conservative insiders are directly benefiting from the privatization of our health care system. The Conservatives want to stop pharmacare. They voted against increases to our health care system in February 2023. They want to cut the pensions of people. They want to cut dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558950">We want to strengthen pensions. We want to expand dental care. We want to ensure health care is there for us when we need it. They want to cut health care. We want to shorten wait times. That is why we are not going to let the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservatives call the shots. We are going to vote today against Conservative cuts and against a Conservative motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558951">Let us take a minute to talk about the Liberals. The Liberals claim that they care about our health care system. They claim that they want to defend it, as if they are not in power and do not have the power to do something about it. When I mention the cuts that are happening to health care by provincial premiers, the Liberal government is standing by and letting them do it. It is letting our health care system be privatized. The Liberals are not using the federal tools, the tools that we have in the Canada Health Act. They are allowing it to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558952">In fact, we put forward a motion to stop the flow of public money, at the federal level, going to for-profit clinics. That motion was a strong signal to say that, no, we would not let this happen anymore. What did the Liberals do? They voted against that motion. They voted to allow for-profit companies to continue to starve our public health care system. When the private system takes all the health care workers and all the money, there is less in the public system and people have to wait longer in the ER rooms. They have to wait longer for their public care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558953">The Liberal government has done nothing to ban for-profit companies from scooping up health care workers. We have seen it do nothing to stop for-profit clinics that continue to rip off Canadians. It is because the Liberal government is too weak to stand up to Danielle Smith, too weak to stand up to Doug Ford and, frankly, too weak to stop the Conservative cuts proposed by the federal Conservatives. The Liberals are telling Canadians, when Conservative premiers tell us to pay up or wait longer, that this is okay, that they are going to do nothing about it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8558973">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak right after the leader of the NDP, who gave an excellent speech. He outlined the framework for this discussion and explained where we stand right now as a society, what people need and the risks associated with either the Liberals' inaction or the Conservatives' cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558974">Over the past two years, we have seen what can be achieved when NDP members are on the job. We delivered results by pressuring the government and making real gains for people, for workers, for seniors, for families and for students. That is the contribution the NDP caucus can make, using its position of strength and balance of power to obtain things that neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals had ever agreed to before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558975">With a bit of a wink and a nudge, I would like to point out that, for two years, the Bloc Québécois criticized us for negotiating with the Liberals to make gains. Now that we have torn up the agreement, it is rather ironic to see the Bloc Québécois wanting to negotiate with the government as well, but that is politics, after all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558976">We were able to achieve tangible progress of historic importance. Think of the 10 days of paid sick leave for federally regulated workers, which did not exist before. We saw how important it was to grant workers this right during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the NDP that did that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558977">The anti-scab law is finally in effect, 50 years after Quebec passed its own law. We fought and forced the Liberal government to introduce anti-scab legislation, which was a historic demand of the Quebec and Canadian labour movement. I am very proud to have been able to negotiate with the then minister of labour. It is an important piece of legislation that is a true hallmark of the gains the NDP was able to achieve. The anti-scab legislation is a victory for the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558978">The big one is universal public pharmacare. This is so important to so many members of society, in both Canada and Quebec, who are suffering because our hybrid private-public system is flawed. The NDP was able to get $1.5 billion. The bill is currently before the Senate. This will make a difference in people's lives, especially the first phase that provides access to contraception and diabetes medications. Millions of people with diabetes will be reimbursed for the cost of supplies and drugs to fight this terrible disease. This is a victory for the NDP and its work. It is also what the Quebec labour movement is calling for. The FTQ, the CSN, the CSQ and the Union des consommateurs du Québec all know that a universal public pharmacare program is the best way to get truly affordable drugs to treat people and save lives. That has been proven in study after study over the past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558979">We secured $8 billion for indigenous housing. We forced the Liberals to ensure that the federal child care transfer will go to public and not-for-profit child care run by community groups and non-profits. That is a win for the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558980">There is also the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act, which ensures a just transition, a green energy transition, as well as job creation for workers. The NDP fought to have union and worker representatives at the table to ensure the success of this transition, which is so important to the future of our planet, our economic development, and good jobs for workers. I salute the work of some of my colleagues, including my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, who is right over there. I also salute my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> for his very hard work on Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558981">Obviously, the NDP deserves credit for all the work it accomplished on providing people with access to dental care. Some of them had not been able to afford a visit to the dentist in years. We were able to secure these major gains by putting pressure on the Liberals. So far, 3.5 million people in Canada have registered for the program. Some 645,000 people have managed to see a dentist and be reimbursed all or 80% of the cost of their dental care. That is huge. The health and lives of those 645,000 people has changed for the better through the direct efforts of the NDP here in the House. I am very proud to say that those 645,000 people include 205,032 Quebeckers, who were able to see a dentist thanks to the NDP's work and victory.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8558982">This means that 32% of the people who have benefited from the program are Quebeckers. The program is therefore very beneficial for Quebec, for Quebeckers, who are participating more on average than people in the other provinces. We represent 23% of the Canadian population, but 32% of the people who have received this service are from Quebec. I would remind the House that not only did the Bloc Québécois oppose dental care, but the Conservatives have always voted against it, and the Liberals also voted against it before the last election. This just goes to show that if we had not been there, if we had not twisted their arm, this would never have happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558983">The agreement lasted a while, but we were not married to the Liberals. We were carpooling. We eventually realized that it was time to go our separate ways, so we got out of that car and into our own, to regain our independence and autonomy. Going forward, we will decide on a case-by-case basis how we are going to vote in the House as a political party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558984">We also put an end to this agreement because of a build-up of frustration with the Liberals' inaction, half-measures and lack of courage on a whole host of issues. We decided that we are going to be completely autonomous. There are some things that we completely disagree with the Liberals on and so we want to be able to exert all the pressure we can and to do our job as the opposition as effectively as possible. I am talking in particular about environmental and climate issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558985">One can only imagine how infuriating it is to face the Liberals' inaction and contradictions, when this failure to make the necessary decisions today is going to affect future generations, our children and our grandchildren. In the last budget, the Liberals backtracked on taxing the excessive profits of big oil. Big oil lobbyists came to Ottawa, to the office of the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, and the government decided that it would not tax the windfall profits of oil and gas companies after all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558986">The fact that there is no emissions cap in the oil and gas sector is shameful. One has to wonder why it still has not been set. Then there are the tax credits for carbon capture, an unproven technology that does not work. It is a great subsidy for the oil companies, but not as great as buying the Trans Mountain pipeline, which cost Canadians $36 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558987">That $36 billion means that everyone in the country, whether they are a grandpa, a grandma, a student or a baby, paid $1,000 to buy that pipeline and increase our greenhouse gas emissions. The Liberals took $1,000 from every Canadian to buy a pipeline that no one wanted. Even the private sector did not want it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558988">There is also the matter of the inaction in relation to the housing crisis and the price of groceries, despite the fact that there are solutions. There is the Liberals' lack of courage regarding the genocide in Gaza, the lack of recognition of the Palestinian state, the lack of sanctions against Netanyahu's extremist ministers, and the continued sale of arms to this regime, which has been dropping bombs on ordinary people every day for over 10 months now. Then there is the Liberals' failure to reform EI, despite their promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558989">Although we are debating this motion today, the NDP's message is clear. We will not play the Conservatives' game. We are not going to play the Conservatives' game, because we remember the dark years under Stephen Harper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558990">We remember the attacks on science, the blindness or indifference to the climate crisis and the cuts to culture. We remember the $43 billion in cuts to our public health care system, the repercussions of which are still being felt today. When the Liberals came to power, they did not reverse those budget cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558991">They cut seniors' pensions by increasing the retirement age to 67. They abolished 26,000 public service jobs and closed nine Veterans Affairs Canada offices. They made cuts to employment insurance, to support for indigenous communities, to protection for women and women's issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558992">As far as women's rights are concerned, the right to abortion is still under threat. Things are not entirely clear in the Conservative caucus. Statements are vague. There are photos with certain groups, with certain demonstrators here on Parliament Hill. This morning, in the Journal de Montréal we read that the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="278230" Type="2">Cypress Hills—Grasslands</Affiliation> visited a creationist and anti-abortion, or anti-choice, church in Florida.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8558993">He was invited to deliver a speech at an extremist church in Florida, and it was the church that paid for not only his flight, but also all the expenses. A Conservative member went to Florida and was paid by a church to speak against women's rights. After all that, it should come as no surprise that people question whether the Conservatives will protect women's rights or if a private member's bill will be introduced if ever, by some misfortune, the Conservatives form a majority government. </ParaText>

Over the last three years, they have enabled the government to increase taxes on Canadians at every single juncture, whether through its budgets or the implementation of the carbon tax, which affects the cost of everything. He talked a lot about cuts, but he supported the carbon tax initiation, as well as every single increase since then, with his party through the government. This has increased the cost of housing, the cost of food, the cost of fuel and the cost of energy for every single Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559003"> My question is very simple. Why did that member and his party cut the disposable income of every single Canadian?</ParaText>

So far, 205,032 people in Quebec have gone to the dentist thanks to the work of the NDP. We campaigned on that promise. We did it for Quebeckers. We are talking 205,000 people in Quebec alone. Quebec accounts for 32% of the people who have benefited from the program, yet we represent 23% of the population. The province that benefits most from the dental care program is Quebec.</ParaText>

Everyone in the House, whether Conservative, Bloc Québécois, NDP, Green, Liberal or even independent, will have to reveal whether they have confidence in this Prime Minister, after nine years of Liberal governance that has changed Canada like no other prime minister has ever done before, a prime minister in a minority government who, up until now, had bought his survival by making a pact with the NDP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559036">That is how the NDP-Liberal coalition blew up, leaving no trace of the little orange frog, not that the bullock cares.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559037">That is what just happened. Their deal had a disastrous impact on Canadian families, workers and businesses. The no-good Liberal government survived thanks to that deal, but it caused the worst inflation we have seen in 40 years. This Prime Minister increased the national debt more than all of his predecessors combined. Violent crime is on the rise across Canada. The streets are getting more dangerous. Too many Canadians are living on the street or in tents because they can no longer afford an apartment or because they are victims of the hard-drug epidemic plaguing the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559038">This bad Liberal government, with the support of the Bloc Québécois, doubled our national debt with over $500 billion in inflationary spending. Bloc Québécois members have voted nearly 200 times to keep the most incompetent prime minister in our history in power. This bad government literally killed the dream that young Canadians have of one day owning their own home. This bad government is responsible for so many ethical breaches that we do not have enough fingers to count them. This bad Liberal government, to satisfy its Prime Minister's obvious natural propensity for spending, did not hesitate for a second to trample on provincial jurisdictions. This bad Liberal government succeeded in swelling the public service by over 40%, hiring more than 100,000 new public servants, yet Canadians cannot get simple answers to their questions over the phone. We can all testify to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559039">Following a misguided tweet from the Prime Minister, this bad Liberal government completely destroyed an immigration system that was working relatively well, pushing Quebec to a breaking point. As for social services, infrastructure is not keeping pace with the rhythm imposed by this post-national Prime Minister. This Prime Minister, by the admission of one of his own MPs, is taking a divide and conquer approach to Canadians. This reminds me of one of the very first promises from this bad Prime Minister, during my first federal election campaign. Those who were elected in 2015 will remember. He said he would run small deficits for two years in a row. Then, it would be even smaller, and then we would go back to a balanced budget before the end of his term. Nine years later, that promise is completely meaningless. The term “balanced budget” does not exist in this bad government's budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559040">Despite all of that, despite the end of their coalition, despite the bad government, despite all the noise coming from the NDP on September 4 when the orange coalition frog exploded, the NDP says it still has confidence in this government. The NDP is still going to vote for this bad Prime Minister to allow him to continue. “Continue” is the Prime Minister's favourite word. He is going to continue to hurt Canada a bit longer. NDP voters are going to remember that, but there is worse. The grand prize for deception goes to the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Mr. Speaker, I refuse to believe that the Prime Minister is working hand in hand with Quebec. On the contrary, I believe he has his hand in Quebeckers' pockets. He is blatantly abusing the fiscal imbalance. He is blatantly abusing his spending power. Furthermore, he is racking up an appalling deficit that Quebeckers will be paying off for a long time to come simply to save his government's skin, and his own skin, in the next election.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559043">That is the quite the condemnation of the last budget and of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Who said that? Was it a Conservative? It sounds like something a Conservative might have said, but it was not a Conservative. It was the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the Bloc Québécois, the new political lieutenant for Quebec for this bad Prime Minister, who said that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559044">Despite all of the Bloc Québécois's grandstanding and fancy speeches and all of the pompous speeches its leader gives everywhere, the Bloc is preparing to tell the Prime Minister that he does not have to worry, that the Bloc has confidence in him, even if he has a bad government, even if he has his hands in Quebeckers' pockets and even if he is blatantly abusing the fiscal imbalance. That is clear. Even before the Bloc got anything from the government, it announced that it still appreciated the Liberal Prime Minister. The Bloc announced that it was going to vote in favour of this bad Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559045">It is going to vote against the simple little motion I read out at the beginning, which says that the House has no confidence in this Prime Minister and the government. It is a simple motion. If the Bloc Québécois really wanted to walk the talk, it would vote with the Conservatives tomorrow. If they vote against a simple motion like this, it is because they like the Prime Minister. It is because they want this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to stay in power time and again. In the words of the leader of the Bloc Québécois, “Quebeckers will be paying...for a long time to come simply to save his government's skin...in the next election”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559046">Today, the leader of the “Liberal Bloc”, the new coalition set to save the Prime Minister, is still talking out of both sides of his mouth to keep his place at the head of the parade by saying one thing and then the opposite in the same tweet. He announces his support for the Prime Minister while threatening to defeat him. Actions speak louder than words, and there is seldom any shortage of words when the leader of the Bloc Québécois takes the floor. The choice is clear. A vote for the motion is a vote to bring down a bad government. It is a vote to end federal Liberal interference in Quebec's jurisdictions and to restore hope to Quebeckers. A vote against the motion is a vote against Quebeckers, whose grocery bills have skyrocketed, who can no longer afford their mortgage payments, who no longer have access to housing, and who want the streets made safe again for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559047">I am often asked what the Conservatives have planned. It is simple and easy to remember. The next Conservative government's plan is to focus on Quebeckers and Canadians. What is the plan? A common-sense Conservative government will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. This needs to happen, and it needs to happen now, after nine years of this bad Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559048">We have to respect the Canadian voters and Quebec voters who elected a minority government. I say that because it is not said often enough. A minority government as bad as this one should not live to see another day. Again, I invite all parliamentarians who have doubts about the quality and competence of this Prime Minister to vote in favour of our motion and not to show more love for the Liberal Prime Minister by voting against the motion. It is time to give Canadians and Quebeckers a real choice and trigger an election to elect a common-sense Conservative government.</ParaText>

Parliament is the master of everything, regardless of the captain's political stripe. As our colleague just pointed out, any time a minority government is elected—and this government just became a minority again—when a parliamentarian is in opposition, they get on board and play the game, even though I personally do not believe that the Canadian parliamentary system is a good one. However, that is what we have right now, so we are using it to make any gains we can. That is what it means to take the opposition role seriously and constructively.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559074"> I rise today in the chamber to declare what millions of Canadians already know to be true: The Liberal government, led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has failed our country. The Prime Minister has failed the Canadian people. He has failed to uphold the trust that was placed upon him, not once, not twice, but three times. After nine long years of broken promises, skyrocketing costs, crumbling institutions and countless scandals, it is now crystal clear that the Liberal government no longer commands the confidence of the Canadian people, nor should it command the confidence of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559075"> Let us be clear: Our country is broken. This is not just the rhetoric of the opposition; it is a fact evident in the daily lives of Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Nine years ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised us “sunny ways”. He promised to uplift the middle class, make life more affordable and restore confidence in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559076">However, after almost a decade, what do we have to show for it? We have a country where everything is more expensive, where families struggle to afford the most basic necessities, where crime is surging, where overdoses are claiming thousands of lives, where mental health is at its worst level ever, where hope for the future is dwindling and where overdose is the leading cause of death for youth aged 12 to 18 in my province of British Columbia. That is the record of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The Prime Minister and the Liberal government are to blame for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559077">Let us begin by talking about the cost of living, which has spiralled out of control under the Liberal government's watch. Under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership, the dream of home ownership has slipped away from millions of young Canadians. In 2015, the average price of a home in Canada was just under $440,000. Today that price has ballooned to over $750,000, a staggering 66% increase. In cities like Vancouver and Toronto, the numbers are even more horrifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559078"> How are young families supposed to save for a down payment when prices soar at this rate? Consequently, a staggering two-thirds of young Canadians believe they will never be able to afford a home. Rent has doubled. The needed down payment has doubled. Home prices have doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559079"> Not only that, but homeless encampments are springing up all across our country by the hundreds. There are 1,800 homeless encampments in this province alone. In my province, rest areas along the highway are becoming encampments with RVs and trailers because people cannot afford to buy a home and cannot afford to pay rent. That is the stark reality. That is the record under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559080"> It is not just housing. Let us talk about groceries. Food prices have increased by almost 10% over the past year alone, and 20% of Canadians, two million Canadians, accessed a food bank just last month. That is staggering. The average family of four now spends over $15,000 per year just to put food on the table. What has the Liberal government done? It has dismissed these hardships with platitudes while ordinary Canadians are forced to make impossible decisions between feeding their families and paying their bills. Liberals said that Canadians have never had it so good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559081"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has printed money like it is his job, recklessly adding more to the national debt than all other prime ministers in the history of our country combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559082"> The cost of gas has shot through the roof, with prices reaching over $2 per litre in some provinces this year alone. Families are paying more at the pumps. Truckers are paying more to deliver goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559083"> We know that if they tax the farmer that produces the food and tax the trucker that ships the food, it is Canadians that pay the price for that food. What is the Liberal response to this? They will raise the taxes. They will move to quadruple their carbon tax to 61¢ per litre, punishing hard-working Canadians even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559084"> Our communities look like war zones. I ask Canadians who are watching this from the gallery today and at home to take a look at their neighbourhoods and their communities. Do they look the way they did nine years ago? No, they do not. Crime is up. Overdoses are up. The failures of the current government go far beyond economics. Under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal government, our communities have become less safe. Crime is on the rise in every part of this country. Violent crime has increased by 50% since the Prime Minister took office in 2015.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559085">Violent gun crime is up by 116%. Murders are up 28%. Gang-related murders are up 78%. Sexual assaults are up 75%. Auto theft is up 46%, and extortion is up a whopping 357%. The streets of our cities, once safe and welcoming, now bear the scars of neglect with spikes in gang violence, drug-related crimes and random assaults. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s solution to this is a hug-a-thug, catch-and-release, soft-on-crime, revolving-door justice system that benefits the criminals at the expense of Canadians' safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559086">Now I will move on to a topic that is near and dear to me. Since 2016, over 47,000 Canadians have lost their life to overdose. The government has spent over a billion dollars on failed drug policies. When I think about this, I think about Mr. Charles and Mrs. MacDonald, whose daughter Brianna, aged just 13, died in a homeless encampment due to overdose just last month. I think about my own brother, who is on the street, gripped in this crisis. We can perpetuate somebody's addiction but we cannot get them into treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559087">That is the failed record of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I have spent nine minutes speaking about the Liberals' failed record. I have not even touched on the scandals and the corruption the Prime Minister has brought to the House. We are the laughingstock on the international stage. The Prime Minister wants to be known more for his socks than for the work he does here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559088">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> kicked to the curb the first indigenous female Attorney General because she spoke truth to power and would not back his corrupt ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559089">I will leave the House with this: We can do better. The time for change is now. We can no longer allow the government to stumble from scandal to scandal, leaving Canadians to pick up the pieces.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559105">Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge that I will be splitting my time this afternoon with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. I look forward to his remarks as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559106">Today we have a motion from the opposition on non-confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government. Although it is not binding, of course, the convention would be that, if a majority of members of Parliament voted in favour, it would trigger an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559107"> I will be very clear that I will be voting against this motion. It gives me an opportunity to talk about why I have confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government, as well as an opportunity to opine a bit on what I have observed through five years sitting in this House with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. It is very clear that the members of the Conservative Party want an election right now. I look forward to digging into the rationale and some of the concerns that I would have, in contrasting our approach to theirs. That is where I am going to start, because if Conservatives are hell-bent on an election, it is important for Canadians to understand the different approaches that we would take as political parties and as members of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559108">As I have sat in this House and listened over the last couple of hours of this debate, particularly to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, who was just up, there is no nuance to the positions. It is simply all-in that this is to be true, with very few statistics to back it up. The member quoted some statistics, some of which have no or very little correlation to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the Government of Canada with respect to even its jurisdiction to govern these issues. This is the reality. It is more of an emotional appeal than a rational appeal. Therefore, I look forward to trying to explain some of where I stand on this as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559109"> I want to start with the economy. Conservatives will often stand up, as an opposition in this place, and talk about the economy. They will talk about some of the affordability challenges out there which, by the way, are very real. The government has acknowledged that and I think many members of Parliament have acknowledged that, as well as the initiatives we can take on as parliamentarians to support Canadians who are going through a difficult time. However, Conservatives never talk about Canada in comparison to other countries in the world of comparable fashion. They never talk about Canadian successes. Yes, it is their job to oppose, but if they want to keep some level of credibility in this place, we would think that they would be able to contrast some of the things that are happening in the country that are good and some of the things that are challenging that they want to see the government work on harder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559110">Here are a few facts and statistics. As it relates to interest cuts, around the world we have seen central banks raise interest rates as a result of the inflation that is being felt around the world. We would not know that when we hear from the members of the official opposition, who would suggest that it is only in Canada that inflation exists. That is simply not the case. Canada is actually leading the G7 in relation to interest rate cuts. That is as a direct result of the fact that the government has laid out a fiscal plan that it intends to maintain with respect to balancing investments that matter for Canadians, but at the same time making sure that there is a credible path to a declining debt-to-GDP ratio over time. We never hear that from the opposition benches. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559111">We are actually expected to be second in overall economic growth on a GDP basis in the G7 in 2024, and leading in the G7 in 2025. We would not find that in the Hansard from the official opposition whatsoever, but those are the statistics that are being projected in the days ahead. We have been second in overall cumulative economic growth in the G7 since 2015. If we listen to the opposition, who would suggest that the country is broken, nothing good is happening and there have been no successes, how do they contend with that fact? How do they contend with the fact that we have had the second-highest GDP growth of all G7 comparative countries? That is a reality. That is a fact. It is a statistic, not an emotion. It is not a feeling; it is real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559112">I will grant, and I have been critical in this House, including against the government caucus that I sit in, that productivity is an issue and that we have to focus on that, but it is something the government has acknowledged in its own remarks and presentations. Yes, there is more work to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559113">With respect to this idea that the country is broken, that nothing good has happened and what have we seen in nine years, we have the second-highest GDP growth in the G7. That would be my response to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>. Inflation is back down to 2%. That is a really important thing. We know that when inflation is high, it has an impact on everyday, working Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559114">What I want to highlight, because I hear it in my riding, and I am sympathetic to the challenges that are there, is this. People are saying that inflation is back down, but their wages have not gone up. In some cases, I am sure that is true, there are some Canadians who may not have seen a pay increase in their particular circumstances, but when we look at the totality of the Canadian economy, for the last 18 months we have seen wage growth in this country outpace inflation. We have seen that Canada is leading the G7 on wage growth relative to inflation from the fourth quarter of 2019 to now. We would never hear the opposition talk about that. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559115"> Again, I am not trying to negate the fact that there are challenges out there; there are. However, we have to have a bit of reality in this place and try to find some balance about what we should be doing and how we should be presenting to Canadians. I do not stand here to suggest that everything is perfect, but I stand here in contrast to the official opposition, who want to burn it down, with every speech sounding very similar in its outlook. The Conservatives' message discipline is great. I wonder who is writing those speeches, because it does not seem like it is an authentic message coming from the opposition benches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559116"> How about foreign direct investment? There was the third-highest amount of foreign direct investment in this country of all countries, in 2023, whether that is Michelin in Nova Scotia, BHP in Saskatchewan or maybe Volkswagen in Ontario, and I could go on. There are good things happening in this country because the government is laying the foundation to draw in generational investment that is going to matter for Canadian jobs, today and in the years ahead. Conservatives do not recognize those positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559117"> Let us talk about debt position. We heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation> talk about a debt and the fact that it has accumulated under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The member failed to mention that we had a pandemic that was a once-in-100-years event that required the government to step in and support Canadians. If the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> had his way, those big fat government programs that supported Canadians at the height of their need would not have been available. Where would we have been on the economic recovery, had the Conservatives actually been in power? I suggest they would not have stepped up for small business owners and individuals who were being impacted at the most uncertain time in the last 100 years as it relates to global health. The Conservatives do not acknowledge that whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559118"> Let us talk about the environment. This matters to Canadians. We are seeing it. Mr. Speaker, you are from Nova Scotia. We have seen extreme weather over the last couple of summers in our own constituencies. This is a reality. This is on the ground. We are dealing with this today. This is perhaps where there is the most contrast between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. At the end of the day, we are the only government in Canadian history that has actually reduced emissions and grown the economy at the same time. The Conservatives have slogans. They have very little as it relates to an actual environmental plan. That is getting fleshed out every day here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559119">Let me speak about affordability, health and housing. There are the Canada child benefit, the national child care program and dental care for seniors, which the Conservatives are noncommittal about keeping for my seniors and your seniors in <Affiliation DbId="278106" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, Mr. Speaker. How about pharmacare? There is no commitment regarding where the Conservatives stand on that. We have had challenges with respect to housing. Three levels of government are responsible. Successive federal governments got out of the business of housing and we are trying to get back in and support it. In 2023, we had the most housing starts in Nova Scotia since 1940. That is a direct result of this government's investment and support and initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559120">How about increases for seniors? We have actually been there to help support seniors in their need. I will remind my opposition colleagues that the Conservatives actually would have proposed to move the age of eligibility for seniors up to 67 before they even got their entitlement from the OAS. The Conservatives announced that at the World Economic Forum. I know the Conservatives like to play into this idea that the World Economic Forum has taken over the world. It was the Conservatives' prime minister who went there and announced that initiative, back in the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559121">Last, I want to talk about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> because he is the leader of the official opposition. He is the one who wants to call an election and wants to be prime minister. What is concerning is that I came over here to the House and I heard the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> using the word “cronies” with regard to the idea that people were gouging and making personal attacks of CEOs on the floor of the House of Commons. Other members of Parliament might have a view as it relates to Bell Canada and whether it is a good thing for Canada. However, when someone stands in the House of Commons, wants to be the prime minister of this country and makes personal attacks from that vantage point, they call into question a company that employs thousands of hard-working Canadians. Then, they attack the journalists. It is not just CTV; my God, it is CBC. Is there any media outlet that the leader of the official opposition actually will not attack? He attacks experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559122">However, because I have watched the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> for five years, I will say this to the House. It is concerning when we throw rocks when we live in a glass house. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> has gone on at great length about the fact that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> lives 30 minutes outside of the House of Commons at Stornoway, costing hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars. The Leader of the Opposition then calls into question the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> with respect to why that individual serves Canadians in Parliament, supposedly around a pension, when that guy, the Leader of the Opposition, has not worked a day in his life outside of this place and collected a pension at 31. I think that is the most hypocritical position I have seen in the House of Commons. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559124">Mr. Speaker, as it relates to carbon pricing, I have actually taken this government to task, to adjust the national program in the interest of supporting rural Canadians, but let me be very clear. I do support the government's environmental agenda. When I look across to the opposition, I do not see much of an environmental agenda whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559125">I take notice of the hon. member opposite. Yes, he has rightfully fought to try to make sure there are further adjustments and refinements to the national program to make sure his constituents, who I think are demonstrably rural, are supportive. However, let us not mistake the facts on a couple of things. This government does have an environmental agenda that matters. It has actually grown the economy while reducing emissions at the same time. As it relates to Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, he should walk across and talk to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278218" Type="2">Huron—Bruce</Affiliation> about when he is going to let it be called to a vote. Our farmers in this country deserve Bill C-234 to be passed but the Conservatives are standing in the way of letting it be called to a vote. We need to have that vote sooner rather than later.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559136"> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that the particular motion we are debating today in fact reflects the leadership of the Conservative Party. I should say the “Conservative-Reform party”. That far-right influence continues to dictate the type of policy directives that we see. It does kind of seep out at times from the Conservative Party today. As I listen to members, I would like them to reflect on what we are actually voting on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559137">The Conservatives say it is a motion of confidence in the government. I would put the question in a different way. I would suggest that this is a question of confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, who has one mission and one mission only, and it is driven by a thirst for power. He is not concerned about what is taking place in our communities in all the different regions of the country. He is not concerned about issues of inflation or affordability. He has the slogans, and he has the bumper stickers ready. His only focus is that thirst for power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559138">At the very first opportunity he gets, he brings in a motion of non-confidence. We are in to debate now for five or six days, and they have already brought in four days on which we debated concurrence motions, instead of having a debate on government and private members' legislation that could, in fact, be passing. I am thinking of the military to civil courts legislation that the Conservatives support, but they continue to filibuster it. They have a constant attitude of trying to play the role of a destructive force on the floor of the House of Commons. They are prepared to put their self-interest ahead of the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559139">I hope that when we see the ultimate vote on today's motion, they will take the time to reflect that it is time to cool down on their thirst for power and start putting more of a focus on what is in the best interest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559140"> I listened to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>'s personal attack on CTV and how disgraceful it was. We are used to CBC. We have three national television networks, and because he does not like the factual information that is going out on them, he takes the opportunity here on the floor of the House of Commons to attack them. It does not surprise me, because I suspect that there has never been a leader of any national political party that has been as intentionally misleading as this leader has on many different fronts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559141">We just started the session back up for the fall. Caucus meetings took place in all the political parties.

In his speech, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> said that they are going to be there for health care. That is balderdash. The Liberal government brought in our health care system, and people such as Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin preserved it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559150">Just an hour or so ago, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> said that Conservatives delivered on health care and provided the money. That is garbage. It was a Paul Martin agreement with the health accord that saw a 6% increase for provinces in health care transfers. That is what delivered the health care increases. It had nothing to do with Stephen Harper. In fact, when those agreements expired, what was the first thing Harper did? He decreased them. That is the reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559151">What does the current government do? No government in the last 60 years has committed as many dollars to public health care as this one has, including $198 billion over 10 years. What are the Conservatives going to do about that? They are trying to say they care about health care, but their attitude towards health care is to get rid of it. We see that in their actions and the words they often use. They do not believe the federal government needs to play that role. Will they, in fact, enforce such things as the Canada Health Act? We can look at their response to pharmacare: The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> mocked the government for pursuing a national pharmacare program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559152">I have news for members opposite. The original idea or plan for the health care system was to have a pharmacare program, to ensure that there was more financial accountability and to ensure that we had things like the Canada Health Act. I remind the Conservatives of this: They can campaign against health care all they want, but a vast majority of Canadians care deeply and passionately about our health care system. The leader of the Conservative Party is way off base on that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559153">I had a tough time listening when the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was glorifying Stephen Harper.

Do they not realize that Stephen Harper actually cancelled, not delayed or postponed, but cancelled the sponsoring of parents and grandparents? It took years for someone's spouse to be able to come to Canada under the Harper regime. Immigration was a disaster in many ways under Stephen Harper, yet the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> glorifies it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559156">I could not believe it when the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> talked about housing. He was the minister of housing, but how many houses did he build? A person barely needs two hands to count them. He built six. That is it. If he were a decent minister of housing, we might not have issues to the degree we have them today. If there was a government that did not believe in a national presence on the housing file, it was Stephen Harper's, with the file led by the current leader of the Conservative Party. I cannot imagine how the Conservatives could try to say that they would be able to deal with the housing issue in Canada over what the Liberal government has done. We have invested more and worked more with other levels of government in order to deal with the important issues than has been done in generations. That applies not only to housing but also to a wide spectrum of issues in which the quality of life is improving in all regions of our country.</ParaText>

That is because after nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, life has never been harder for Canadians. His failed policies, propped up by the NDP at every opportunity, have doubled the debt, doubled housing costs, caused the worst inflation in 40 years, sent a record number of Canadians to food banks and unleashed crime and chaos in our communities. </ParaText>

In a single month last year, food banks had a record two million visits. Year over year, the Prime Minister's inflation and taxes have caused grocery prices to surge. The average Canadian family will pay $700 more above and beyond the high prices they paid last year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559177">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s plan to quadruple his punishing carbon tax is only going to make things worse. In the midst of an ongoing affordability crisis in our country, the Prime Minister hiked taxes again on groceries, he ignored Canadians who are begging for relief and he turned a deaf ear to premiers across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559178">Despite the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation>'s recent claim that he opposed the carbon tax because of the burden it places on workers, Canadians know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> hiked the carbon tax with the enthusiastic support of his NDP partner. In fact, NDP members voted for the carbon tax at least 24 times in this place. They are every bit as responsible as the Prime Minister for adding to the cost of fuel, groceries, home heating and just about every necessity that Canadians need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559179">The NDP-Liberal carbon tax is punishing Canadians for going to work, taxing moms and dads for driving their kids to hockey or to dance classes, penalizing the seniors who are on fixed incomes for eating a nutritious meal and diving deep into the pockets of Canadians for simply trying to stay warm in the winter. Punishing Canadians for life's basic necessities is cruel and it does nothing to safeguard the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559180">The costly carbon tax is even more punishing in my province of Saskatchewan. When people live in a rural or small community, public transit simply is not an option. They simply have to drive further distances to get to work or to simply go to school. The reality is that people are going to drive a little further to get groceries or prescriptions, never mind a doctor or specialist appointment that could literally be hours away. When temperatures dip to -50C, heat is not a luxury; it is a necessity. That is the lived experience in Saskatchewan and for so many rural Canadians across the country. It is a reality that the government conveniently ignores time and time again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559181">Just like how the Liberal-NDP government pretends that Canadians are somehow better off because of its punishing carbon tax, it conveniently ignores all the evidence around it, including reports from the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. In fact, we learned last spring that the government hid its own reports to that effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559182"> The PBO has been clear that most families will pay more in carbon tax than they get back in rebates.

We will cut the carbon tax that is adding to the cost of everything for Canadians. The Conservatives will bring home lower prices so that Canadians can reap the rewards of their hard work. We will remove the gatekeepers who have slowed housing construction.

Despite their desperation to try to distance themselves from the terrible record of the Prime Minister, which, to be clear, is equally their own record, having voted hand in hand with the Liberal government for its failed policies and activist-driven agenda, the NDP is once again failing to be the opposition party that it was elected to be.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559209">Mr. Speaker, “It was all a dream”, as Biggie Smalls once said, and he laid out a vision of his own experience of growing up with absolutely nothing, putting in hard work with determination, being raised by a single mom and making something of himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559210">Similarly, that is what the Canadian dream used to be. That is something my family and millions of other Canadians came here for. Canada used to be the kind of country where if people put in hard work, did the right things and played by the rules, they could afford a house and groceries. Most importantly, people could buy a house in a safe neighbourhood. That is what Canada used to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559211">However, after nine years of the corrupt Liberal-NDP government, that Canadian dream is broken. It is gone. In fact, for most of the people who are coming here, that Canadian dream is the Canadian nightmare, with drugs, chaos, crime, disorder and extortion running rampant because of failed soft-on-crime policies. The Liberal-NDP government doubled housing costs, increased the cost of groceries and forced two million Canadians to use food banks. For the first time I have ever heard of, one in four Canadians are skipping meals, and that includes children. That is what failed Liberal-NDP policies have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559212">The Liberals did it for votes. They spent more money and put more debt on taxpayers than every single prime minister before them combined. That caused the inflation crisis. That caused the pain and suffering we are seeing in Canadians today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559213"> If anyone thinks this is some accident or, oops, the Liberals did not know what they were doing, it is actually the opposite. They knew exactly what they were doing. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who is known as a narcissist, wants to play God all the time. He causes the problem and then wants to look like the saviour who will fix the problem. Canadians know it is the Liberal-NDP government that has caused this suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559214"> Housing used to be affordable and did not take up more than 50% of a paycheque. After nine years of the government, now it takes 60% to 80% of a paycheque. That does not leave much at the end of the month. That paycheque is not as powerful. Then when people go to the grocery store or to fill up the gas tank, because of the carbon tax scam, more and more is being taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559215">It has gotten to a point where Canadians now have the most indebted households in the entire G7. Housing, and everything else, is up under the government because of its inflationary policies. That is why we are now seeing business and personal insolvencies skyrocketing like we have never seen before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559216">If we listen to the Liberal-NDP government, everything is fine. It does not bother the government that two million Canadians are visiting a food bank. There is talk about extravagant things all the time. It is because the government is not talking to any of those two million waiting in a food bank, those who are insolvent or those who have to skip meals. The government is not talking to any of them. It is only talking to Liberal insiders, rewarding them with hefty government contracts. Those are the only people that the Liberal-NDP government is talking to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559217">This costly coalition has taxed the middle class to death. It is not just the carbon tax scam, which, again, is a total scam that does not stop a single forest fire or flood and also does not reduce emissions, but on top of that, it takes more money out of the pockets of Canadians than what they get back. That is why it is a scam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559218">Not only is the middle class getting hit with that, but there is a second carbon tax scam where there is no so-called rebate at all, which makes things even more expensive. The government has hiked taxes and has now brought in this job-killing capital gains tax hike that for many families is a punishment for their life's entire work and success. For example, the plumber who opened their own business, working sometimes 12 to 16 hours a day, saving dollars, putting their kids through college or university, barely making it through and sometimes not paying themselves so they could pay their employees, might have done what is now a punishment. They might have saved up to buy a plaza for their retirement later on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559219"> However, the government thought that was too greedy of people, that they would do too well. Now the government is going to punish them with this job-killing capital gains tax hike. These people did everything by the rules. They have suffered through the current government and they know now that success is punished in this country. Liberals do not even let people enjoy drinks because they keep raising the escalator tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559220">The economic pain and destruction is unbelievable. In fact, $460 billion of Canadian investment fled to the U.S. That means it went to American workers, American infrastructure and American pipelines when it should have stayed right here at home. It is because of the failed Liberal-NDP policies that that happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559221">I recall seeing headlines in 2014, under a strong, common-sense Conservative government, that said the American dream had moved to Canada. Just recently, the Toronto Star came out with an article that said the Canadian dream is gone and has fled to the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559222">That is nine years of economic vandalism by the Liberal-NDP government. It has over-regulated, overburdened and over-red-taped Canada, and “over-bureaucracy” is the theme of the government, so much so that no one wants to build anything here, manufacture anything here or, in fact, live here anymore. That is what the government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559223">Hundreds of thousands of bright people are leaving our country because they see no hope here. Canada used to look like the beacon of hope. It used to be a place people would talk about and say they could not wait to move to. Now Canada has become not only a laughingstock because of its joke of a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> but a place where, when they move here, people say the promise that they could work hard and get somewhere was a lie all along. It is because the government will do anything and everything to attack hard work, a powerful paycheque and, most important, success. It does not want anyone to be successful, unless they are Liberal connected insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559224">It is clear that Canadians are getting poorer and their paycheques do not go as far. Our GDP per person, or the success of an individual who lives here, is diminishing quarter after quarter. The government says things are great here, but Canadians, especially our workers, are falling further behind than their American counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559225">However, it is time now. Canadians have had enough. They are calling for a carbon tax election now. It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> to put the greed for his $2.2-million pension aside, and it is time to go to an election to give Canadians the choice. Rather than having the Liberal-NDP government and its radical, wacko ideology of this carbon tax scam that it is absolutely obsessed with, we should put it to Canadians. We already know a majority of them do not want this carbon tax scam. Why do we not leave it to Canadians to decide whether they want more of their food, success and fuel taxed under the costly coalition, or a common-sense Conservative government under the leadership of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559226">Conservatives will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.

The simple message I am getting, whether someone has lived here their whole life or moved here, is that Canada is not Canada anymore. It is not the Canada we used to know. After nine years of the government punishing our paycheques, punishing us for success and punishing us for our hard work, Canada has become a place where nobody wants to live anymore.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559254">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege to be here today to speak on behalf of the people who sent me to represent them in the House of Commons, the people of London West.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559255">This morning, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> said that if the Conservatives formed government, they would run things the way they did before, specifically referring to when Harper's Conservatives were in power. That is a big shame. After all, this Conservative Party has promised to create barbaric cultural practices such as hotlines that encourage Canadians to spy on one another. It was this Conservative Party that kept families apart through limited family reunification targets, only because it did not want to let many seniors into this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559256"> Yesterday, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation> spent time filibustering a bill that was first moved by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278444" Type="2">Brandon—Souris</Affiliation>, who was the sponsor of the bill. He said the Conservatives would make sure they did not oppose the motion, yet they spent three hours filibustering it, misleading Canadians and not following the promises they made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559257">It was this Conservative Party that introduced significant cuts to the interim federal health program in 2012, which provided health care to refugees and asylum seekers. These cuts led to limited access to central health services for many refugees, including children and pregnant women. The Federal Court eventually ruled that these cuts were cruel and unusual. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559258">It was this Conservative Party that voted against funding the interim housing assistance program ahead of the cold winter months, playing political games, as they have done since we came back to Parliament, with the lives of vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers, again misleading Canadians that they are here to serve. They are here to cut programs that are vital and essential to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559259">It was this Conservative Party that shut down the family reunification program for two years, separating families. In fact, a statement made by the former immigration minister under the Harper Conservatives said, “If you think your parents may need to go on welfare in Canada, please don't sponsor them.” This was from a minister in Harper's government. It was the same Conservative Party that accused vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees of abusing Canada's generosity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559260">The Conservatives are doing what they know best, and that is dividing and misleading Canadians. Shame on them. We will not stand for it, nor will we dignify their shameful tactics to divide Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559261">Let us talk about what the Conservative Party is doing right now at the citizenship and immigration committee. I want to remind the House what the Conservatives said about Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>, an act to amend the Citizenship Act, during second reading debate. There has been a six-hour filibuster on a motion at the immigration committee regarding Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559262">I will take this opportunity to share that I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278762" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation>. I got carried away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559263">I would like to share some of the context on Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>. Given the recent legal changes to the first-generation limit that Harper's Conservatives introduced, it was clear that changes were needed to the Citizenship Act to address cohorts of excluded citizens. This is especially relevant for those born outside of Canada to a Canadian parent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559264">In 2009, several amendments to the Citizenship Act remedied the majority of the older lost Canadian cases by providing and restoring citizenship and removing the need for anyone to file to retain their citizenship by their 28th birthday. However, the Harper Conservatives introduced the first-generation limit, which the Supreme Court of Ontario has now deemed unconstitutional based on equality and mobility rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559265">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="2">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has suggested that he would use the notwithstanding clause if given the chance, and that the Conservatives are considering taking away people's rights when it suits them. What the Conservatives did here is a concrete example of taking away the rights of Canadians, and I think they will do it again if given the opportunity. When Conservatives say that Canadians have nothing to fear, Canadians need to take note of what they have done in the past, as they have repeatedly said they would run the system exactly how they did before.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559266">Bill <Document DbId="11777172" Type="4">S-245</Document>, a Senate public bill on the lost Canadians issue, was sponsored by a Conservative senator. However, during the study on this bill, the Conservative Party filibustered for over 30 hours. During that time, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation>, who is the sponsor for Bill <Document DbId="11777172" Type="4">S-245</Document> and the former Conservative immigration critic, recommended the introduction of a private member's bill or government bill to address the remaining cohort of lost Canadians. I want to point out that the Conservative Party continues to trade down this bill, even though it corresponds with its <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, who has assured us that the Conservatives will continue to support and advocate for this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559267">As I said earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation> was quoted as saying that they will make sure there is no opposition to it, yet yesterday, the Conservatives spent hours filibustering, with different colleagues in rotation coming to filibuster. It was very misleading that they told Canadians there would be no opposition and it would be passed quickly. These Canadians came to our committee. The Conservatives listened to witnesses and heard them, yet they still misled them and moved into a filibuster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559268"> We have a government bill in front of us that we want to pass. It is wrong that the Harper Conservatives created this division in the first place. However, once again, the Conservative Party is playing political games with the lives of Canadians. Nothing about that is new. They have done it before and are doing it again. I hope Canadians are watching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559269"> The Conservatives are delaying Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document> from going to committee so it can be debated. They are also filibustering at the immigration committee regarding the motion on Bill C-71. I am so disappointed that the Conservatives have been sharing misinformation and attempting to stoke division and drive fear into the hearts of Canadians, but I cannot say that I am surprised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559270"> The Conservatives constantly talk about people's pensions. They talk about the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation>'s pension, yet they do not talk about the fact that their own <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has a pension of $230,000. The Conservatives also do not want to address why their leader does not have a security clearance right now. These are all questions that Canadians need answers to, and Conservatives should be asking them themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559271">On this side of the House, we remain committed to righting the wrongs of the unconstitutional first-generation limit on families. We continue to support newcomers. We will continue to provide a safe haven for vulnerable asylum seekers, all the while ensuring that our growth is sustainable and that we continue to build more homes and grow our economy. We have prioritized family reunification by expanding the spousal, parents and grandparents sponsorship program, increasing our annual levels and lowering financial requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559272"> We are taking action to restore the integrity of the international student program, protecting students from instances of abuse and exploitation. We have made it easier for foreign national physicians with job opportunities to remain here in Canada and seek permanent residency. We have also launched a health-specific category under express entry to help address labour shortages in the health care sector so that Canadians can receive the quality health care they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559273"> We introduced the home child care provider pilot and home support worker pilot to provide pathways to PR for caregivers. We are also the first country to introduce a special humanitarian stream for women leaders, human rights defenders, LGBTQI+ individuals, persecuted minorities and journalists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559274">On this side of the House, we will always support newcomers, asylum seekers, refugees and citizens, and we will always stand shoulder to shoulder with them every step of the way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559528">Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the Liberal price of pollution. We now learn that taxpayers were hit up for $1,200 per household to get the TMX boondoggle built. That is a direct subsidy from Canadians' pockets to Suncor, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the “sunny ways” man, is responsible for the biggest increases in oil production and emissions in history. No wonder Richie Rich Kruger from Suncor says the sun is shining on the tar sands, sunny ways while our planet burns.</ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> said, “as New Democrats, as progressives, as environmentalists, we are in favour of putting a price on pollution.” I guess they are no longer progressive or environmentalists.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559543">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to today's opposition day motion on behalf of the residents of my amazing riding of Davenport, in downtown west Toronto. It is not a surprise that I will not be supporting this motion when it comes to a vote. I want to talk about the work the Liberals are doing to strengthen the economy here in Canada and, more specifically, the investments we are making in artificial intelligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559544">Today, I rise to highlight this government's achievements on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has incredible potential to transform the economy, improve the way we work and enhance our way of life. Over the last several years, our federal government has taken a number of actions to support our world-class researchers and innovators to ensure that Canada remains at the forefront of developing and adopting safe and responsible artificial intelligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559545">When it comes to artificial intelligence, Canada has been ahead of the curve for many years. In 2017, Canada was the first country to launch a fully funded national AI strategy. Through the pan-Canadian AI strategy, we have helped build a vibrant AI ecosystem in Canada by working with key partners such as the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; the three national AI institutes based across this country in Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto; and Canada's five global innovation clusters to build a base of world-class talent in AI, to advance research excellence and to drive the responsible adoption of AI across Canada's economy and society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559546">Through the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research AI chairs program, we have recruited over 120 of the best and brightest AI researchers in the world. These researchers are advancing research in a range of key areas such as science, health, energy and the environment. We are also training a strong cohort of next-generation AI leaders. Through the second phase of this strategy, we are building a strong research base with programs that are enabling AI commercialization and adoption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559547">The investments made by our federal government of over $440 million under the strategy have resulted in a research and talent ecosystem that is the envy of the world. We are seeing the positive economic impacts of investments in the growing number of AI start-ups and scale-ups across Canada that are taking world-leading positions in their fields. Canada now ranks among leading nations on the global AI index, as well as in start-up AI activity, venture capital investment in AI companies, talent growth and research publications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559548">Furthermore, in 2018, the federal government launched the global innovation clusters program, including Canada's AI-powered supply chains cluster, Scale AI, representing an ambitious co-investment with industry. Scale AI is creating collaborations across the country to promote intellectual property creation and commercialization and to ensure that Canada's AI business ecosystem remains one of the most vibrant in the world.</ParaText>

I believe we are talking about confidence in this government, and I would say that I have enormous confidence in our government. I am giving the member examples of why I have so much confidence in it and am talking about our AI strategy. I see all of this as very relevant and I am going to continue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559555">In 2018, the government launched the global innovation cluster program. This program is an ambitious coinvestment with industry that will create collaborations across the country to promote intellectual property creation and commercialization and to ensure that we have a very strong AI business ecosystem that will remain the most vibrant in the world. I believe we have a lot of work to do to create a culture of IP here in Canada, and we need to continue to invest very strongly in IP education and make sure we are patenting and trademarking the unbelievable ideas created here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559556">Going back to Canada's AI, to date, Scale AI has announced 151 projects representing a total coinvestment of $610 million. These projects have helped Canadian start-ups launch new products, find partners and grow. Scale AI has supported many Canadian AI successes, such as Routific in B.C. and AlayaCare in Montreal. With many more projects under way, Scale AI will continue to deliver on the promise of advancing AI innovation and driving economic growth across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559557"> As our domestic AI capacity has grown, Canada has leveraged this to shape global norms on AI. With France, we developed and launched the Global AI Partnership on AI in 2020, which is now the premier forum where countries can collaborate and advance the development of AI for good and for all. With allies in the Council of Europe, we developed the first binding treaty to ensure the respect of human rights, the rule of law and democracy in the use of AI. With G7 allies, Canada has developed cutting-edge principles and best practices for responsible AI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559558">This experience allowed Canada to be an early mover in developing clearer rules for developing and operating AI systems. In 2022, our <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation</Affiliation> tabled Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which included a component entitled the artificial intelligence and data act. If passed, it will make a new law aimed at ensuring proper risk management and transparency for AI systems in order to promote trust. This act would ensure that firms developing or deploying AI systems play critical roles in the lives of Canadians, such as those determining access to credit or employment, and that they meet the minimum standards for transparency, assessment and mitigation of risk. This will ensure that Canadians can trust these systems to operate safely and fairly. The act would also create a new regulator, the artificial intelligence and data commissioner, to oversee compliance, with strong penalties for non-compliance. Canada was one of the first countries in the world to introduce comprehensive AI legislation, and many other countries are now going down the same path and following our leadership. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559559">With the advances of generative AI that took place in 2022 and 2023, our federal government took action to ensure that businesses have the tools they need to adopt advanced AI in a trustworthy and responsible manner. Our government introduced a voluntary code of conduct on advanced generative AI. This code is voluntary, and those who sign on to it commit to set in place concrete measures, which include expectations for AI transparency, safety, accountability and testing. To date, 30 organizations have signed on to the code, and we expect more signatories in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559560"> Most recently, our government continued its leadership in this space through budget 2024, which announced an ambitious package of measures totalling $2.4 billion over five years, starting in 2024-25, to secure Canada's AI advantage. This includes $2 billion in funding for a new AI compute access fund and an AI sovereign compute strategy, $200 million to support the adoption of AI across Canada's economy and $100 million to support small and medium-sized enterprises that are seeking to develop and scale their AI product offerings. </ParaText>

What we are doing now is doubling down on investments in compute and adoption and upscaling to make sure Canada remains at the forefront of the AI revolution. We are proud of the work we have done to support Canada's AI ecosystem and proud of the work we are doing to protect Canadians as we enter into the digital and AI-enabled age.</ParaText>

We have lowered taxes for the middle class and those working hard to achieve it. We have introduced a dental care plan. We have introduced a national child care plan. We have introduced a number of programs to help support Canadians through this process. The only question I have is why Conservatives have voted against each one of those programs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559573">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by mentioning that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278243" Type="2">Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston</Affiliation>. I am here today to speak about our non-confidence motion regarding this Prime Minister and this government. It is often said that memory is not infallible. What we know today, thanks to our short-term memory, is that this government, with the help of the Bloc Québécois, has doubled the country's debt, doubled the cost of housing, caused the worst inflation in 40 years, sent two million people to food banks, and unleashed a wave of crime and chaos in our communities. That is today's reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559574">I think we need a reminder, a refresher on this government's legacy over the past nine years. There are reasons why we say “nine years with this Prime Minister” or “nine years with this government”. I want to talk about the current legacy of scandals surrounding the Prime Minister. The list is long. I hope I will have enough time to get through it all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559575">For starters, we remember the infamous trip to the Aga Khan's island; that was a controversial trip. There was even a report from the Ethics Commissioner, who found the Prime Minister guilty of ethical breaches. Then there is the former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, a woman of integrity who wanted to do her job but was sidelined because she would not help SNC-Lavalin circumvent the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559576">There was the WE Charity scandal. Everyone remembers WE, and if they do not, that is exactly why we need to talk about it again. Some $900 million was spent via this company for gatherings of some kind. Money was also paid out to relatives. I am talking about the Prime Minister's mother and brother. I could go on and on about that scandal, but today I simply want to refresh everyone's memory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559577">Let us talk about management of the pandemic. What did Canada do? In a truly baffling decision, we took our stockpile of masks and personal protective equipment and sent it to China. What happened a few weeks later? The virus entered Canada, and we were out of equipment because it had all been sent to China. That is the kind of utterly ridiculous decision that was made. Meanwhile, contracts were being signed. Because there was a pandemic, things had to be done. Party insiders close to the regime were rubbing their hands in glee, including former MP Frank Baylis, who owned a company and announced that he could provide 10,000 ventilators for $230 million. Someone looked at that, scratched their head and thought that 10,000 ventilators seemed like a lot, that maybe we did not need that many and that it would have cost $130 million on the market. Overpaying by $100 million is not insignificant. He was a party insider, however. We dug a little deeper and tried to figure things out at committee, but we were not able to truly get to the bottom of this. In hindsight, we know that it made no sense whatsoever. To make matters worse, I was recently told that these 10,000 machines have been thrown in the garbage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559578">Last spring, there was the McKinsey affair. Dominic Barton and friends of the Prime Minister and the Liberal regime were suddenly awarded contracts worth over $120 million. Contracts were awarded to McKinsey for consulting. Once again, in committee, we dug a little deeper to get the information. We all know that those contracts did not make any sense, but it is difficult to press charges. However, Canadians should remember that these things happened and that there are still a lot of unanswered questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559579">With respect to the Governor General issue, the appointment of Ms. Payette was a total fiasco. Everyone knows that things went completely off the rails there. She spent money frivolously. Victims had to be compensated. In our opinion, that appointment and that mindset are representative of the Prime Minister's legacy. In 2021, the current <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs</Affiliation> admitted that the “Payette fiasco shows the need for a stronger GG vetting process”. What did the Prime Minister immediately do to replace Ms. Payette? He appointed a Governor General who does not speak French, one of the official languages. I think that we need to repeat that often: Our official languages are English and French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559580">That was another really stupid decision on the part of this government. The Liberals had the opportunity to appoint a new governor general and they chose a unilingual anglophone. Let us also remember our Prime Minister's much-talked-about trip to India in 2018. What a fiasco that was. It was totally ridiculous. He was wearing costumes. He made us the laughingstock of the country, but things got even worse from there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559581">When he attended an official protocol activity in India, there was a terrorist in his group. That terrorist had been invited by a former MP who is no longer here today, fortunately. That terrorist was a guest of Canada. That is quite something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559582">We know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to dress up. Even before he became Prime Minister, he often wore racist costumes. He did it so often that he does not even remember how many times he did it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559583">I want to come back to the financial scandals. Recently, there was the ArriveCAN scandal, the famous app that should have cost $80,000. Experts said they could develop that app in a weekend. In the end, it cost us taxpayers $60 million and counting. That is another scandal. As I was saying at the start, it has been nine years of scandals. Some apparently end up being forgotten. That is why today, when we talk about how this is the situation after nine years, we add this all up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559584">I will move on to the partisan judicial appointments. That is a sensitive topic. The fact remains that it is common knowledge that six sitting superior court judges paid to have drinks with the Prime Minister or the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> just before being appointed to the bench. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559585">Let us get back to the trips. There was the Prime Minister's vacation at the home of the Aga Khan, and after that, there was his Jamaican holiday. The Prime Minister travelled to Jamaica with his family, and his team told the media that he was paying all of his own expenses. We know that the airplane is a must for security reasons. No one needs to tell me that. I know. As for the rest, however, when people decide to stay at a big villa and all that, they should pay for it themselves, not with taxpayer dollars. The Prime Minister's Office said that he paid for all of his expenses, but we later learned that he had not paid a cent, that he had been invited by another billionaire friend to stay at his home with his family and his entourage. Why not tell Canadians the truth? Why play all the angles all the time?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559586">We agree that the Prime Minister is entitled to take a vacation with his family. There was a time when politicians could not go on vacation without being perceived as people who do no work. We agree that taking two or three weeks of vacation a year is normal. However, when prime ministers Chrétien, Martin, Mulroney and Harper took vacations, why did they not go to billionaires' islands, to the residences of other millionaires or billionaires or to Jamaica? They were happy with reasonable vacations. Why is this not important to the Prime Minister? He hops on the government jet and flies off to island paradises with no regard for Canadians. It is all sorts of things like that that led us to realize that we can no longer have confidence in someone who thinks that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559587">More money was spent at Harrington Lake. The government decided to spend up to $11 million to renovate the facilities at Harrington Lake, to move the guest house closer to the lake. The Prime Minister never goes there, though, so why invest $11 million to move a guest house closer to the lake?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559588">I will talk about other contracts and other weird decisions. Once again, these are sensitive issues. I need to point out that public money was used to hire consultants who are frankly racist. For example, Laith Marouf, who was known to be a raging anti-Semite, received $500,000 from the government for work on racism. Why hire someone who is already known as a racist to do work that does not reflect his mandate? Another crazy decision was to hire Amira Elghawaby to build bridges. Before she was hired, we already knew that she was making racist comments about Quebeckers, among others. Now that she has been appointed, she continues to create disruption instead of building bridges. Why did they hire her, and why do they not fire her now?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559589">I mentioned all these scandals to refresh everyone's memory, but let us not forget that, in today's economy, young people cannot even hope to own a home. Construction is at the same level as in the 1970s. An additional $500 billion in budgetary allocations were adopted, unfortunately with the support of the Bloc Québécois. Canada has the worst growth in the G7. The Prime Minister and his government have spent more than all other prime ministers in Canadian history combined.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559609">About ten days after that, on March 24, it came back in an emergency session with the government's goal of passing a piece of legislation, which at that point had not been shared with the House of Commons, that would give the government, among other things, the power to suspend the House for a year and a half. Supply would be guaranteed to the government for over a year, until December 2021. The government would have the ability to pass new laws by regulations, which is known as a Henry VIII clause because Henry VIII did something similar in his reign 500-odd years ago. We would have seen the suspension of the system we call responsible government, in which the government of the day is responsible to the House of Commons, for a year and a half. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559610">Those of us who were members of Parliament at that time were told to stay home, that it was too dangerous to come to Ottawa and we would be risking our own safety and the safety of others. A series of preposterous arguments was presented as to why we could not meet and how it would be dangerous. We could, of course, have met at the convention centre and been widely spaced; no trade shows were on at the time. </ParaText>

As it turned out, that was not necessary because a number of my Conservative colleagues came here with the same intention, and that attempt to suspend responsible government was stopped. The House of Commons' ability to bring down the government, which would have been pushed through, was stopped. </ParaText>

This system started with a non-confidence vote that took place on November 15, 1830, in the Parliament of Westminster. That vote brought down the administration of the Duke of Wellington, the same Duke of Wellington who defeated Napoleon. The non-confidence vote of April 7, 1835, reinforced that principle, bringing down the government of Sir Robert Peel. This model was emulated in the province of Canada by Baldwin and LaFontaine in the 1840s and also in Nova Scotia, which became the very first jurisdiction in the world, other than the United Kingdom itself, to achieve responsible government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559617">I want to be clear about this. Through the ability to bring forward motions of confidence, or non-confidence, in the government of the day, responsible government was all about establishing whether the government of the day could or could not command a majority of votes in the elected lower House of Parliament or the legislature.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559629">In 2005, Paul Martin's government was brought down by a motion that simply stated, “That this House has lost confidence in the government.” Today's motion, in that tradition, says simply, “That the House has no confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559630">There is a sense in which the current government has not had the confidence of the Canadian people for some time.

              <ParaText id="8559631">The current government was elected in 2019 with 33.12% of the vote and in 2021 with only 32.62% of the vote. More than two-thirds of Canadians voted against the current government at that time. This is really bad. In 1958, the year of John Diefenbaker's colossal victory over the Liberals, do members know that the Liberals, who were defeated in their worst defeat ever up to that point in time, had 33.75% of the vote? They got more votes as a percentage than the current government received in either of the last two elections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559632">What is even more amazing is that when we take into account the percentage of people who actually participated, which was 79% back in 1958 and only 62% in the last election, we learn that the Liberals in 1958, in that colossal defeat, had 26.6% of all eligible voters, whereas only 20.3% of eligible voters voted for the current government. There is a real sense in which the government has not had the support of the Canadian people for some time, and we can see why, based on its phenomenal record of incompetence.</ParaText>

That was actually Stephen Harper's government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559635"> The member did not make reference to it, but Stephen Harper determined that he would prorogue the House to prevent a vote of non-confidence.

On March 24, 2020, hoping that we would be in a panic, the government tried to get unanimous consent to push through a provision. This would have given it the power to avoid facing a confidence vote in the House for a little over year and a half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559639">When the opposition showed some backbone, the government was forced to move to a normal process and to have some give-and-take. The Conservatives spent all day going back and forth, working on adjustments, and the provision was removed from the legislation. To be clear, it was done because the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could not get away with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559640">With regard to the issue of Stephen Harper proroguing to avoid a confidence vote, the member is almost right. In 2008, shortly after the election, there was a move to bring down the government. The House was prorogued, and it came back; the opposition could then have brought down the government, had it so chosen. What it did instead was to propose an arrangement under which the government would spend a certain amount of money on infrastructure in order to deal with the 2008 economic crisis, and there would be periodic reviews of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559641"> At any of those review points, the government could have been brought down on a confidence motion. Indeed, that was built into the structure of the deal. All the parties participated, and if the member has a problem with that, he should go back and consult with the members of his party who were present.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559653">I am speaking today on an important topic that the opposition has brought forward, and I will start by saying that Canadians have been through a lot over the last several years. To put that in context, Canadians have gone through a global pandemic. This was a once-in-a-lifetime event, a once-in-100-years event; obviously, it took a toll on Canadians. A massive component of our economy was frozen; kids needed to stay home from school, and businesses were shut. However, our government was there to support Canadians, Canadian workers and Canadian businesses. Yes, we invested in them during this time. We did this to ensure that, when the pandemic finished, the Canadian economy would exit the downturn it caused and people would get back to work. This is exactly what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559654"> Of course, after the pandemic, we had the war in Ukraine. It was the first time in 80 years that war was brought back to Europe. There were supply chain snarls and, with them, global inflation. We saw inflation take effect across the world because of supply chain bottlenecks; the demand that was created during the pandemic, when everyone was stuck at home, and subsequent to it; and, of course, geopolitics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559655">In the Canadian economy, we are now at a point where, inflation has returned to 2%, the bank's target range. Interest rates are coming down, and we saw the Bank of Canada cut 75 basis points today. The governor indicated that further potential cuts will come down the road. My personal opinion, as an economist, is that the Bank of Canada will continue cutting rates through this next series of meetings. If I had to provide a forecast, it would probably be between an additional 150 to 225 basis points, but probably near the 200 basis-point range.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559656">Where does this leave Canadians? We know that Canadians have endured a lot with global inflation, COVID, wars going on and uncertainty in the world. However, we have had the backs of Canadians, and we will continue to do so. Why is that? It is because we have put in place transformational pillars to strengthen our social safety net; create the conditions for economic growth, wealth creation and job creation; and move the country forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559657">When I think about the Canada child benefit, which we put in place in 2015, it now sends nearly $30 billion in tax-free monthly payments to families across the country. This includes over $100 million in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge. It is helping tens of thousands of kids in my riding, lifting almost 400,000 kids out of poverty, and we are no longer sending checks to millionaires. These are substantive measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559658">I think of the national early learning and day care plan; in the province of Ontario, fees have been reduced by 52.7%. Working in collaboration with the Progressive Conservative government in Ontario, we will see $10-a-day day care, on average, by September 2025. We know it is working because my daughter is in day care, and we have seen a reduction. Our family, who is blessed with much, has seen over $10,000 in after-tax savings. I have much gratitude for our blessings. Those are real savings for families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559659">We have also introduced the Canadian dental care plan, and 750,000 Canadians who could not afford to access a dentist have now gone to one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559660">These are measures that help Canadians. However, we must now create the economic conditions to ensure that we can afford these generous programs, such as increasing old age security by 10% to over three million Canadian seniors aged 75-plus. This made a real difference in the pockets of Canadian seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559661">We know the opposite party has a notion of what Canada is, but I have my own notion, and so I will disagree with them. Despite some of the headwinds we have faced, I like to refer to this decade as Canada's decade. I believe that Canada is the best country in the world. It is not because we are perfect. We are a work-in-progress. However, I know that there are millions of people who would move here tomorrow morning, and I would rather not live anywhere else. I like to vacation in other places, where it may be sunny, but this is the best country. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559662">When we think about what we have put in place as a government, working with unions and industry, we can say that this is Canada's decade. Yes, interest rates are descending. Consumer confidence in Canada has hit a 29-month high, according to Bloomberg-Nanos. I think about our strategic investments in artificial intelligence, in electric vehicles, in critical minerals and in the supply chain for electric vehicles. BloombergNEF has rated us the number one country in the world. Depending on the year, it can be number two versus China, but we are number one. I think of our investments in Canadians and in learning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559663">We put all those measures in place, working with the provinces on our electricity system for a competitive advantage, in the sense that almost 90% of Canada's electricity system is green. We are working with companies in Alberta, such as Dow Chemical, with a $10-billion investment, or Linde, with a $2-billion investment. We are supporting Atlantic Canadians, ensuring that electricity rates remain low to be competitive and attract industry. This is truly Canada's decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559664">Looking around the world, we can say that we have what the world wants. We have the energy, the natural resources and the human capital. I am looking at the sectors around the world and what we have, whether it is Alberta and the advantage on feedstock, British Columbia and the human capital that is powering that province forward in its film industry or here in Ontario and the electric vehicle sector or the fintech sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559665">I am looking at the province of Quebec and the aerospace industry, which transcends industry in many parts of the country. We have what the world wants, and we are doing things in such a way that our fiscal finances and our budget are the envy of the world. We have a 1% deficit-to-GDP ratio. The United States and the European countries have a 7% deficit-to-GDP ratio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559666">We have a AAA credit rating. It matters. Our borrowing rates are actually lower than those of most of the G7 countries, if not the lowest. Yes, we have challenges. We absolutely have issues. Canadians know that. That is what governing is about: taking on tough challenges. We will continue to do that, but this is fundamentally Canada's decade. I truly believe that. As we go forward, we are projected to lead economic growth in 2025 in the G7. Our finances are probably the best, if not the best, in the G20.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559667"> I think of the programs we put in place: The Canada child benefit is helping millions of kids and families and lifting kids out of poverty; through the national early learning and day care plan, we have seen a 53% price reduction. We are the funding partner, and then the Progressive Conservative government in Ontario actually operates the program in my region and through York Region. I speak to day care operators in the province of Ontario, and they say the demand for day care spots has gone up. Therefore, we have responsibly said that we will provide those loans, incentives and grants for day care operators to expand spaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559668">In terms of the dental care plan, over 8,000 residents in my riding have now been approved for dental care. I do not think any government wants to take away dental care from seniors and vulnerable Canadians. Does anyone? I do not think any government will take away the national day care and early learning program from any other government. Quebec has had it for many years. Would any party in this room, in the House, go to the Province of Quebec and say that they have to remove their early learning and day care plan? I do not think so, or I would love to hear from the opposite aisle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559669">This is Canada's decade on the economy, on our social programs and on making this truly what we call inclusive economic growth. We will absolutely see those flowers bloom. Inflation is at 2%. Rates are coming down. Consumer confidence is increasing. It is going to take time, but we are there.</ParaText>

For the past hours, my colleagues have talked about many aspects of why it has been Canada's decade on the economic front, the environmental front or the social front. However, there is another dimension as to why this is Canada's decade, and it was not like that a decade before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559690">It is truly an honour to rise in the House today to speak about our government's accomplishments and the important work that we are doing and continue to do each and every day. Let me take a moment to reflect on the aspect I was referring to, which is the progress made on the path to reconciliation. The work that our government has done on that should also be recognized as to why it is Canada's decade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559691">Let us remember where we were in 2015. After a decade of Harper and the Conservatives in power, the state of the relationship between Canada and indigenous people was extremely tense. We will remember Idle No More, when indigenous people and Canadians joined together to protest across the country because Stephen Harper refused to listen to them. The courts had already ruled that the Conservatives had continued the systematic underfunding of first nations communities when it came to critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants. Is it any surprise that there were 105 long-term drinking water advisories in place by the end of their mandate a decade ago? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559692">We might say this is in the past, that the old Conservative Party was different, but let us remember that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was not only a member of that government but also the minister responsible for housing in that government, and his record speaks for itself. The number was six. As well, from 2011 to 2015, the Harper government did not make a single new investment in first nations housing, and the Conservative leader's $300-million boondoggle first nations housing program only managed to build 99 homes on reserves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559693">Let us remember the colonial and oppressive policies of the Conservative government that devastated communities by separating children from their families and culture for generations. Let us remember the disproportionate violence that the indigenous women and girls experienced, and continue to experience to this day. In 2015, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to transform this relationship. The Prime Minister said that no relationship is more important than a relationship with indigenous people. We have seen the proof of that over the last 10 years, and we have been working very hard ever since to honour our commitment to the path of reconciliation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559694">Allow me to cover some of the aspects that we have been focusing on. I will start with expanding our housing initiative. We are the first government to work side by side with indigenous partners to assess the scope and scale of housing and infrastructure needs on reserves. Co-developing a 10-year housing and infrastructure strategy is our government's priority. Following the lead of the partners, we have supported the construction, renovation and retrofit of more than 36,000 homes in first nations communities, as well as 9,000 infrastructure projects, to ensure families are housed safely. We are creating tangible, lasting, indigenous-led solutions to close the gap and build strong, healthy communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559695">What is also crucial in building strong, healthy communities is long-term access to clean water. I said earlier that, in 2015, we started with 105 advisories. Water is life, and everyone needs equitable access to clean water free from pollution. Since 2015, we have supported first nations drinking water infrastructure and operation. As a result, first nations received on average over three times more annual funding for water and waste-water systems compared to the previous Conservative government. If members want numbers, it is $492 million versus $162 million. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559696">Now, 95% of communities do not have a long-term advisories. We have helped lift 145 long-term drinking water advisories and prevented over 275 short-term advisories from becoming long term. There is also a plan and project team in place working toward a lift in 30 communities with remaining long-term drinking water advisories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559697"> After years of collaboration with first nations partners, we have introduced the first nations clean water act to hold government accountable for investing what is needed in water infrastructure, creating the tools first nations need to manage their own water systems and protecting the lakes and rivers they draw their water from to ensure first nations have clean drinking water for generations to come. Now we are listening to all perspectives from first nations partners at the committee on how to improve the bill. I hope all parties will support this important legislation and ensure it goes through the parliamentary process without any delay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559698">Another aspect that I would like to highlight is our advancement in child and family services. We vowed to do the hard but important work to address the harmful impacts of child and welfare systems on first nations, Inuit and Métis communities. Bill <Document DbId="10344307" Type="3">C-92</Document> became law on January 1, 2020, and it clearly affirms that indigenous people have the right to decide what is best for their children, families and communities. We continue to work with several communities and provincial governments to restore these inherent rights and ensure continued long-term funding for child and family services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559699">Just two weeks ago, the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> joined the GNN to sign a coordination agreement that affirms its jurisdiction over child and family services. This is the 10th community to reign control over their own child and family services, with more on the way. This is a pivotal moment for reconciliation. We are closer than ever to shifting the power back to indigenous people for better child and family services. For GNN, and eventually more communities, it means that the children will grow up and stay close to their families with the services they need, surrounded by the love and care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559700"> If I had more time, I would have talked about the education work that we are doing. Nearly 25,000 students, in five provinces, are in culturally appropriate education programs right now, through 10 agreements that have been made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559701">I would have talked about the economic reconciliation path that we are on, the work that our <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> has done and the forum that was hosted in February. However, I am almost out of time, so I will conclude. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559702">Canadians should be proud of the progress made on the path to reconciliation, but we know there is still a lot more work to do. A flame has been ignited, but it is fragile and needs nurturing. Without care, it could be extinguished by reckless cuts and indifference. We cannot forget that Conservatives voted against funding for indigenous priorities during the marathon votes. They have told us exactly where they stand, and it is certainly not with indigenous people. Most Canadians have already left these colonial attitudes in the past. Today, our government is focused on building a system where everyone has a fair chance to succeed. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559704">Let me first mention a few contradictions. The government calls itself the champion of the free choice of pregnant women when it comes to making decisions about their own bodies, specifically under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, on the security of the person, and paragraph 2(a) of the Charter, on women's freedom of conscience and freedom of choice when it comes to a decision as personal as whether to terminate a pregnancy or not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559710">Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the Conservatives have treated indigenous people in this country with such immense malice, whether it was from the water legislation that ultimately was defeated in court because it failed to deliver clean water or whether it was child and family services that Conservatives continued to pump money into while families continued to get broken. There is no question that in their time, the Conservatives were brutal to indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559711"> However, the Liberal member mentioned that the Liberals have served indigenous people to the maximum extent to which they possibly could. I want to correct the record on that because time and time again, several promises that the Liberal government made have been broken, whether it is on trying to reform child and family services by way of Bill <Document DbId="10344307" Type="3">C-92</Document>, which many nations, still today, cannot access because of the lack of funding; whether it is on the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls inquiry, where it would take generations to actually implement all the calls to action at the pace the government is going; whether it is the failure to ensure that clean water in indigenous communities is actually delivered by way of a comprehensive clean water strategy; or lastly, whether it is on housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559712">As the New Democratic Party's critic for indigenous housing, I can say that less than 1% of all allocated funding for indigenous housing has gone out the door. That is shameful in a housing crisis. In my community of Edmonton Griesbach, for example, there are 4,011 people who are unhoused or without stable housing as of July. This is a crisis manifesting in indigenous communities that is then being transitioned to poverty in our streets.</ParaText>

People are not just down on their luck; there were always tent encampments, but there are middle-class Canadians who now cannot afford a place to live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559723">This is not the country I grew up in. This is not the country my parents chose to make home. There was a deal in this country, and when my parents came to this country, when they chose to make Canada home, my father was an uncredentialled engineer. He ended up driving a taxi to put his wife through school and to make sure he could buy a home in a safe neighbourhood for his family. That is exactly what he did. He sent two kids to school and made sure that in one generation, we could go from the front seat of a taxi to the front row of Parliament Hill. That is the dream of this country. Today, people cannot do that.</ParaText>

Food bank usage has risen every year for the last nine years, and that is every year that this government has been in power. Every year, they have added to the misery facing Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559756"> We used to look at parts of Vancouver and see the tent cities that had risen up there, and we used to see that as something that was unique to that area, but now, whether I am in Saint John, New Brunswick; Moncton; Fredericton; Halifax; or anywhere from coast to coast, we are seeing tent cities. We are seeing an increase in the misery that Canadians are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559757">Canadians have been forced to pay more for gas, groceries and home heating thanks to this completely out-of-touch Liberal carbon tax. At a time when people are struggling and having to make choices between heating their home, putting food on the table or filling their cars so they can get to work, and heaven forbid if their kids are playing hockey or are into other sports and they have to transport them in their vehicle, Canadians are stretched to the limit. What does this government do? What does this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do? They say that, no, Canadians are not paying enough. Even though the carbon tax is hitting people at 20¢ a litre, that has to go up. That has to go up eventually to 61¢ per litre. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559758">In April alone, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> increased the carbon tax by 23% as part of his plan to quadruple the tax to 61¢ per litre by 2030. According to the Fraser Institute, this will end up costing the average Canadian worker $6,700 per year and result in 164,000 fewer jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559759">As for the constituents I am talking to, their views on this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are being reflected across the country in the by-election results that we have seen. In three by-elections in a row, he has lost, but the conclusion the Prime Minister comes to is that it is not that he is wrong; it is that Canadians are wrong. That is always his default, because he believes that he knows best, he is always right and that everything that we are facing is somebody else's fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559760">After nine years, the blame for the situation that we are facing now as Canadians has to be laid squarely at the feet of this Liberal government and this Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is not some accident. The Prime Minister will often say that there are global trends and so on. The misery that we are seeing, for example the increase in crime, has to be directly blamed on the deliberate actions of this government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559761"> Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which was introduced and passed by the current government, created a revolving door so that the default is for an offender to get bail. Bail means that the person is back out on the street after committing a serious offence. We are hearing from experts, police officers and community leaders that the revolving door of repeat and, oftentimes, violent offenders is leading to tragic results. It is not that there are lots of Canadians involved in crime. It is that a small number of Canadians should be in jail, and they are committing a lot of crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559762">Let us look at what Statistics Canada says about just how out of control violent crime has become since 2015, the year the Liberals took power. I think members will agree that the numbers are absolutely staggering and are an indictment on the entire approach, the entire soft-on-crime, revolving-door, catch-and-release system that the Liberals have created. Madam Speaker, notice that I do not call it a “justice” system. It is only a system because there is no justice for victims in it. I was very moved at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights when we had a witness, who was a victim of crime, say that she does not call it a justice system, because she did not see the justice for her and her family in the system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559763">The crime statistics from Statistics Canada are as follows: Auto theft is up by 46%. Violent crime is up by 50%. Sexual assaults are up by 75%. Homicides are up by 28%. Human trafficking is up by 83%. Crimes against children are up by over 100%, at 118%. Gang-related murders have doubled. Extortion is up by 357%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559764">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talks a good game about gun crimes, but all we have seen now is $67 million spent on a gun confiscation scheme that has not collected one firearm. For all his talk about firearms crime, what is the result? Violent gun crime has gone up by 116%. In fact, gun crime has gone up every year since the Prime Minister took office. These are deliberate actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559765">Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, another terrible bill by the government, eliminated mandatory penalties related to gun crimes, such as robbery with a firearm, extortion with a firearm, weapons trafficking, possession of a firearm obtained illegally and using a firearm in the commission of an offence. What else did Bill C-5 do? It eliminated mandatory prison time for drug dealers, as well as for those who were convicted of trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking, importing and exporting serious drugs and production of a schedule I substance, such as heroin, cocaine, fentanyl or crystal meth. All of these offences are now eligible for house arrest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559766">The bill also allows for house arrest for sexual assault, kidnapping, human trafficking, motor vehicle theft, abduction of a person under 14, and assault causing bodily harm or with a weapon. Before the current government came along, all the offences I just listed would have meant incarceration; the offender would serve their time out of the community, in jail, where they belong. The community would be safe while the repeat offender was in jail. Instead, under the current government, these individuals are back on the street and committing the same crime over and over again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559767">I heard one Liberal member mention their so-called safe supply. Just today, the newspaper reported that a “police raid at a heavily used harm reduction site in Nanaimo resulted in” an individual being “charged with 14 counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking and eight weapons offences.” This was so-called legal safe supply. In the same raid, another person “was charged with six possession for the purpose of trafficking and five weapons offences”. As Conservatives have been saying, this so-called safe supply is getting into our streets and harming our young people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559768">It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to face reality. It is time to call a carbon tax election so that common-sense Conservatives can axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>

Many Canadians have been waiting years for this opportunity, and we are at a critical time in Canadian history.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559788">I was raised with stories about my ancestors, the prairie pioneers who came here well over 120 years ago with barely five dollars in their pockets. They worked extremely hard and were able to buy small plots of land. They worked their butts off. They lost many of their children along the way, whether it was from the flu or farming accidents, but they had the opportunity and dream that if they worked hard and made sacrifices, the next generation would be better off. That has been true for every single generation over the last 120 years that my family has been here, until now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559789">Every single generation has had the opportunity to be better off because of the hard work of their parents and grandparents.

              <ParaText id="8559791"> Do members know that food banks are seeing for the first time in Canadian history full-time working parents who cannot afford to feed their families? There are 35-year-olds, fully-educated, and working young people living in their parents basements because they cannot afford homes in the neighbourhoods they grew up in. This has never been the case in Canada, ever. However, this is what has happened after nine years of failed Liberal policies. Big government is here to help, but everything has been ruined by the Liberals.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559813">Madam Speaker, we have just finished debate in the House on a Conservative motion of non-confidence in the government. After nine years, so many Canadians are suffering as a result of the failures and frankly, in many cases the malicious failures, of the government that have undermined our national well-being and our social cohesion, as well as had a devastating impact on our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559814">I am looking forward to voting non-confidence in the government tomorrow. Tomorrow's vote will be a clear indication of where members stand. It will show which members of the House stand with the government and allow the government to continue, and which members of the House want to replace the government and give the Canadian people a chance to decide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559815">Our Conservative priorities are clear. We would like to bring Canadians a carbon tax election and present our proposals for axing the tax, building the homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559816">Now we are debating Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>, a Conservative private member's bill that seeks to advance our agenda of stopping the crime. It is a Conservative bill that would combat domestic violence by creating expanded measures for electronic monitoring. When I addressed the House about the bill last time, I noted that the bill would create a mechanism whereby a judge could mandate that a perpetrator would wear an electronic monitoring device, and also that victims would be consulted in the process of judges' making decisions about the kinds of orders that apply to perpetrators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559817">In giving judges additional tools for facilitating the monitoring of perpetrators, the bill is simply common sense and would provide additional protection and confidence for victims. It is a bill that would facilitate accountability for criminals and a greater degree of security for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559818">Sadly, the Liberal response to Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> follows a familiar pattern. When it comes to violence in general and domestic violence in particular, we hear plenty of words of solidarity from Liberal politicians. The Liberals are eager to verbally express that they care about people who are victims of domestic violence, yet when it comes to voting on measures that would actually make a concrete difference in making people safe, they back away. In fact they put forward amendments at committee and supported amendments at committee that have weakened the bill substantially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559819">Here at report stage, Conservatives are proposing to reverse the acts of vandalism to the good bill before us that happened at committee. We want to restore the bill such that it would live up to what was proposed and what was passed by the Senate to protect victims of crime. It is sad to see that, despite how members of all parties make statements opposing violence against women, when it comes to actually supporting measures that would meaningfully impact that reality, Conservatives are often standing alone. Certainly, we are trying to build coalitions in this place, without the support of the government, to advance the important legislation before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559820">I am very proud to speak in support of the bill, vote in support of the proposals from my colleagues that would reverse the damage done to the bill at committee, and allow Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> to pass and do the work that it is supposed to do to effectively stop crime, combat domestic violence in this country and give women a greater sense of security that those people who commit acts of violence against them would be held accountable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559821">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise in the House today to speak to my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>. It is a very important bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559822">When researching the bill, I found out that one woman is murdered every 48 hours in Canada. In fact, last year, 205 women were murdered in Canada, and we know that about 60% of murdered women in Canada were murdered by their intimate partner. This bill looks to address that. It looks to provide additional measures to protect women. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559823">I would just like to say off the bat that we know it is not exclusively women who are victims of intimate partner violence. Men can be as well. However, overwhelmingly, we know that it is women who are victimized and abused by their intimate partners, as well as their children. This bill aims to provide additional protections for them with more tools in the tool box to save their lives and the lives of their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559824">Unfortunately, through the democratic process, we saw some unfortunate moves from the NDP, the Bloc and, notably, the Liberals at the committee stage, where they gutted a lot of very important provisions in this bill to protect women. I am going to get into that in a moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559825">Before I do, and before I talk a bit more about the details of the bill, I do want to thank the original creator of this bill, Senator Boisvenu, who recently retired from the Senate. This bill originated in the Senate, and I was honoured to be asked to sponsor it in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559826">Senator Boisvenu has an extraordinary story in very tragic and victorious ways. His entire career has been dedicated to safeguarding women, fighting against domestic violence and providing more security tools for women who have been victims of intimate partner violence. It was inspired by his own daughter, who was kidnapped in a parking lot and murdered by a stranger. She would have been in her twenties at that time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559827">As a mother now, I cannot imagine what that would have been like for a parent. It is one of the more inspiring things I have heard of since being elected as a member of Parliament, that someone turned a horrific tragedy into the motivation to protect all women across Canada. He worked tirelessly throughout his Senate career to do that, and I thank him very sincerely for his courage and hard work on this. It is truly inspiring, as an elected official, to see that. It reminds us that we can really make a big difference in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559828">I also want to thank the incredible member for <Affiliation DbId="278557" Type="2">Peterborough—Kawartha</Affiliation>. In my absence in the last year after I had a baby, she shepherded the bill through committee and fought valiantly against what the Liberals and the other parties were looking to do to water it down. She did an incredible job. In fact, she has moved amendments in the House that we will vote on in the coming days. We are trying to convince everybody to put the bill back into its original form. It was stronger and provided more protections for women and victims. It was tougher on their abusers. We are looking to do that, so I thank her very much for her initiative to put forward those amendments to return it to its original stronger form. I thank her very much for her hard work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559829">What this bill has been left with is still very important. It is about peace bonds in particular. For those who do not know what a peace bond is, I will briefly tell them. They are sort of like restraining orders. A lot of people are familiar with that term. However, peace bonds are criminal court orders often related to the safety of property or of an individual, whereas restraining orders are non-criminal court orders often related to custody and family court issues. They are similar, but different. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559830">Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> would allow for a peace bond to be imposed if a victim demonstrates a reasonable fear of domestic violence. A number of conditions could be added to those peace bonds. This would allow a justice, the court process and prosecutors to ask for things such as therapy for the abuser as part of the peace bond. They could also ask that those with a peace bond cannot go to certain places or have to stay within a certain area. They may have to abstain from communication with the victim, or abstain from drug and alcohol consumption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559831">Most notably, it would provide the option within the peace bond to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. These really have come a long way in recent years. We are seeing in Quebec, which was one of the first to institute some of these, that it has had great success in the protection of women who have been victims of domestic violence. The abuser wears the bracelet. It has a GPS in it, which is connected to their former intimate partner's phone. If he or she, but notably he, comes within a certain distance of the person they had victimized, an alert centre would be notified and would immediately call that abuser to tell them that it is time to back off because they are getting a little close. If the abuser does not co-operate, or if there is a reason to believe that it is too tense of a situation and that it needs to send the police right away, it would do so.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559832"> It provides an alert system so that people can be informed of what is going on. Women can be alerted if they are in fear of their lives or if an individual is coming close. It involves a route for police to be sent directly to where an individual is and provides a barrier of protection. It is another tool in the tool box.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559833">This bill has been isolated to peace bonds, which is very good. I am excited to see it pass, as it will save lives. However, in its original form from the Senate, it was much more broad. Justices would have had the option to apply electronic monitoring bracelets to anyone who was getting bail, which was key. It would have been a monumental milestone to have that in the Criminal Code, particularly for those who have been victims of domestic violence and intimate partner violence. Notably, intimidation, breaking and entering, and being unlawfully in a dwelling or house, those kinds of things, could have triggered a justice to make someone on bail wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. It would have given them another checklist option, whereas now it is not front and centre for justices in those scenarios.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559834">We know about this from Senator Boisvenu and the research he has done. In particular for intimidation, breaking and entering, and being unlawfully in a house, when physical contact of an assault has not occurred but a relationship has become a tense situation, a woman could decide to seek legal help to get a peace bond or make a request through the court process for an electric monitoring bracelet. That opportunity could tip off justices that there are precursors to domestic violence, and they could institute a monitor on an individual. That was the key part missed at committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559835">We recently passed something called Keira's law, which we all supported. It was a very important law. For those who are not familiar with what happened to Keira, it is a devastating story, and it is wonderful that this place came together and passed something important. It was a good bill. Some argued that the bills were similar and did the same thing, but that is not entirely accurate. In fact, Keira's law was much more narrow. Although it was still very good, the original bill was going to have much broader impacts that considered all of the different violations of our law that occur in the scope of domestic violence, leading up to it in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559836">It is quite disappointing that something that would have provided a broader scope was so limited at the committee stage. This was the status of women committee, so it was surprising and bizarre to see it being gutted piece by piece by members of the committee. I read through all the testimony, and I am still scratching my head over why they would weaken protections for victims of intimate partner violence and their children. Perhaps they will respond to clarify, because nothing has been clear in everything that I have seen communicated from them. It has been very disappointing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559837">They gutted another provision as well. This one was really wild. There was a provision in the bill, right at the beginning, of paramount importance saying that victims would have to be consulted on their safety and security needs. During the process, a justice would have had to consult the prosecutor to see whether the victim had anything else they should know about so they could implement related protections for her. That was completely tossed out. Having a victims' rights option in there to have her voice heard on what she needs would have been required. We know there are a lot of problems in our judicial system about victims not being consulted, but that was gutted as well. It is interesting, because with Keira's law, the victim's stepfather supported that provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559838">Lastly, just to conclude, the original bill also made a peace bond last two to three years. It takes a lot of effort and courage to get peace bonds, and 12 months, especially for mothers, goes by quickly so they have to keep going back. We could have had a two- or three-year option for women. Now they would have to go back every 12 months. That was gutted by the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559839">It is deeply disappointing to see them prioritizing the abuser over the victim. We worked so hard to get this bill here. I would urge them to please consider our amendments. There are women's lives at stake. Let us do this together. Let us pass the strongest bill possible. Let us do it for women.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559840">Madam Speaker, this is another issue that should not be hijacked by partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559841">I rise today to speak to a bill that is important for women who are victims of domestic violence. The Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S‑205</Document>. This is bill is consistent with the initiatives that have strengthened the justice and policing systems to address domestic violence. Gender-based violence is a scourge, and we believe that this bill is a step in the right direction for achieving this goal. To follow on the work we did in committee, we are maintaining our support for Bill S‑205. The Bloc Québécois' position is consistent with the initiatives that seek to strengthen the mechanisms to better align the justice system with public safety, particularly to ensure better protection for victims of domestic violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559842">I will give an overview of this bill and then talk a bit about parole and the reservations we have. I will close by talking about the progress made in Quebec on this matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559843">First, I too would like to acknowledge Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu, who appeared before the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559844">Essentially, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Criminal Code to require a judge who is making a decision on the interim release of an accused person to ensure that the prosecutor has consulted the informant about their security needs. The bill would allow the judge to order the wearing of a monitoring device, commonly known as an electronic monitoring bracelet, when the prosecutor so requests. The purpose of the bill is to make it easier for the victim to obtain a copy of the order against the accused, and it requires the judge to ask the prosecutor whether the victim has been informed of the order. The bill also seeks to allow victims to lay an information before a judge about their abuser, if they have reasonable grounds to fear for their physical safety or that of their child. If the fear is justified, the judge may order the defendant to enter into a recognizance under threat of imprisonment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559845">The bill also gives the judge the authority to set the conditions for a good behaviour recognizance by imposing such things as psychosocial follow-up, relocation to a geographic area other than that of the informant, the obligation to refrain from going to a specified place and the obligation to refrain from communicating directly or indirectly with a child, the informant, the informant's child or any relative or close friend of the informant. The bill also allows the judge to prohibit the abuser from using social media and consuming drugs, alcohol or other intoxicants and to require that they provide a sample to check compliance with this condition. The bill also permits the informant to provide submissions in writing to the judge regarding the conditions of the recognizance to be set by the judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559846">Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> has three main components: the obligation to consult the victim before making a conditional release order; the addition of the concept of domestic violence, allowing a victim to apply to have the accused enter into a recognizance to keep the peace under the infamous section 810 of the Criminal Code; and the preponderance of the victim's version of events, which could influence the choice of conditions the defendant will be subject to under the recognizance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559847">Bill S‑205 broadens the scope of section 810 of the Criminal Code, which empowers the court to order the defendant to enter into a recognizance to be of good behaviour if the victim fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to them, their child or their intimate partner or damage to their property. The bill adds relatives, close friends and other people who may be targeted to that list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559848">Let us not forget that release, with or without conditions, allows an accused person to be released into the community while awaiting trial. In Quebec and Canada, criminal law and penal law must punish crime and protect the public. With femicide and domestic violence on the rise, it is important to strengthen mechanisms for protecting victims, their children and their loved ones. Modernizing the Criminal Code is an essential part of that, and that is exactly what Bill S‑205 does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559849">The Criminal Code sets out the conditions under which it would be justified to detain an accused person pending trial. The decision to detain a person awaiting trial depends on a number of factors specific to each situation. When it is in the public interest to detain an accused person, it is important to remember that the accused is deprived of the exercise of fundamental rights. These include the presumption of innocence and the right to life, liberty and security of the person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559850">Allowing the victim to be more involved in the legal process is a welcome improvement that the Bloc Québécois can support unreservedly. Victims should not have to fight for justice to be served. The bill will help reduce the obstacles that victims might encounter and that might dissuade them from taking the brave step of filing a complaint against their abuser. There might be gaps in the bill that could compromise certain fundamental rights, like the requirement to provide biological samples to prove that the defendant has not breached a recognizance to be of good behaviour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559851">We supported the amendment made in committee to clause 1, which deals with the criminal history of a violent intimate partner. The amendment excludes cases of limitation and focuses only on whether the person has already been convicted, regardless of which crime they have been charged with. This has the effect of covering a broader range of offences for the benefit of the victim. The same goes for the list of amendments in clause 2, which clarifies the legal definition of partners and their children, who are included in the risk assessment and the protections granted. For most of these amendments, it is a matter of aligning the amendment with the relevant section of the Criminal Code, as it currently stands. We heard that in committee from experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559852">We are in favour of the amendments dealing with specialized services for first nations, although all citizens should be entitled to the best support services available. However, we are not in favour of reducing the maximum time the judge can order the defendant to be of good behaviour from 2 years to 12 months. I still do not understand why this amendment was made at committee. In recent news, we have seen that spouses can act years later, motivated by revenge. Finally, we are in favour of the new clause 10.1 proposed by the committee. It includes the new amendments to the Criminal Code regarding firearms and all other types of weapons. This new section allows the judge to determine whether to prohibit the defendant from possessing any firearm, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, crossbow and prohibited device, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559853">In spite of our reservations regarding the bill as a whole, the Bloc Québécois will support it because it is commendable and seeks to make our communities safer, which is a net benefit for all Quebeckers. A sense of security within communities reinforces a nation's well-being. If passed, these legislative changes will represent an added value for victims, including female victims of domestic or sexual violence. The justice system has to be more effective in general and more transparent, not least to facilitate the legal process and ease the long-term effects on victims or their family, especially when a decision is made about releasing the assailant. It also strengthens public trust in the justice system so that no other victim of a crime will hesitate to report it to the police. This is still a problem in 2024—victims are still reluctant to come forward and report their abusers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559854">Quebec is one of the most progressive nations when it comes to protecting victims of family and domestic violence. In fact, Quebec's department of public safety launched a Quebec-wide electronic monitoring device pilot project. In December 2022, more than 650 offenders on parole were fitted with such a device. Let us not forget that these are people being prosecuted for offences for which they could be sentenced to incarceration in a Quebec prison. Federal offenders were not subject to the same conditions. It is time to settle this discrepancy and make sure that all inmates released from prison are subject to the same restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559855">Statistics show that femicide and domestic violence are on the rise. Between 2009 and 2019, there was an increase of 7.5%. The updated statistics are chilling, particularly the ones released by Statistics Canada this summer. In Quebec alone, 14 femicides occurred in 2024, and eight of those women were killed by their partner or former partner. The first femicide took place in the riding of Shefford. I would like to once again offer my condolences to the victim's loved ones, whom I had the opportunity to meet during a difficult time this summer. They decided to turn their tragic experience into something positive by organizing an event to help raise funds for Maison Alice-Desmarais, a shelter for women fleeing domestic violence. The shelter is located in Granby.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559856">As I was saying, the situation is now catastrophic. It is imperative that we use this solution, which may not be perfect but is still the best solution. As we know, electronic bracelets with geolocation save lives. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to help reverse this disturbing trend. The reality on the ground highlights the shortcomings of the status quo that prevails in the justice system. Many victims continue to fear their abuser, even when that individual is in custody. We can only applaud an initiative that seeks to improve the victim's experience of the justice system throughout the process, starting from the moment she decides to file a complaint. I would like to point out that Quebec elected officials produced a non-partisan report entitled “Rebâtir la confiance”, or rebuilding trust. Politics were set aside to tackle this problem. I say bravo for the specialized courts and the electronic monitoring bracelets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559857">In closing, the Bloc Québécois will stand up for women who are victims of domestic violence. Even one victim is one too many. Several communities have declared femicide an epidemic. We need to take action. I want to say one last thing. Last Friday, I marched with the Coalition des groupes de femmes de la Haute-Yamaska et de Brome-Missisquoi and many other groups from across Quebec. I was deeply moved to be joining those women once again this year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559858"> Madam Speaker, I am rising to join tonight's debate on Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>, a Senate public bill that is now before the House after a very long journey. It has gone through the Senate, and it is now before us for report stage and third reading. I believe we will come to the consequential votes of this particular bill tomorrow. Recently, of course, it has gone through six meetings at the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women. It finds itself here via former senator Pierre‑Hugues Boisvenu and is now being sponsored here in the House by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278424" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559859"> I also want to recognize another member, my NDP colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="278288" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>, who is a member of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. Not only in her own riding but indeed right across this country, she has been a stalwart champion for women and for raising these particular issues. I know that our entire caucus is extremely proud of the work she does on this issue every day. We are certainly very grateful for the work she did as our caucus member of that standing committee so the House could consider the committee's work on the bill that is before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559860"> Intimate partner violence is absolutely a national crisis, and we know that the statistics outline that in very stark ways. We know that about every six days, a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. That statistic is very troubling to me personally, being a father of three daughters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559861">We know that globally, before COVID, one in three women experienced some form of intimate partner violence. We know that the rates are highest in households that are low-income and indigenous. There has been a surge in recent years in gender-based violence, including intimate partner violence. We know that the number of cases for women and girls in Canada involving a male accused increased by 27% in 2022 compared to before the pandemic in 2019. We know that in recognition of the massive surge of violence, the aforementioned Standing Committee on the Status of Women just recently undertook a study into this very important and concerning issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559862"> We know that the situation is dire. In several Canadian cities, places like Ottawa, where the House of Commons is located; Toronto; and Kitchener, this is recognized as an epidemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559863"> There is a role, of course, for us as federal legislators and for the federal government. We have jurisdiction over how the Criminal Code is structured, and indeed the bill before us has some important amendments to it. We cannot alone legislate ourselves out of the problem. It is worth repeating here, as many of my colleagues have consistently done, that the current Liberal government has implemented only two of the 231 calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559864"> In my riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, there is a relatively high indigenous population. From speaking with many female indigenous members of my community, I know that this is a particularly galling statistic and one that they take great issue with. They feel that they are not being seen and that their personal circumstances are not rating high enough for the government's attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559865"> I also want to take some time to recognize the organizations that are working on the ground in Cowichan—Malahat—Langford. There is the Cowichan Women Against Violence Society, which works from a feminist perspective to provide a supportive environment primarily to women and children who have been impacted by violence. It is there to support diversity, change, choice and growth through counselling, advocacy, emergency shelter services, community development and education. There is also the Victoria Women's Transition House, which has been supporting and advocating for women since 1974. That organization is active in the southern part of my riding, in the great city of Langford.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559866">When we turn to Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>, there are a number of elements. I do want to recognize that the bill is not in the same form as when the Senate handed it over to the House of Commons. I know that following those six meetings at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, a number of amendments were made to the bill, and I know we have some report stage amendments before us. We will, as a House, be deciding on the final form that we eventually want to have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559867">Some notable elements in the bill include mentions of the use of electronic monitoring devices, and I think some of the biggest parts of the bill deal with the recognizance orders that could be put in place for survivors of intimate partner violence, which would allow judges to impose conditions on these or for a domestic counselling program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559868">If we were to delve into the bill and look at those recognizance orders, first of all, there are a lot of different examples in the bill. It should be noted that the overall purpose would be to prevent serious harm by imposing conditions on a person, which can ultimately restrict their behaviour or their movement and essentially be a barrier the court could impose to reduce the risk of them committing a future offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559869">We have to go back to section 810 of the Criminal Code to find existing provisions, and this bill would add some amendments to those particular sections. For example, there could be an order to attend a treatment program, to remain within a specified geographic area, to wear an electronic monitoring device so the person's whereabouts are known at all times, to abstain from communicating, to refrain from using social media or to abstain from the consumption of drugs and alcohol. Again, these all could vary based on the facts of the case before the court. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559870">I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278288" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> for her hard work. We, as a caucus, will continue to support this bill. We believe that through the provisions in this bill, the legislative changes would be of benefit to survivors of intimate partner violence. It would provide some of the legislative guardrails that are necessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559871">However, we are not going to legislate ourselves out of this problem. This is one piece of the puzzle that we as legislators can have a positive impact on, but we have a responsibility as a society to act swiftly and decisively to prevent and eliminate intimate partner violence and to support survivors. Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>, on balance, would be a step in the right direction, but I think many people who are listening to this debate and who have that lived experience would agree with me that the work is far from over. We certainly must keep this issue top of mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559872">With that, I will conclude my remarks. I appreciate being able to speak to this particular issue on behalf of my constituents.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278617" Type="2">Mr. Brendan Hanley (Yukon, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559873"> Madam Speaker, I am also here to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code and to make consequential amendments to another act regarding interim release and domestic violence recognizance orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559874">Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> proposes amendments to the bail and peace bond provisions of the Criminal Code and the Youth Criminal Justice Act to address intimate partner violence, a cause that all of us in the House should be seized with. I will start by thanking the Standing Committee on the Status of Women for their work on the bill. The committee looked carefully at Bill S-205 and identified ways to strengthen it while maintaining the original spirit of the legislation. I also want to recognize the contributions and expertise of the witnesses, all of whom shared their diverse perspectives, which were often of a deeply personal nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559875">Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> has two main components, bail and peace bonds, and I will touch on each of these in turn, starting with bail. Bill S-205, as passed by the Senate, proposed four changes to the Criminal Code related to bail. First, the bill would have required a justice, before making a bail order for an offence involving intimate partner violence, to ask the prosecutor whether the intimate partner of the accused had been consulted about their safety and security needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559876">The committee voted in favour of removing this proposal because it would have been duplicative of existing bail provisions. Moreover, it could have had the unintended consequence of endangering victims. Under this proposal, victims could have had details about their safety needs revealed to an audience, potentially including the accused, in court. This goes against protecting their security. Victim support services are better positioned to discuss safety and security needs with the victim in a more private setting, without the accused present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559877">Second, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> would have required bail courts to consider imposing a condition that the accused wear an electronic monitoring device, for any offence charged, at the request of the Crown. This provision was removed from the bill because, under section 515 of the Criminal Code, it is already possible to impose electronic monitoring. Explicitly adding it as an optional condition could result in it being routinely imposed, even where it is not warranted. Most importantly, this provision was removed because it runs counter to the approach of Bill <Document DbId="11536206" Type="4">C-233</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Judges Act regarding violence against an intimate partner, which received royal assent on April 27, 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559878">Bill <Document DbId="11536206" Type="4">C-233</Document> ensures that electronic monitoring is specifically considered as a bail condition in cases of intimate partner violence. This tailored approach is crucial. It signals to judges that intimate partner violence is a crime for which electronic monitoring may be especially successful in protecting victims. If we had extended this condition to all offences, intimate partner violence would no longer be singled out for special consideration from judges. Our government supports the tailored approach of Bill C-233 to best protect women and other victims of intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559879">Third, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> proposed amending the reverse onus bail provisions in section 515 of the Criminal Code. A reverse onus is where the accused must demonstrate that they should be released instead of the burden of proof being on the prosecutor to demonstrate that they should be detained. The proposed change would expand the existing intimate partner violence reverse onus for bail to apply not only to accused individuals who were previously convicted but also to those who were previously discharged on an intimate partner violence offence. This amendment remains in the bill and is identical to a change our government made in Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which passed last year after receiving unanimous support in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559880">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> would require the justice to ask the prosecutor if the victim has been informed of their right to have a copy of the bail order after a decision on bail has been made. I support this measure to improve transparency in the justice system and enhance victims' access to information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559881">Moving on to the peace bond regime, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> would create a new peace bond focused on preventing domestic violence, which is understood as violence directed at an intimate partner or child of either partner. Peace bonds are entirely separate from criminal punishment or sentencing. They can be sought when there is a reasonable fear that a crime may occur, and they are designed to prevent crimes from taking place. The committee adopted several amendments to the peace bond proposed in Bill S-205, to strengthen the original intent of the bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8559882">For example, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S‑205</Document> proposed that the defendant's intimate partner be allowed to apply for a recognizance to keep the peace. This approach differs from existing recognizance to keep the peace provisions in the Criminal Code, which allow a person other than a person who may be a victim of the alleged offence, such as a police officer or a family member, to apply for the recognizance on their behalf.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8559883"> The committee's amendments would ensure that the new domestic violence peace bond could be brought forward by someone on behalf of a person who fears that a crime will occur, as is the current practice for other peace bond regimes. I am somewhat surprised to see amendments from my Conservative colleagues to restrict this back to only the victims. This seems counterintuitive to a victim-centric approach.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8559884">The committee also made several amendments to ensure that the duration, conditions and procedures of the new recognizance to keep the peace provision are consistent with similar existing recognizance provisions in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559885">For example, in the new provision, the maximum duration of the recognizance to keep the peace would be 12 months, or two years if there is a prior conviction, which is consistent with recognizance to keep the peace provisions that apply to organized crime, forced marriages, serious personal injury offences and sexual offences against a minor. Similarly, the maximum term of imprisonment for failure to sign a recognizance to keep the peace would be 12 months in order to align with all other recognizance to keep the peace provisions in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8559886">Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document> also proposes conditions that could be imposed on a defendant in a peace bond. The committee made several changes to the list of conditions proposed, which included removing the condition requiring the defendant to refrain from using social media. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559887">It is important to point out that peace bond conditions are not intended to be punitive, but preventative, and they are to be tailored to a specific threat. The use of social media could be interpreted broadly by the courts to include things such as job searches or shopping for second-hand furniture. While some uses of social media may be linked to a specific threat posed by the defendant, in many cases it may not be, yet breaching the condition would still be considered a criminal offence. Moreover, defendants in a peace bond would already be prohibited from contacting in any way or stalking the person who sought the peace bond, so the social media prohibition is not necessary for protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559888">Next, I will speak to the peace bond condition that would require the defendant to refrain from going to specified places, such as the home or work of the intimate partner. This is essential to ensure the safety and security of the victim and is often the main reason for seeking a peace bond order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559889">The committee voted to expand this condition to further prohibit the defendant from going within a specified distance of a place to allow for the imposition of a radius within which the accused would be prohibited from going. For example, the condition could provide that the defendant must not go within 500 meters of the victim's home to prevent stalking behaviour, such as sitting in a car outside the victim's residence. I would support this amendment, which would strengthen the existing protections for victims of intimate partner violence. My colleagues across the way also appear to want to repeal this amendment, which I am of the firm belief gives stronger protection to victims.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8559890">The last amendment I want to talk about was proposed as a result of an NDP motion to allow an alternative to the peace bond process when the informant or the defendant is indigenous. Under this change, the judge must determine whether it would be appropriate, instead of ordering a recognizance to keep the peace, to recommend that indigenous support services be provided if available. The purpose of this amendment is to address the overrepresentation of indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system by allowing the use of alternative justice methods for healing. I support this change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559891">To conclude, Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S‑205</Document> makes targeted but important changes to criminal law to better address domestic violence.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8559892">I urge all members to support the bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559894">Madam Speaker, many women helped create Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S‑205</Document> by joining forces and working hard. I want to pay tribute to these women and their resilience. Their insights and hard work have led to the tabling of this legislation before us which seeks to strengthen the Criminal Code and to put in place preventive safety measures called interim release at the beginning of the legal process, when a woman decides to report the violence she has experienced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559895">I rise in the House to speak to a bill that proposes a solution to the issues that affect thousands of victims of domestic violence by providing them with the protection and supports they desperately need to regain their safety and dignity. Bill S‑205 invites us to reflect on the fate of victims who have come to testify about how their domestic violence complaints were dealt with at the reporting stage by the police, as well as the entire process dedicated to such complaints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559896">I would especially like to talk about victims of sexual assault in sports, because over the past two years, as I reviewed the accounts of several athletes who were victims of violence and abuse, I realized to my great dismay how the system does not do justice to the victims. In routine court proceedings, lawyers agree on a number of things, such as a publication ban on the identity of the victim, a witness or a stakeholder in the justice system, even before the trial begins. What about the victim's right to lift the ban? One of the first things I noticed was how little opportunity there is in the system to consult with victims who are subject to a publication ban. That issue was pointed out by the people at My Voice, My Choice, whom I salute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559897">I rose several times in the House with the hope that the Prime Minister would open an independent, public inquiry into the sports and that this would highlight the absurdity of the mechanisms chosen to address violence and sexual assault, as well as the need to better protect our athletes and children. Why are athletes in vulnerable or power imbalance situations treated differently, outside the courts? That is a debate we should take the time to get into in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559898">When Rick Westhead's article came out, were it not for my intervention in the House and for the motion on Hockey Canada being adopted unanimously, what would have happened in the now high profile case of the alleged victim of gang rape by Hockey Canada players? Sport Canada was informed in June 2018, but did nothing. The chief of the London police apologized for not getting to the bottom of things at the time, and I could list everything the victim went through. The system allowed for the imposition of a non-disclosure agreement—or her silence in exchange for monetary compensation. Two years of work at the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage and public pressure help put this case back on track, where it should have been from the start. The victim, in this case, could apply to have the publication ban lifted at any time during the trial, when she feels safe enough to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559899">I see the similarities with Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S‑205</Document>. We must give victims back the power to decide whether or not to be informed. We should not be making decisions for them. We must give them tools to ensure they have some sense of safety, such as requiring the alleged abuser to wear an electronic device if they are released on bail. We must take the time to do the right thing and implement preventive safety measures. What do we know about “peace bonds”, often referred to as “810s” in legal jargon? We know the system uses them too often, and perhaps too quickly. Here again, we are confronted with that reality in each and every case that is reported in the newspapers. Orders issued under section 810 of the Criminal Code and the amount of red tape involved in filing complaints too often result in victims withdrawing their complaint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559900">I want to talk about indigenous women because, in rereading the testimony heard in the Senate, and given my role in connection to indigenous relations, I paid close attention to testimony from the Native Women's Association of Canada, represented by Sarah Niman, the organization's legal counsel. I would like to echo those voices. I am addressing my colleagues with a deep concern for indigenous women who, when they experience violence, are often abandoned by a system that is supposed to protect them. Too often, when an indigenous woman finds the courage to ask for help, she is confronted with a system that turns its back on her.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8559901">Instead of protecting her, the Criminal Code allows the abuser to remain free and keep hurting her while we wait for a solution to be found. The wait can seem endless at times, however. It is unacceptable that the safety of an indigenous woman should depend on her ability to persuade others of her worth and her right to protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559902">That is why we must support Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S‑205</Document>. This bill is far more than a piece of legislation. It is the promise of justice. It seeks to redefine our approach to violence against indigenous women by putting their safety and security at the heart of the legal process. Bill S‑205 not only creates specific intervention for indigenous women, it establishes a framework that will allow them to be seen, heard and respected in a system that too often ignores them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559903">This bill puts the criminal justice system under an obligation to consider the safety of victims at every stage, from the initial request for assistance until the end of the proceedings. The time has come to give victims a voice and restore their power to choose a path to justice. By supporting this bill, we are taking a decisive step toward a more just society where every woman, no matter her background, deserves to be safe and protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559904">We are in favour of the amendments on specialized services for first nations, even though all citizens should be entitled to the best support services available. The Bloc Québécois is in favour of most of the measures set out in Bill S‑205. Allowing victims to be more involved in the legal process that concerns them is a good step forward that the Bloc Québécois can fully support. Victims should not have to go to great lengths to seek justice. The bill helps to reduce the obstacles that victims may face and that may dissuade them from courageously pursuing their complaint against their abuser. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559905">We support the amendment made in committee to clause 1, pertaining to the criminal record of a violent intimate partner. The same goes for the list of amendments to clause 2 to clarify the legal definition of partners and the children of partners and include them in the risk assessment and the protections that are granted. We are opposed to reducing the maximum period of good behaviour from two years to 12 months. Finally, the committee improved the bill with a provision that enables judges to decide whether to prohibit the accused from possessing prohibited and restricted firearms, prohibited devices and crossbows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559906">Quebec is recognized as one of the most progressive nations when it comes to protecting victims of family violence. It has rolled out some promising initiatives, including electronic monitoring devices that help keep victims safer by restricting the movements of abusers. As of December 2022, more than 850 offenders had already been fitted with these devices. However, we know that challenges remain. The same protections do not apply to persons convicted at the federal level. It is imperative to standardize the conditions of release for all abusers so that all victims are kept safe, free from discrimination or distinction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559907">The legislative changes we are proposing will genuinely benefit victims, especially women affected by domestic or sexual violence. We need to make our justice system more efficient and more transparent. This requires clear and timely decisions regarding the release of abusers. However, it also demands greater awareness, so that all victims can report crimes without fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559908">The numbers are chilling. The Quebec government's report on rebuilding trust noted an alarming 7.5% increase in femicide and domestic violence between 2009 and 2019. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to reverse this worrying trend. The reality on the ground demonstrates that many victims continue to live in fear of their abuser, even when he or she is in custody. This is unacceptable. It is essential to create an environment in which victims feel supported, listened to and protected. That is our duty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559916">Madam Speaker, at a time when our country is facing historic challenges, Canadians are facing the doubling costs of everything. Food price inflation is at record highs. The cost of rent has doubled. The cost of mortgages has doubled. Even the needed down payment has doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559917">Today, common-sense Conservatives put forward a motion calling for a carbon tax election, declaring that we have lost confidence in the government. That loss of confidence is born out of what we have heard from Canadians, who are struggling. They cannot afford to eat. They cannot afford to buy a home. They cannot afford to rent a home. They can nary afford a tent to live in. Tent encampments are increasing in size in communities across this country. There is desperation from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559918">It was not like this before. What has changed? One thing that has changed is that the government has decided to put its friends first and help its friends line their pockets while Canadians are lined up at food banks. There are incredible examples, like the $21 billion that the NDP-Liberal government spent on outside consultants last year, on their buddies at McKinsey and their buddies at GC Strategies with the $60-million arrive scam scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559919"> The Liberals are lining the pockets of their friends with wanton disregard for the effects that their inflationary spending is having on Canadians. They like to talk about all of the help they are going to give to Canadians sometime in the future. However, Canadians would not need the scale of rescue that the government proposes if it were not for the injury being caused by that same NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559920">Inflationary spending, corruption and grift are what we have seen after nine years of the NDP-Liberals, and it is Canadians who are paying the price, not just through the cost of servicing the debt that has been racked up, but also with the lack of available funds to take care of what matters most to Canadians. That says nothing of the fact that the Liberals' carbon tax on everything does nothing to help our environment, but drives up the price of absolutely everything. They want to see it raised to over 60¢ a litre. It is a tax on the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who moves it, the grocer who sells it, the food processors and of course the Canadians who buy it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559921">It is economic vandalism after nine years of these NDP-Liberals, and Canadians need relief. Why will the government not just give Canadians a carbon tax election so they can decide?</ParaText>

The government is taking steps to ensure that all departments are better positioned to undertake projects of this nature in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559925"> Regarding ongoing investigations into alleged misconduct, the RCMP is assessing all available information, including the Auditor General's performance audit report, and will take appropriate action. To protect the integrity of the investigation, the RCMP will not be providing any further information at this time. We know that a pillar of our democracy is to have independent police services and there should be no interference in the RCMP's investigation. I can also confirm that the president of the CBSA similarly referred allegations of misconduct received in 2022 to its professional integrity division, which has been actively working on its administrative investigation since then, and which has also referred the allegations to the RCMP.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559933">Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to a question I raised in the House back in the spring session, shortly after the budget was delivered, when the government issued more debt and extended the debt it was going to visit upon Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559934">I asked that because the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions talked about follow-on risks of the added debt the government was bringing into the financial equation for Canadians. Those follow-on risks include things such as stress in the mortgage insurance industry, investment portfolio risk, asset management risk and insurance risk. These are things the government does not have its eye on when it loads on more and more money. It keeps extending the balance sheet, not just to the government, but also its Crown corporations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559935">The Bank of Canada's balance sheet is expanding its liabilities, and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is expanding its balance sheet with more liabilities. This is more risk for Canadians. That risk is borne in higher costs throughout the financial system and Canadians eventually bear that. They bear that because the government manages Canadians' money and pulls the money in. It is no wonder the government is raising taxes because there are more bills to pay. The primary part of the bill, of course, is ever-rising interest on the debt that they are incurring. This is a house of cards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559936">At the time, I stated that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> needed to redo the budget because, frankly, it was not delivering for Canadians. The government is spending way beyond our means and loading a whole bunch of burden onto future Canadian taxpayers. At that point in time, the <Affiliation DbId="311618" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>'s response to me was that it is a hard time for Canadians, but then tried to blame rising mortgage costs on Conservatives, as if we have been in government causing all of this mayhem in the Canadian financial system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559937">I am going to go back to what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said years ago when he talked about the Canadian government taking on a whole bunch of debt so Canadians do not have to. The issue is that both have happened. The government's debt-to-GDP ratio is now 107%. It is referenced in the International Monetary Fund's own disclosure documents, which I referred to last week in a previous session. That amount is excessive, and we recognize how high that is. However, the <Affiliation DbId="311618" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> tried to tell me last week that it is only 40%. It was, frankly, misinformation. It is in the government's own documents and exists nowhere else in the world. Government debt in Canada is 107% of our GDP. Liberals can reference that, and Canadians can reference that any time they want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559938">If we add to that the Canadian debt that is held by the public, that is about 102% of GDP. If the government debt, all in, is $2.1 trillion, counting both provincial and federal debt, and the Canadian consumer debt is about $2.5 trillion, we are talking about a massive 209% minimum debt-to-GDP ratio in this country. There is no other country in the world, frankly, with such an offside both on the consumer side and on the government side. This whole thing about issuing debt for the benefit of Canadians, when the government is also incurring a whole bunch of debt, is only layering on. I will get back to the cost of this. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8559940">Madam Speaker, our government continues to manage Canada's public finances responsibly. I know the member opposite seems to disagree with that, but he should remember that our debt service costs are the lowest in the G7 when compared to GDP, as 0.6% of GDP is the cost to service the national debt. Also, contrary to what the member has said, the International Monetary Fund has rated Canada number one in the world in terms of budget balance and also gives Canada a number one ranking in the G7, expecting the largest GDP growth in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559941">In fact, Canada has done fairly well in the grand scheme of things. The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on the world economy. There were lots of losses of revenue and lots of interruptions to supply chains. It was one of the biggest economic dips one could see, probably at least in the last 100 years. We have recovered quite quickly from that, which is good news for Canadians. Our government is quite proud of our record of support to Canadians during that time, which has allowed us to recover quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559942">Some of that debt, obviously, Canada now services, but at a much lower rate and with a AAA credit rating, which we have maintained. We also know that Canada is leading the G7 in achieving a soft landing from the postpandemic surge in inflation and high interest rates. The Bank of Canada was the first central bank in the G7 to cut interest rates since the recent global hiking cycle, first to cut it twice and first to cut it a third time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559943">This is something I think all Canadians should recognize. Certainly the member opposite should admit that it is a very positive sign for Canada's recovery postpandemic that we are the first country to do three rate cuts with our central bank. The Bank of Canada has said that Canada's budget has stuck to its fiscal guardrails that were set out in last year's fall economic statement, and that was exactly why inflationary pressures were alleviated from the economy. It said the government managed its resources in such a way as to ensure that those interest rates could start to come down faster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559944">This is helping people who have a mortgage coming up for renewal. It is helping people with variable rate mortgages immediately. It is helping people looking to buy a first home. This is helping business owners from coast to coast to coast who may be carrying debt. Interest rates are falling because inflation has come down. It has come down for many months in a row, from over 8% to now 2%, which is right at the Bank of Canada's target rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559945">This is really good news for Canadians. Things are looking up. Canada's economy is recovering. I know that the member opposite and I can debate fiercely, but I think the facts speak for themselves. Even our Parliamentary Budget Officer recently came out with a report that showcased that Canada could spend over $40 billion more per year. That is not the intention of this government, of course, but it was interesting to hear the Parliamentary Budget Officer say there is actually fiscal room there. To hear these independent experts actually say that our government has—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559952">Canada has fared much better than many other peer countries around the world. We have had inflation come down to the Bank of Canada's target rate. We have stuck to our fiscal guardrails. The IMF has rated Canada number one in terms of budget balance and number one when it comes to GDP growth in 2025, which is next year. Canada is faring very well. We have the highest per capita foreign direct investment. We have recovered over two million jobs in the postpandemic recovery.

              <ParaText id="8559953">Madam Speaker, I stand before members with a heavy heart today to share some stories of moms and dads whom I heard from over the course of the summer. They shared with me the heartbreaking truth that they just cannot afford the quality food that they want to give their kids. These are proud parents who have done everything right. They work hard and play by the rules, yet they find they are struggling not to get ahead but just to get by. They told me of the feeling of looking into the eyes of their little ones and of the desperation in being unable to fulfill the most basic need by providing a healthy, decent meal for their kids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559954"> I also spoke with many seniors, the very individuals who built this country, who are now faced with an unbearable reality. I vividly recall one senior who had tears forming in her eyes as she told me how her rent and utility bill increases have made it near impossible to afford anything else. She cannot afford fresh fruit, fresh veggies or anything that she wants to enjoy her passion with, which is cooking. She can barely afford to feed herself, never mind feeding anyone else. She told me she thought she had a good pension, and she saved her whole life; however, she cannot stretch these dollars any further. She told me that this was not the Canada she remembered, and it was not the retirement she expected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559955">For these folks, their spirits are shattered when they have to line up at a food bank, empty-handed and exhausted, just to pick up a few extra meals to get through to the end of the month. They told me that they feel like a burden, or worse, a failure on behalf of their family. They do not want to have to ask their family and friends for help. I respect that pride, but they should not have to feel this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559956">Let us not forget the staggering truth that the number of Canadians relying on food banks has reached an all-time high. This is not the Canada that these Canadians, nor any of us, were promised. I grew up believing that, if we went to school, worked hard and played by the rules, no dream was too big and retirement with dignity would not be out of reach. However, many are left wondering how they are going to afford dinner instead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559957">The government has let Canadians down. It has pushed them to the brink, to a feeling of loneliness and failure. I would be shocked if Liberal and NDP colleagues did not hear the same story, or one very similar, over the course of the summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559958"> Now, I expect my colleague across the way will respond to this question with talking points about how great all the Liberals' care programs are. However, no government program could ever restore the lost pride of those parents or those retirees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559959"> According to Harvest Manitoba, food bank usage surged by 150% between 2019 and 2023. How many more families will have to suffer? How many will have to line up in desperation before the government recognizes its own failures? How many more families must line up at a food bank before the Liberals finally axe the tax and recognize that, if we tax the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who ships the food and the grocer who sells the food, we put a tax on all Canadians? How bad does it have to get until they realize their failed policies have caused this? How long until the Liberals and the NDP take a good, long look in the mirror and realize that their policies, while perhaps well intentioned, are the cause of this misery for so many Canadians? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559960"> Madam Speaker, I was a little shocked to hear the hon. member call some of our programs and the things we stand for and have been implementing, “all of [those] care programs”, as if they can be lumped into some nebulous, unintelligible phrase. It seems to me a shame that he does not understand the value of pharmacare, dental care, mental health care and the health care investments we have made. All of the care programs he has spoken of are designed to help lift people up, care for them and help with the affordability challenges that Canadians are facing. Maybe that is just an aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559961">I would like to get back to the heart of the member's question, which I think was focused, at least from what was tabled in the House, on the housing crisis. I can assure the member that the crisis is not unique to Manitoba and is not unique to any part of this country; it is actually all across the country. The housing crisis has been around since long before the current government was in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559962">In fact, the current government put forward the national housing strategy. One of the reasons I stepped up in 2019 and put my name on a ballot was that for the first time in 30 years, I saw a federal government willing to invest in housing in a meaningful way. It made a big, bold commitment to reducing homelessness, to helping solve the affordable housing challenges that Canadians were facing. The plan, with significant investments of over $70 billion over 10 years, was a really big reason for my wanting to get involved in politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559963">Certainly, the housing challenges have morphed and changed, and the market has shifted. I admit that there are significant challenges. I feel passionate about this issue. I feel compassion for every Canadian who either cannot afford to buy a home or who is struggling with affordability challenges and is at risk of homelessness. That is something the government takes very seriously. We have put effort, time and energy into developing a strategy and implementing real solutions, not slogans, like “axe the tax”, which are false signifiers that have no meaning and are going to help not one person with getting housed in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559964">We are waiving GST on new rental construction. We are helping non-profits purchase housing stock that would otherwise become unaffordable or be bought up. We are helping co-operatives develop more housing with $1.5 billion in support for them. We are working with municipalities through the housing accelerator fund to make it easier and faster to get shovels in the ground and to improve medium density and other forms of housing density that will lower the cost for Canadians. We have just made mortgage rule changes that will help more and more Canadians access a lower-cost mortgage. Individuals who rent will be able to have their responsible rental history count toward their acquiring a mortgage in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559965">These are all positive steps and real solutions that are helping people, not to mention the historic investment we have made in the national housing strategy that has helped over 500,000 Canadians right across this country to get housing, or to maintain or repair housing if it was in disarray.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559966">Madam Speaker, I think that the member's response is a great example of the false reality Liberal-NDP members live in, where everything is fine. I talked about suffering, and he offered compassion. Compassion is fine, but Liberals caused the problem and are trying to offer fake solutions to fix the problem they caused; this is why Canadians are so upset. They want to be left alone. They want to work hard. They want to play by the rules. They want to earn a good-quality living with powerful paycheques to pay for their family's food and living expenses and to help the next generation get ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559967">However, all of a sudden, the Liberals have the idea to quadruple the size of the carbon tax to make it 61¢ a litre. Do they think that is going to have no impact on the quality of life of Canadians now and in the future? It is remarkable to me that they can live in this false reality. How do they wake up in the morning and think everything is fine if they talk to anybody in their ridings and recognize it is not?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8559968"> Madam Speaker, it is interesting that the member talks about a false reality. From where I sit, it is the Conservatives that have a false reality. They are unhinged from reality. In fact, they offer zero solutions. They offer three-word slogans, and others such as “powerful paycheques”. What the heck does that mean? I have no clue what the Conservative Party means by that. It is a false promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559969">It is something that the Conservatives keep repeating over and over again. They think it sounds good. They think, somehow, it is going to light up people's brains in some fancy way or give people some emotional response and then they are going to vote for the Conservative Party. That makes no sense. It is not going to solve the affordable housing crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8559970">We put forward a plan with real solutions and are investing significant dollars because Canada has a great balance sheet. We are doing that to benefit Canadians, to help them get housed, to help solve homelessness and to help solve the affordable housing crisis.</ParaText>
