              <ParaText id="8718369">John from Langford, as he was affectionately known, was a great Canadian and fierce fighter for our province. He believed and lived the belief that we can build a strong economy and do the best for the most vulnerable, and that the two are inextricably linked. That is what we loved about John. Even as a federal Liberal I admired his pragmatism, his passion and his ability to cross traditional boundaries of politics to build a coalition of British Columbians that dared to build a better future. Our province is better off having had John Horgan as our premier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718370">To his wife, Ellie, and his children, I send on behalf of all of us in the House our sincere condolences. I thank them for sharing John with us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718373">Many have already lost their jobs, and now another 1,400 forestry workers in Lac‑Saint‑Jean and on the north shore are directly threatened because of a federal decree that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> wants to impose. What is the member for<Affiliation DbId="278335" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation> doing about this? Nothing. He has not asked a single question in the House to defend workers, nor has he taken any concrete action. All he has done is take part in round table discussions that lead nowhere. Worse still, he voted twice to keep this government in place, clearing the way for it to impose this destructive decree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718374">It is clear that the Bloc Québécois and the Liberals are forming a coalition against the regions and against the forestry sector. The Bloc Québécois is no longer a party of the regions. We must say no to this hypocrisy and bring back common sense.</ParaText>

As a seasoned volunteer, Ms. Poulin followed wherever her convictions and deep faith in democracy led her.

This victory represents a mandate to implement the promised economic and constitutional reforms, including addressing long-standing demands, such as returning state-acquired lands in the north to their rightful owners.</ParaText>

Yesterday, Campaign 2000 published its national report card, and under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, child poverty jumped 2.5% between 2021 and 2022, the largest annual increase on record for the second straight year in a row. With the cost of food up 35% since the government took office, it is no wonder nearly one in five children, totalling 1.4 million, is living in poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718388">Here is some breaking news: Canada has failed to improve its ranking on the climate change performance index.

              <ParaText id="8718390"> Mr. Speaker, here is an epic story to inspire us all. It is about compassion, passion and integrity immortalized in the movie <I>Chariots of Fire</I>, with an important Canadian connection. One hundred years ago at the 1924 Paris Olympics, Scottish sprinter Eric Liddell, son of missionaries, refused to run on a Sunday to compete in his signature race, the 100-metre sprint. Instead he ran the 200-metre and 400-metre events, winning bronze and gold, the gold in world record time. Liddell exemplified the very best of athletics, and his faith and sport gave him a platform to help others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718391">A year after winning Olympic glory, he returned to China as a missionary, teacher and mentor. When war approached, he sent his wife, Florence, and daughters back to Canada. He never saw them again. Liddell died in a Japanese internment camp, aged 43. We join his family in Canada to celebrate his life. His legacy endures.</ParaText>

Sudbury is a success story in combining environmental stewardship with economic development. Canada's mining industry creates close to 700,000 direct and indirect jobs, and we are just getting started. Mining contributes $161 billion to Canada's economy. That is close to 8% of the country's GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718393">At this time of global uncertainty, developing a reliable supply chain for critical minerals is vital to Canada's economic growth, peace and security. Critical minerals and mining are at the centre of the clean-energy transition. With over 300 mining supply, technology and innovation businesses, Sudbury, I am proud to say, is at the heart of this effort.</ParaText>

While the RCMP has uncovered foreign criminal activity in Canada, the Conservative leader prefers to close his eyes and repeat empty slogans in the House.

Every other party leader of the House has acted with vigilance by obtaining their security clearance to stay fully informed.</ParaText>

First, there was the transfer to medium security, in the dead of night, to a jail with cushy conditions, including a hockey rink that doubles as a tennis court. No advance notice was given to victims. The latest issue is that the victims, including the French family and the Mahaffy family, are now being told that they cannot attend Bernardo's hearing next week in person. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718400">To present their victim impact statement in person is a right that every victim should have. The Parole Board's reason is security, but it will not say what security is at issue. Correctional Service Canada has an army of officers available to assist, but it chose to hide and to obfuscate. Why is that? I believe it is because they want to hide the truly lax conditions of Bernardo's incarceration. They bend over backward for Paul Bernardo while ignoring the basic rights of the victims' families. </ParaText>

At the same time, we brought in a price on pollution that puts more money back in the pockets of eight out of 10 Canadians while cutting emissions and inspiring and encouraging innovation. Unfortunately, the NDP has not been clear even on something as simple as the price on pollution. On this side of the aisle, we stand up for protecting Canadians from climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718620">As the Speaker indicated yesterday, “the Chair seeks the co-operation of all members to be judicious in choosing to wear buttons or pins and to be equally judicious in choosing to raise their concern with the Chair”. We do have some additional guidance on the matter from previous Speakers. In particular I would like to draw the attention of members to a ruling made on May 15, 2014, which states:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The general rule, of course, is that pins and paraphernalia are not to be worn if it causes disruption to the House. I am a bit concerned about the point of order being raised now because these pins have been worn for at least a week or 10 days, as has been my observation, to this point in time. Therefore, I am having some difficulty accepting any suggestion that it is causing disruption, because if it was, points of order would obviously have been raised earlier in this process.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718622"> I would like to point out that many of us have been wearing the pins for many, many months now without comment. I would also like to state that this point is critical and should inform how we move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718623">First, it is disingenuous and beyond belief for members to wake up one day and decide that the wearing of pins has been accepted and that while it has been in use for months it is now somehow causing disruption. If something is disruptive, it is disruptive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718624">Second, while I do appreciate that disorder and disruption have always been and will continue to be the standard by which pins and indeed broader behaviour are judged, we do need to be guided by the Deputy Speaker's intervention in 2014 when he said explicitly, “I am having some difficulty accepting any suggestion that it is causing disruption”. Disruption in and of itself should not mean that a pin is out of order. It is vital that we do not normalize in the chamber a scenario where the loudest and most disruptive voices can use their own disruption to try to force the Chair's hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718625">Third, we should be guided by the fundamental principle of freedom of speech, the protection of which is one of the prime responsibilities of the Speaker. As <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> states at page 317:</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Mr. Speaker, therefore as demonstrated by the tweet and by the agreement from the Conservatives that is coming from across the way, the Speaker's chair, not you although in this particular case filled by you, but the role of whoever happens to be sitting in the chair, is not being treated in an impartial and non-partisan way.</ParaText>

I am greatly worried about the impartiality of the Chair. If we continue to allow the practice to occur, years from now Speakers will continue to be subject to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718643"> I will end my comments with where I started, which is that one of the most important things of our democracy, of our chamber and of the way this place functions is that the people who sit in the chair and the people who work at the table are completely impartial and do not bring a political agenda to their role. They sit there and do their job as servants of the other MPs of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718695">Mr. Speaker, I will present one final petition, regarding the situation in Burma. The petitioners draw to the attention of the House the horrific crimes of the military junta in Burma, with the continuing indiscriminate killing, torture, rape, imprisonment, displacement of civilians and air strikes targeting civilians and vital humanitarian supplies. They note that the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise accounts for a majority of the funding the military receives that enables its ongoing campaigns against civilians, that Canada has an obligation to support the people of Myanmar, as it has outlined in the context of its responsibility to protect and its obligations to the Rohingya and other persecuted minorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718696">Therefore, the petitioners want the Government of Canada to call for an immediate end to executions, atrocities and human rights abuses by the Burmese junta. They want to see humanitarian aid delivered in a cross-border way through opposition-controlled areas instead of through areas controlled by the military junta. They want to see technological and logistical support for communications infrastructure to help the opposition, the NUG and other opposition elements that are successfully defending themselves and the people against the junta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718697">The petitioners would like to see the government impose sanctions against the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, including blocking direct and indirect oil and gas purchases that support the Burmese regime. They also want more collaboration with pro-democracy groups promoting the work of the NUG and reconciliation among the various communities in Burma that are working together to advance a free, pluralistic democracy. Petitioners are calling for tougher sanctions against the junta, cross-border aid and support for the democracy movement. </ParaText>

The Commission of Inquiry into the Use of Drugs and Banned Practices Intended to Increase Athletic Performance held public hearings in 1989 for the purpose of inquiring about athletes' use of drugs, especially anabolic steroids, and of studying the effects of these drugs on the performance of users and the consequent potential to harm their health. The conclusions and recommendations of this commission were an important first step toward addressing these issues.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8718737">Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise in the House to deal with this privilege motion. For those watching, just to help us understand where we are, the House, with a majority of MPs, passed a motion in June. It demanded that all documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, otherwise known as the Liberal billion-dollar green slush fund, be tabled with the law clerk of the House of Commons and be transferred to the RCMP for investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718738">It gave the government, the Liberals, 30 days to do this. They did not comply. As a result, on the first day back in the fall, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege. The Speaker agreed that members' privileges had been breached and that the government had ignored an order of the House. The government decided, yet again, to ignore a majority of MPs of the House, representing a majority of Canadians. Why did the Liberals ignore this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718739">It is true that they have tabled 29,000 pages of documents, as the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> said yesterday; most of them are what is called redacted. What that means is that they are censored, 29,000 pages of black ink. There was so much black ink that the government had to commission the printing presses at the Toronto Star to black out all the secrets they are trying to hide about Liberal insiders who funnelled $400 million of taxpayer money to companies they had a financial interest in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718740">We have been extensively asking questions in the House and in committee, and the government and Liberal members have been trying to cover it up. They continue to do so. In fact, yesterday, I asked a question in the House about the interest of the radical Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> in profiting from the Liberal green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718741">I asked that question, as did my other colleagues on other Liberal scandals, and the Liberal MP who occupies the Chair in question period thought that the language we were using offended Liberals. I can tell everyone that Canadians are offended by the corruption and by the obstruction of justice by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718742"> For six months since that order, the government has refused to table the unredacted and uncensored documents, the 29,000 pages of hidden Liberal secrets. It must be really bad. I asked questions about the particular individual who sits in cabinet, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718743">Prior to his election in 2019, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> was an in-house lobbyist for a venture capital company in Quebec called Cycle Capital. In the four years prior to his election in 2019, he lobbied the federal government; the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office; the Prime Minister's principal secretary, Gerald Butts; the industry department; the industry minister's office; and many other government departments. He did this 47 times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718744">What was his reward for that? The owner of Cycle Capital gave him shares in the company. How do we know that? We know that because the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> declares on his ethics reports that he owns shares in Cycle Capital. The owner of Cycle Capital was appointed to the board of the Liberal green slush fund by former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718745">We remember Navdeep Bains. He is the one from industry who left government early and is now an executive at Rogers Communications, the most expensive cellphone company in the world. He was in charge of reducing cellphone bills while minister of industry, and his reward for seeing cellphone bills escalate was a nice, cushy, fat corporate job at Rogers. If that is not an ethical challenge for people, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>'s ownership of these shares as a reward for his lobbying for Cycle Capital is. The owner of Cycle Capital was on the board in 2016.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718746"> During the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>'s career prior to politics, when he lobbied the government, companies owned by Cycle Capital received over $100 million from the Liberal green slush fund. They received money from the BDC. They received money from EDC in what is called fund of funds. They were investors in these funds. The Minister of Environment was rewarded with these shares. He has refused all invitations by parliamentary committees to come and explain himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718747">I raised the question yet again in the House, which offended many Liberals. I can tell members what offends Canadians. It is the graft and corruption that goes on with the Liberal government. The government seems to accept it and think it is just fine. The Liberals think it is okay to give $400 million of green slush fund money to people appointed to the board by the government, and they voted to give that money to companies they own. That is okay for them. They can just cover it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718748">The privilege motion was agreed to by the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> on September 26. We are about to be in December, and then into next year. It would be a nice Christmas present for Canadians for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to come clean, stop censoring the documents and release the documents. He will not do that. However, he stands in the House, as he did today, complaining that the important work of the ineffective programs the Liberals are proud of, such as the housing decelerator program, is being held up because Conservatives continue to press for honesty, for integrity, for the government to not put itself above the House of Commons and for it to obey the order of the House. It refuses to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718749">From September to December, it will have been four or five months in which the House has debated this. It will go on. The way to stop this is for the government to actually obey the order of the House, the Conservatives, the Bloc and the NDP. The majority of members of Parliament voted for the release of these documents. It has not received much media coverage. We had $16 glasses of orange juice receive much more media coverage than this. The mainstream media are not covering this, although online media are covering it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718750">Shockingly, yesterday, The Globe and Mail wrote an editorial on this. I will quote what it said. I will not read the whole thing, because I know that Liberal members read it intently and then quietly kept their heads down in question period, hoping no one would notice. Here is what The Globe and Mail said is the actual cause of what is going on here in the House. It said, “But the actual cause is the Trudeau government's contemptuous refusal—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718759">It must be really bad. We know about the financial interests of the radical Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. Since that radical Liberal environment minister joined cabinet, the company that he owns shares in has received another $17 million from taxpayers. The value of Cycle Capital has gone up 600% since he started to lobby his friends in the PMO to get money into the company that he owns shares of. I would have thought a person with strong ethics, on becoming <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, would have sold the shares in an environmental venture capital firm to ensure no actual, or appearance of, conflict, but as we know, from the two Randys onward, that is not much of a concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718760">Early on, we heard lots of excuses from the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government house leader</Affiliation> in a vain attempt to say only the police can ask for documents or turn over documents. Of course, that was disposed of quickly by most members of the House who said that any company that discovers inappropriate action is free to turn over its documents to the police for investigation, which is what we are doing here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718761">However, the Prime Minister's department, called the Privy Council Office, said for departments to use the Privacy Act to exempt and censor the documents. However, the Privacy Act actually says that, for a body that can order the production of documents, such as Parliament, the Privacy Act cannot be used as an excuse to exempt information. If a body that has the power to demand documents has that power, the Privacy Act does not apply, yet the Prime Minister's office uses that as an excuse to direct every government department to do differently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718762">Just in case anyone is saying that this is kind of arcane, there is an act that created this organization: the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act. Section 7 of the Conflict of Interest Act says, “No public office holder shall, in the exercise of an official power, duty or function, give preferential treatment to any person or organization based on the identity of the person or organization that represents the first-mentioned person or organization.” An example of a “public office holder” is somebody who has been appointed by the government to the board, while being on the board is an example of the “exercise of an official power”. What that means in “lawyerese” is that, if someone sits on the board of SDTC, they cannot profit by being on that board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718763">What did the Auditor General find out? The Auditor General did an audit for five years of SDTC. She did a sample of only about half the transactions, 226 transactions, that the board approved, and the Auditor General found that 186 of the 226 transactions, in other words 82% of all those transactions, were conflicted. That was not a mistake. That was not bad lawyerly advice. That was people coming in and out and voting for each other's stuff.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718764">That is a culture of conflict of interest driven by a chair who was appointed by Navdeep Bains, over the objection of the then CEO because the chair's company was already doing business with SDTC. The chair said not to worry, that they can manage the conflicts. Well, the way they managed conflicts was to take 82%, or $400 million, and stuff it into their own pockets. One of the beneficiaries of that was the accelerated value of those shares of Cycle Capital owned by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. Perhaps that is the reason the government will not release the unredacted documents. Perhaps they show the extent to which that minister is involved in this corruption and the unethical breaches of acts of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718765">The minister at the time, Mr. Bains, has appeared before committee. His deputy at the time, a fellow named Knubley, appeared this week. For those who remember <I>Hogan's Heroes</I>, there was a character called Sergeant Schultz. Sergeant Schultz always said, “I know nothing” when confronted by Hogan on things. Well, former minister Bains could not remember anything about SDTC, even though he appointed all of these people, and even though one month after former minister Bains left cabinet and joined CIBC, one of the people who worked at SDTC went to work at CIBC. However, he does not remember anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718766"> The deputy minister, Mr. Knubley, could remember the résumé of Annette Verschuren, the Liberal-appointed chair, back to grade six.

              <ParaText id="8718767"> Mr. Knubley said that ADM Noseworthy had been there to be his eyes and ears on what was going on and that not every deputy minister believes in that, but he did, so he had a person there all the time. I asked whether, when 82% of the time the board members were voting for money for their own companies, ADM Noseworthy, as his eyes and ears, had told him about it and if he had told the minister. Mr. Knubley answered that he did not remember. He did not remember having discussions with him on it. Then, he said that he did remember that the act needs to be changed and that he had specific ideas about how the act needs to be changed. I asked if the act needs to be changed to allow for conflicts of interest, since it does not allow for it now, and he said that he was not that familiar with the act.</ParaText>

It was the devil that made him do the PMO appointments and he was just a puppet. The Prime Minister said they have freedom, but apparently not. Navdeep Bains said he did not appoint anyone; he was just doing what the PMO told him to do.

The witness is under indictment in the United States on very serious charges for which she has been advised by her legal counsel to not speak about the material facts of her activities, which are before the courts, for fear of self-incrimination. While the House does have the authority to compel responses from witnesses at committee, this matter is being considered before a court in another country that may not agree that witness testimony is protected under our privileges. It could therefore be used as evidence against her.</ParaText>

While we want to get to the bottom of the witness's actions, we believe that at this time it would be premature for the Speaker to find a prima facie breach of privilege and that a reasonable approach, given these circumstances, would be for PROC to undertake a study of its own volition to provide recommendations on how to deal with this unique situation.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278623" Type="2">Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8718815"> Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege and an honour to rise and speak on behalf of the great people of Vancouver Kingsway and to bring their voices, opinions and concerns to the floor of the seat of their national government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718816">Having had the privilege of representing these great constituents for a number of years now, I have a very good sense of what their expectations are of members of the House. I know that, regardless of their political hue, whether they are Conservatives, Liberals, New Democrats, Greens or some other partisan supporter, they expect the people they send to the House to act with honesty and integrity. They expect them to address their minds to the pressing issues of the day, the issues and policies that affect 40 million Canadians from coast to coast, who struggle each day to put food on the table, to put a roof over their heads, to support their families, to pursue their education, to pursue their dreams and to realize their potential. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718817">Members may have noticed that New Democrats have not gotten up to give speeches very often on this matter. That is because, frankly, most of what I just said about what the people of Vancouver Kingsway expect has been violated in the House for the last six weeks. For the people watching and for my constituents, I will give a brief summary of what has been going on for the last six weeks to explain why we are here and what brought us to this moment in time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718818">We are debating issues that go right to the heart of a lack of integrity, a lack of honesty in government and a refusal of many members of the House to put their minds, skills and efforts to addressing the real issues affecting people. We are here because we have a sordid story of corruption, scandal and misspending, which is not surprising if one looks at the history of the Liberal Party and its governing of this country. It is horrible misspending, inexcusable misspending, of taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718819">In this case, it concerns the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, which was established in 2001 and was afforded a little over $1 billion in 2021 over a five-year period. Through an Auditor General report and spot audit of this fund, alarming facts came to the fore. Dozens of cases of conflicts of interest were identified, 90 in fact, totalling about 80 million taxpayer dollars. A question was raised about whether the people who were making decisions to allocate those funds, all appointed by the Liberal government, were giving them to companies that they themselves controlled or that they were connected with in some way, which is obviously a blatant conflict of interest, or at least an apparent conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718820">About $60 million was given to 10 projects that were not even eligible when the Auditor General took a closer look. Frequently, the projects that were approved and received millions of dollars of taxpayer funds overstated the environmental benefits that came to pass. In fact, over the past six years, SDTC has approved over 225 projects worth about $836 million, and although the Auditor General only did a spot audit on a sampling of them, she found consistent, pervasive and repeated conflicts of interest, misspending and wasteful spending. The Auditor General put the blame squarely on the Liberal minister responsible for this fund and said there was a lack of oversight. Imagine that. This was a fund of almost a billion dollars, and there was a lack of oversight by the Liberal minister who was supposed to make sure that funds were spent in accordance with the authorization of Parliament. That did not happen. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718821"> The Ethics Commissioner is now investigating the former chair of the SDTC fund, Annette Verschuren. She approved two grants greater than $200,000 to a private firm that she directed. She did not recuse herself. She actually participated in the decision of SDTC to approve those grants. I do not think we have to be a lawyer or particularly informed on ethics issues to know that we should not sit in judgment in a case where there is money that could go to our personal benefit if we are actually charged with protecting the public interest. That case is being investigated as we speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718822">In this case, the NDP joins with all parliamentarians, particularly on the opposition side, who are horrified. Frankly, we condemn this kind of wasteful spending and absolutely scandalous corruption. The official opposition has put forth a motion demanding documents from the government so that we could get to the bottom of it, as is Parliament's right. The New Democrats also joined with the official opposition and, I believe, the Bloc Québécois when we supported that request and demanded production of documents to the House so that Parliament can exercise its constitutional and historical duty to scrutinize spending of the government and to hold government accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718823">The Liberals demurred. They did not want to do that. It resulted in a motion calling for the Speaker to find a violation of privilege in that refusal to produce those documents. The Speaker agreed with the request to have those documents produced here. Parliament is supreme. Parliament does have the right to have those documents produced. I think that transparency, accountability and respect for our constitutional obligations support the New Democrats and the opposition members in that quest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718824">This is where it gets a little bit funny. The government is prepared to produce documents to the House, but they want to redact them to some degree. This is a consistent and common theme of government, where they want to redact for certain reasons. Some are more legitimate than others, in my view. Sometimes it is to protect commercial information. Sometimes it is for national security. Sometimes it is to save their political bacon. I am not sure which is the case in this until we see the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718825">The official opposition, though, is not happy with that. They want all the documents, unredacted, to go directly to the RCMP. That is where it gets a little bit confusing, because the government has refused to do that, saying that while Parliament has the right to have documents produced to it, it is unprecedented to demand production of documents to a third party. There is also an issue of whether the police forces, in this case the RCMP, might have their investigation compromised by having documents produced to them in that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718826">In any event, we have had a standstill for six weeks. Instead of working productively, I would say, like responsible parliamentarians, to resolve this issue and conform with the Speaker's direction to send those documents to PROC, which is a committee of Parliament, to work these out, the Conservative opposition has decided instead to bring the work of the House of Commons to a grinding halt for six weeks. For six weeks, the Conservatives have not allowed a single piece of the people's business to move forward in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718827">A former colleague of mine, Nathan Cullen, used to famously say that the currency of Parliament is time. We only have a certain amount of time to address the issues that are important to Canadians. Every hour counts, yet the Conservatives have decided it is more important to them to have not a single issue move forward in the House for six weeks, not on housing, not on inflation, not on international trade, not on foreign affairs, not on issues that affect every single Canadian in every community in this country. Not a single issue important to Canadians has been allowed to move forward while they filibuster and debate a motion in the House that could easily be ended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718828">In terms of cost, I am told that the filibuster the Conservatives are engaging in costs us $70,000 an hour. That is about a million dollars per day. By my calculation, that means the Conservatives have cost the House about $20 million over the last six weeks. In my view, that pales in comparison to the cost to Canadians of refusing and failing to deal with the real issues that they are facing, that my constituents are facing in particular.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718829"> I want to delve into a couple of those issues we could and should be dealing with. Some information came out recently, in the last week, showing that the price of groceries and the price of rent have gone up 20% and 21% respectively over the last three years. From September 2021 to September 2024, food has gone up 20% and rent has gone up 21%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718830">Figures came out the day before yesterday that showed, when comparing October of last year to October of this year, so just in the last 12 months, the price of rent has gone up 7.3% for Canadians; the cost of shelter, which includes mortgage interest and all other forms of paying for accommodation, has gone up 4.8%;and the price of food has gone up 2.7%. For three consecutive months, food inflation has exceeded the headline target of 2%. Remember, that is on top of the stratospheric increase of the cost of all these things that has already happened in the last three years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718831">People are struggling. People are cutting back on their grocery bills. It is not just working families, but middle-class families are cutting back on their food. Parents are skipping meals so they have enough money to make sure their children can eat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718832">In my hometown of Vancouver, it is not uncommon for people to have to spend between $2,000 and $2,500 per month to rent a one-bedroom apartment. Two-bedroom apartments cost between $3,800 and $4,500 per month. These rents are absurd. People are being driven out of the communities they grew up in, businesses cannot find workers to staff their enterprises and people are having to move out of the cities they want to live in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718833">I have heard a lot in this place about Conservatives blaming the Liberals and their inattention to housing, and that is well placed. The Liberals have been in power for 10 years, and I can say it is absolutely the case that housing affordability has become worse in the last 10 years. I do not think there is a community in this country that would come forward and say housing affordability has become better in the last 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718834">However, it also wrong just to blame it on the Liberals. This is a problem, at least where I live in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, that started well before this. The housing crisis did not start in 2015, so I pulled some statistics to see if my intuition was correct and will share what I found. I checked the Greater Vancouver Realtors, which has been watching statistics for many decades. It tracks the prices of varying forms of housing, in this case a single detached house, and it does that for the entire Lower Mainland, from Squamish in the north to White Rock in the south, where millions of people live. What it found is that the average price of a single detached house in the year 2000 was $380,000. In 2004, it was $600,000. In 2008, when the Harper government came to power, it was $800,000. In 2012, it was $1.2 million. In 2016, just when the Harper Conservatives left office, it was $1.6 million. In 2020, it was $2 million, and in 2024, it is $2.25 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718835">What does that mean? When the Harper Conservatives were in power between 2006 and 2015, the price of a house in Vancouver went from $800,000 to $1.6 million. It doubled. The greatest increase in housing cost that happened in the last 25 years occurred under the Harper government, under the Conservatives' watch. When they come here and say that the housing crisis is all the Liberals' fault, it is the Liberals' fault from 2015 on, but it did not start there. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718836">That is the kind of issue the people of my riding have sent me here to deal with. They want to know how we can make sure that everybody has a secure, affordable and decent place to live. There are thousands of issues in politics, and they are all important, but some are foundational. Housing is one of them. Housing is not a luxury. It is a necessity. It anchors people in community. It makes it possible for people to access all of the civil rights and duties that they want, like to find a place to work, to send their children to school, to connect with neighbours and to build community. They all require a stable, secure, affordable home, and that is an illusion for far too many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718837">People under the age of 30 in this country should be furious, because people under the age of 30 in this country cannot find a place to rent that is affordable, and the dream of home ownership is almost completely gone. That is a failure of policy that should be laid at the foot of every single federal government, of both Conservative and Liberal hue, going back several decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718838">I just want to talk for a moment quickly about scandals. The funny thing is we are talking about Liberal scandals. It is a genuine Liberal scandal, but I was here when the Harper government actually self-destructed on its own after many scandals. I have heard Conservatives say they were not here at the time. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party was here. He was in cabinet the whole time the scandals were happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718839">The Conservatives say that was then and this is now. The best predictor of how the Conservatives will govern next time is how they governed last time. What happened then? They blew $2 billion with the Phoenix pay scandal. They did not even ask anybody about it. They just decided to contract out and privatize human resources in the public service. It bungled. It did not work and they are still trying to clean up the mess today. It was $2 billion wasted. That happened twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718840">There were two times the Conservative government was found in contempt of Parliament. It was the first government in the history of Canada to be found in contempt. In the greatest irony of all, it was for refusing to produce documents. The Conservative government refused to produce documents in the Afghan detainee scandal and documents that underpinned their so-called tough-on-crime legislation. When this Parliament demanded, by majority vote, when Parliament was supreme, for the Harper government to produce documents, it refused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718841">We have Conservative after Conservative getting up, spouting respect for principle, demanding that Parliament is supreme and demanding the production documents. The Conservatives did not do it when they were last in government; they will not do it when they are in government again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718842">There was a $400-million G8 scandal. We all remember the $80,000 gazebo by former Minister Tony Clement, who, by the way, had to resign because of a sexting scandal after he was extorted because of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718843">There were Conservative logos on government cheques when they were handing out taxpayer dollars in a cheap attempt to blur partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718844">There were four Conservative senators suspended. The Mike Duffy affair happened, where the legal counsel to the former Prime Minister wrote a cheque for $90,000 to pay the legal expenses of Senator Mike Duffy. I do not know who pays $90,000 in legal expenses for people they barely know, but they did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718845">Two Conservatives had to resign for election cheating. There was Peter Penashue and Dean Del Mastro, who was taken away in handcuffs and jailed for cheating in elections. There was the robocall scandal and the in-and-out scandal. They lost $3.1 billion of $12.9 billion in funds allocated to public safety and anti-terrorism initiatives. It took the Treasury Board six months to try to track the money down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718846">That is the record of the Conservatives who are standing up here today, attempting to be the moral and ethical leaders of this country. I say to Canadians, if they want to look and see how the Conservatives will be next time, take a look at how they acted last time. They will find a record of corruption, dishonesty, lack of ethics and poor governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718847">If Canadians really want to elect a party that would actually do the work of the people of this country, then they would vote a New Democratic government in for the first time in history. We would spend our time working on the real issues facing Canadians every day, not this kind of back-and-forth corruption that we see from the two old-time parties in this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718850">Mr. Speaker, the answer is simple: Both parties are wrong in this case. The Liberals should be producing the documents you have ordered and should not be redacting them. The New Democrats agree with our colleagues in the Conservative and Bloc parties when they say the government has to be forthright and produce the documents that will probably implicate it and be embarrassing for it. The documents will probably show that there has been terrible misspending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718851">The Liberals are wrong to withhold the documents from the House. They should be sitting down and negotiating an acceptable option.

              <ParaText id="8718854">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that every opposition member elected to this place, especially in a minority Parliament, has a decision to make. They have to decide whether they are going to use their time and effort to attack, to destroy and to obtain nothing, or use their seat, voice and effort, roll up their sleeves and try to obtain benefits for Canadians. That is what I did and what the NDP did, with 25 MPs, by the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718855">With 25 MPs, we secured dental care for nine million Canadians. We secured diabetes medication potentially for six million Canadians and contraception for 10 million Canadians. If we add that together, we are talking about 24 million Canadians who are going to get access to health care they do not have today. We got anti-scab legislation passed. We pushed the government to get 10 days of paid sick leave. We used our efforts to get these real, tangible results for Canadians. Frankly, the programs are still being implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718856">There is one thing I have asked the Conservatives repeatedly in the House and they will not answer: Will they cancel the dental care program that seniors right now are using to get their teeth fixed? Will they cancel the pharmacare program that is going to bring relief to people with diabetes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718857">The Conservatives want an election. Why would the New Democrats hasten a potential election that would hasten the Conservatives' getting rid of programs that are helping millions of Canadians? That is not what I was sent here to do.

              <ParaText id="8718864">Mr. Speaker, the core of the issue is that the matter be referred to the procedure and House affairs committee. That is the vote that needs to take place and that would get rid of the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718865">The reason it would go to the procedure and House affairs committee is that a great amount of concern has been raised by the RCMP, the Auditor General of Canada and other legal experts, who are saying that it would be inappropriate for us to hand unredacted documents directly to the RCMP. That was not necessarily known at the time the original motion was passed. Some people have suggested that it could even potentially be an abuse of power. This brings us back to the original motion. Let us get PROC to make a decision so that we, collectively as a House, do not do something that would potentially be against the charter rights of individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718866">Does the member believe that the Liberal government should be listening to the Conservatives on the issue or listening to the RCMP, the Auditor General of Canada and other legal experts who are telling us not to give the information directly to the RCMP?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8718867">Mr. Speaker, it is a valid concern. I have read about the same concerns from police forces. It is unusual, in fact I think unprecedented, for Parliament to order documents to be delivered directly to a police force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718868">Having said that, I am not sure it is illegal and I am not even sure it is necessarily impossible to do. Our police forces and the RCMP are used to executing subpoenas. They are used to getting documents. They will work with the Crown to see what the documents can and cannot be used for, subject to constitutional and charter rights. The police are used to dealing with that all the time, so I am not necessarily as convinced as my hon. colleague is that it cannot be done. It should be explored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718869">The real question the Liberals have to answer is what they are doing about the SDTC waste of millions and millions of dollars. I have not seen any ministerial accountability for that yet. A minister of the Crown was finally removed from cabinet today, but that is totally separate from the matter at hand. I have not seen any ministerial responsibility answerable to the taxpayers for the egregious waste of millions of taxpayer dollars through the Sustainable Development Technology fund, and that is something I would like to hear from my hon. colleague. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8718870"> Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to have the opportunity to rise in the House and to be recognized by the Chair. The circumstances, though, are unfortunate. We are talking about a $400-million scandal, over 186 conflicts of interest and a lawful order from the majority of democratically elected members of Parliament, passed in the House, ordering the NDP-Liberals to hand over to the RCMP the documents pertaining to the scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718871">What they would like to do is turn the documents and the matter over to a committee. I find that wholly insufficient, and that is what I have heard from Canadians when I have talked to them, when they have called me and written to me about the matter. They want to know, when a crime is committed in their community, for example if someone steals $100, $1,000, $10,000 or breaks into a home, whether they are supposed to call a committee or supposed to call the cops. The answer is, of course, to call the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718872">It is $400 million dollars that is involved, and it is interesting to note that this is what has been detected thus far, because the Auditor General reviewed only a sample in the SDTC matter. The actual malfeasance, misappropriation, theft and embezzlement that has gone on would be much, much higher than $400 million. That is exactly what the police would find out, and that is exactly why the Liberals are refusing a lawful order of Parliament to hand the documents over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718873">Every day, there is a new scandal with the Liberals. Today we started the day talking about the Liberal member from <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton</Affiliation> who had shady business dealings, his company being sued for fraud for hundreds of thousands of dollars; his company being investigated by the Edmonton Police Service for fraud; and he and his business partner fraudulently applying for government contracts designated for indigenous-owned businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718874">The former minister said he never claimed to be indigenous except when he was applying for the contracts, disenfranchising actual indigenous-owned businesses. He now says he got his previous claims about his heritage wrong. The Liberal former minister said he was not directing his company from the cabinet table, but now we know he was and that what he said was not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718875">He said his company was not applying for any government contracts while he was a minister, but we know it did in fact apply for a contract with Elections Canada, and it was awarded that contract for tens of thousands of dollars. Why would a government department award a contract to someone who sits around the table and decides on the funding and fate of its organization? I wonder why, if it did not advantage the Liberal former minister and disadvantage every other small and medium-sized business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718876">The business he had, by the way, was a pandemic profiteering business, taking advantage of people who were scared during a time of scarcity and great concerns about their health. Today we learned that the Liberal member from <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton</Affiliation> is not in cabinet anymore. He is stepping away from cabinet to spend time with the other Randys.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718877">It is not because the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> recognized that any one of the incidents, including having someone fraudulently claim to be indigenous, having someone have a business that is being investigated by the police for fraud, or having a minister who is directing a company from the cabinet table, would be enough to get them fired from a job in the private sector. Any one of those things would be enough to get them fired from any self-respecting government that was determined to serve Canadians and not just serve themselves and Liberal insiders. No, none of that was enough. However, I will note that Canada's first indigenous attorney general was fired for speaking out against the Prime Minister and his interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. He kicked her out of caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718878"> I wonder how many more days the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> has in the Liberal caucus. The answer should be zero because his behaviour has been reprehensible. It is unbecoming not just of a minister of the Crown but of any parliamentarian. However, the Liberals stood up day after day and defended the indefensible. Some of them will stand up today and ask me questions after this speech. They defended the Liberal minister because it is not about helping Canadians when it comes to the Liberals. That is not their raison d’être.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718879"> What is the Liberals' primary objective? It is to help well-connected insiders, just as in this green slush fund. They are refusing to hand over the documents to the law clerk to go to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Liberals have to protect the insiders. Every time we raised it and identified that there are some serious baddies working at that organization, the Liberals tried to sweep it under the rug, saying they were taking a look at that. No, they were not. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would quite excitedly proclaim that they had restored governance, but they did not. They did such a bad job at remedying the corruption, which they fostered and allowed to fester, that they just folded it into a government department, away from prying eyes and accountability to Canadians and parliamentarians. They did this so that their board chair, their other GIC appointees and their well-connected friends could line their pockets while Canadians lined up at food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718880">That is the thing about the Liberals. They are only ever sorry when they get caught. They said they had it in hand all along, but they are never willing to go far enough to do the right thing for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718881"> Just yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said of the disgraced Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> that he was happy for him to continue in cabinet. Knowing what he knew about all of his false claims and all the alleged criminality at his business, the Prime Minister was happy for him to stay, just as the Liberals are happy for everyone who is involved in SDTC to avoid the prying eyes of the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718882"> What are they so afraid of? I think they are terrified that once RCMP officers get a look at what went on, it is going to be bigger than the $400 million that was identified in the sample examined by the Auditor General's team, with more than 186 conflicts of interest. It is going to be worse. That is the culture that has been allowed, though, under the current NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718883">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself has twice been found guilty of breaking the law while serving as Prime Minister. The now <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Public Safety Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty of breaking the law, as was the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation>. The former finance minister was found guilty of breaking the law while serving as finance minister. The current <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, former parliamentary secretary to the Liberal Prime Minister, was also found guilty of breaking the law. Why is this? It is because they used their positions to help their friends, well-connected insiders and themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718884"> What did Canadians get with nine years of Liberals helping themselves and well-connected insiders? Our national debt has doubled. Home prices, rents and the needed down payment for a home have all doubled. Food bank use is now at a record high. When we talk about the struggles that Canadians have after nine years under the NDP-Liberals, child poverty is at its worst today. Now, 25% of Canadians, as reported by the Liberal government's own stats agency, are going to have to rely on food banks. That is interesting, because 25% is not the unemployment rate. This means that we have millions of Canadians who are working but have to go to the food bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718885"> In my conversations with operators and volunteers at food banks, I hear that they are having a real challenge in keeping up not just with the food-side demand but also with the volunteers needed to operate the food banks. The people who are using their services, who are relying on food banks to feed themselves and their families, now have to go to the food bank between shifts or between jobs. After they finish their first job for the day, they have to go to the food bank and then go to their next job. Therefore, people are working two and sometimes three jobs, but they still cannot afford nutritious food for their families. Man, are these guys ever helping themselves out, making sure that it is sunny ways for Liberal insiders and their well-connected friends but cloudy skies for everybody else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718886">It really makes me wonder why the Liberals do what they do. They say that they have altruistic goals, such as wanting to do something about the environment. Are they going to reduce the carbon footprint, let us say, for the head of government? No, of course they are not. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a high-carbon hypocrite, the likes of which we have never seen. Meanwhile, he is raising the carbon tax on everyday Canadians, with food price inflation in this country outstripping that of our peer nations; he is taxing the farmers who grow the food, the truckers who move it, the grocers who sell it and the people who buy it. We have higher taxes just for the crime of heating our own home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718887">Can we imagine that, in our climate, the government would punish heating one's home? The Liberals say this is a behaviour that needs to be changed. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation>, a Liberal from Toronto, thinks that people out in P.E.I. are going to be taking the subway instead of driving their pickup truck. However, I have news for the Deputy Prime Minister. Whether it is Victoria-by-the-Sea, Prince Edward Island; Victoria, British Columbia; or Athens, Ontario, in my community, no one is getting on the SkyTrain, the subway or a streetcar. They are getting in a minivan to take their kids to hockey, getting in the pickup truck to drive to the job site, or getting in their car to get some groceries or pick up their mom to take her to a doctor's appointment. They are just trying to live their lives. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718888">Meanwhile, it is jet-setting and high-carbon hypocrisy with the Liberals. Of course, they are backed up on every bit of the pain they foist on Canadians by their accomplices in the NDP, who have abandoned working Canadians. While the Liberals impose binding arbitration on workers, we have seen the NDP saying that they are still going to support the Liberals. They have abandoned the very people they purported to represent in order to get elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718889">Let us just take the tally. It is not about helping the environment; it is about helping themselves, jet-setting around the world all the while. It is not about helping Canadians, who just want to get by. They want to afford a good home in a safe neighbourhood, to be able to feed themselves and their families nutritious foods and to have a comfortable retirement someday. We have seen that with the economic vandalism perpetrated on Canadians with the inflationary deficits and monumental waste they have engaged in with the support of the NDP. They have abandoned workers, Canadian families and the Canadian middle class. The dream of people who came to this country long before I was born, as well as those who have aspired to come to it since I was born, was that they would be able to do those things I said: work hard, earn a good paycheque, buy a home in a safe neighbourhood, feed themselves and be able to retire. They believed their kids would do better than they did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718890">I have good news. The picture painted after nine years under the NDP-Liberals sounds pretty gloomy. However, life was not like this before the NDP-Liberal government, and it is not going to be like this after. That is why our common-sense Conservative plan will restore that promise for Canadians. I am so excited about it; I am very optimistic and hopeful for the future of this country, for my five young children, for young children across this country and for people who dream of coming to this land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718891">We know the Liberals have broken so many things, including housing and our immigration system, but we can fix it. All it will take is a carbon tax election to restore the fairness, promise and affordability that Canadians were born with and that people around the world have aspired to enjoy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718892">The Liberals do not want to do the right thing and turn over these documents so that they can be transmitted to the RCMP. They are terrified of what will be revealed. However, it does not mean we are going to stop our important work of holding them to account and making sure that, when a government oversees, presides over and permits, thereby promoting, the kind of fraud and corruption we have seen in this green slush fund, we are not going to abide it. The Liberals want to turn it over to a committee; we want to turn it over to the police, which is the rightful place for it to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718893">Canadians cannot count on the Liberals. They have done a lot of carping about wanting to get on with other things in the House, but this is what we are here to do. I have a really simple solution for the Liberals: They can turn the documents over to the RCMP, and we can get on to those other things.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718929">Madam Speaker, over the last several weeks, all of us have had the opportunity to think about why this place needs to function. This debate has been precipitated because the government has refused to respect the will of this place. This place needs to function as it was designed to function under the Standing Orders and under all the rules and privileges that we are afforded here in this place because, in a lot of ways, democracy can be an illusion if this place does not function. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718930">We are each imbued with power of people. For me, it is close to 120,000 people; I represent that many people. I sometimes think in my head of a Saddledome filled several times over and the responsibility that I have to be the voice of that many people. The rules that we have in this place allow me to speak on their behalf and also prevent Canadians from feeling like they have to settle conflicts or differences or get action through violence. We have to ensure that so many things work here in order to keep our democracy functioning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718931">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation> mentioned an article in The Globe and Mail this week. It was written by the editorial board. It is entitled “A Parliament that is dead on the inside”. In establishing its thesis, the article states as follows, “The House has, as established through the Constitution, the absolute power to order the production of government documents—in this case, documents related to the disgraced Sustainable Development Technology Canada agency.” The government has not complied with an order of the House. Therefore, the Speaker found a breach of members' privileges. Now the way to end this, the way to respect the will of Parliament, is for the government to comply with the order, period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718932">I want to put why this place has to function in a slightly different context. I gave that why, perhaps not explicitly, in a speech that I gave last week at Royal Canadian Legion Branch 284, the Chapelhow legion. I would like to impart to colleagues today why this place has to function and why the government must comply with the House order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718933">Recently, one of our younger colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation>, stood in the House to deliver a tribute to his father, who had passed away unexpectedly. He closed with a call to action, “my hope is that everyone can remember my dad, Jay, by living with the strength, generosity and faith he showed us.” In response and in a rare show of unity, all members of this place rose and gave him a standing ovation. My colleague's hope and the reaction it evoked among us, a divided people often, exemplify a phenomenon I have often seen in moments of grief. Eulogies of remarkable people are never mere lists of accomplishments. Instead, they challenge us to ensure that their work to improve the human condition endures beyond their lives, uniting us to carry their mission forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718934"> More than a century ago, Canadian physician Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae wrote one of the most blunt and enduring calls to action ever contained in a remembrance. In 1915, his friend, Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, fell in combat during the Second Battle of Ypres. After his funeral and noticing the poppies springing up among graves of the fallen, McCrae wrote an elegy entitled <I>In Flanders Fields</I>:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718936"> In his poem, McCrae, who later died in the war, left a solemn charge to future generations: “You will face the same foe we did and you must engage with it, lest everything we, the war dead, have sacrificed for you be in vain. If you succeed, there shall still be beauty and we shall rest easy, but if you fail, there will be no rest for any of us in this life or the next.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718937">If McCrae's mandate to us was clear, the enemy he called us to face was left undefined. One could interpret it as a call to defeat enemy soldiers, but this view seems overly narrow to me. McCrae's words transcend literal war. They speak to a more insidious, pervasive threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718938">In recent years, I have become increasingly concerned that Canadians spend too little time reflecting on McCrae's lament's true meaning, even on Remembrance Day. With division and unrest spreading through our communities, schools and places of worship, I fear many have grown complacent or naive about the foe McCrae identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718939">Years of peace and prosperity have lulled Canadians into thinking the foe can neither take root here nor harm us. Some even see the foe as a friend, believing it worthy of protection rather than something to root out. These are lies that we, particularly in this place, are duty bound to reject if we are to complete McCrae’s task. However, what exactly is the enemy McCrae asked us to confront?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718940">Through my time in public service, I have seen first-hand the worst that humanity can inflict upon itself. I have walked through homes reduced to blackened rubble, where the fresh stench of death and blood spatter were all that was left of families who once inhabited them. I have walked over mass graves. I have met survivors of genocide and sexual slavery, and listened as world leaders attempted to diminish the crimes committed against them. I have witnessed mothers whose starving children limply clung to them in refugee camps, displaced by warfare and disease. I know that all who serve in our military have seen far worse than I have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718941">I know our foe is real, pervasive and intent on our destruction, but I also know the horrors of war, though perhaps its most visible manifestation, do not constitute the foe itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718942">If it is not war, then what is it? I believe the foe germinates in complacency and the false belief that Canada is immune to external threats. It spreads by erasing the hard-learned lessons of past conflicts and convincing us that others will defend our freedom, rendering us unprepared and unwilling to defend it ourselves. It fosters divisiveness and denies the existence of a Canadian identity. However, this assumption that the foe can be ignored or that Canada lacks something worth defending is fatally flawed. In that place of folly, of ingratitude, decadence, arrogance and naïveté, we meet McCrae's foe: the desire to subjugate others and strip away their freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718943">It terrifies me that the foe so obviously lives on in Canada despite McCrae's cautionary words and the sacrifices made by so many who have fought to defend our nation in armed combat. That is because the foe, left unchecked, inevitably leads to the downfall of a free people like us in Canada. If we are truly to honour those who have fallen in defence of our nation, we must accept that opposing the foe is a battle each of us, particularly in this place, is currently engaged in. We must view remembrance as a lifelong charge, a sacred duty to prevent the foe from eroding Canadian freedoms, democratic institutions and our national unity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718944">Like mould spores, the foe lives on every surface of human nature, constantly probing for new hosts to infect. It seeks to divide us and strip us of our birthrights: freedom of speech, the choice of our own path, the right to worship without persecution and the ability to love without consequence. It attempts to deceive us, suggesting that to preserve these freedoms we must abandon our most fundamental responsibility: to do no harm to another.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718945">We must be vigilant on these matters. The foe cannot be appeased and it will not de-escalate. Thus, we must resist the foe within our minds, in our relationships, in our workplaces and in civil society. This is a challenging task. The foe often disguises itself as a virtuous ideology that is wrong to challenge, masking its true intentions. It often attempts to convince us that the only way to protect our freedom is to take away or limit the freedom of others, and yet, hope lies in Canada's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718946"> When McCrae penned <I>In Flanders Fields</I>, Canadian soldiers were fighting for one of the first times as a unified force. During the First World War, soldiers of diverse backgrounds, including over 4,000 indigenous people, fought side by side under the Canadian banner for the goodness our nation represents. In that war, and others that followed, men and women of all faiths fought alongside one another to liberate others from the foe. This unity, the miracle of people setting aside differences to protect the freedom found in our nation, is the foe's greatest fear. That miracle, thankfully, remains alive and well today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718947">We must thank those who have fought for Canada, but we also must renew our commitment to confront the foe here ourselves. How do we quarrel with the foe, as McCrae charged us to do? What must we do to hold it at bay? The foe responds to hard power, making it essential for our nation to be capable of self-defence and for military service to be respected. However, civilians too must bear the responsibility of keeping the foe in check.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718948">We know the foe is deathly allergic to freedom and equality of opportunity, and so we can starve it of the fuel it needs. The foe's oxygen is religious hatred, rigid caste structures, petty jealousies, intellectual laziness, selfishness, political cowardice and autocracy. The foe cannot thrive in a nation in which anyone, of any background, belief or origin, can live without fear of persecution and prosper by the work of their hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718949">Canada and other countries committed to traditions of freedom, democracy and justice, and the rule of law, are humanity's best and only defence against the foe. It is only within those nations where institutions exist that allow us to solve society-scale grievances through words and democratic action instead of with violence that humanity has been able to hold the foe at bay for any length of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718950">We must remember that the foe confronts us every day in small moments, like when we choose to empathize rather than judge, when we bear witness to suffering rather than ignore it and when we temper anger with understanding, but also when we work to correct injustices. Fighting the foe means shedding ideologies that undermine our freedoms. It means thinking critically, challenging the status quo and forgiving when we can. A shared commitment to freedom and decency can transcend many divides, a reminder that the foe seeks to silence us, and it seeks to silence us here, but that we must protect open dialogue as a safeguard against our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718951">Perhaps the most potent weapon against the foe is pride in Canada. Canada is the embodiment of freedom from the foe, a shining example of peaceful, democratic pluralism. We weaken the foe each time we feel pride for our country singing in our blood. Every time we sing the national anthem, every time we wave our flag, wear the poppy or thank a veteran, we strike a blow against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718952">Proud of our nation we should be. Canada offers a promise of freedom and prosperity that tens of millions of people from around the world have migrated to experience. It is the promise Lieutenant-Colonel McCrae fought and died for and the promise he threw the torch to us to protect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718953">Today, the foe seeks to extinguish this pride and make us feel ashamed of the goodness that can be found in our shared Canadian traditions. The foe understands we will not fight to protect something if we do not value it. That is why it tempts us to cancel Canada Day celebrations and seeks to normalize shouts of death to Canada and the burning of Canadian flags in our streets.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718954">That is why it wants us to view the Canadian military uniform as a symbol of oppression instead of the proud armour of liberators it always has been. That is why it seeks to have us erase our nation's history instead of celebrating the good while fixing the bad. It gives me hope that many Canadians of differing political viewpoints, religions and ethnic backgrounds are coming together to reject these lies and defend the institutions that protect our national identity of freedom. People united in freedom, as we can be here in this country, is the foe's undoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718955">When we stand together as Canadians, united in our love for our nation, our freedoms, our democratic institutions, we, the true north, strong and free, truly honour those who have fought and died to protect Canada's promise. When we do this, we defeat the foe. To Lieutenant-Colonel McCrae and to all those who have served our nation across time, we are thankful for what they have done and we give our promise today: We remember, we will take up the quarrel with the foe and we will prevail. God keep our land glorious and free. O Canada, now and always we stand together proudly on guard for thee, lest we forget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718956">I believe this place has forgotten. I believe it has broken faith with those who died. If we do not protect the democratic institution that is Parliament, then we have broken faith. We have let the foe into this institution and it is insidious. We are supposed to think this is not a big deal. It is not a big deal that the government is not respecting the will of the House. We are supposed to believe that the Liberal government does not have a duty to comply with this, that we should just send this to a committee, that we should just let it go, that it is not a big deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718957">At the end of the day, reading the Globe editorial from yesterday, and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation> read the quote at the end, the government is honour bound and duty bound to respect the will of Parliament. If the government does not do that, then our democratic institution is broken. This is a lie. How are we supposed to uphold the principles of democracy that allow our pluralism to thrive, that allow us to solve quarrels without violence, that allow us to uphold freedoms? If we cannot do that here, it is impossible across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718958">That is why we have parliamentary privilege. It is my privilege to stand in this place on behalf of over 100,000 Canadians. If the government is not complying with the will of Parliament, then that privilege has been violated. It is not just my privilege; it is the privilege of every single Canadian. That is the gravity of the situation here. This, to me, is a hill to die on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718959">There is a reason we are demanding that the government hand over these documents, and there is a reason we are asking our colleagues in the other opposition parties to hold the line. There is a greater principle at play here. That principle is whether or not we are going to allow McCrae's foe to seep into our business here, in our naïveté, in our comfort, our decadence and our arrogance, that what happens here does not matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718960">Many people have said this place does not matter anymore, bureaucracy runs everything and there is no ministerial accountability. That may be, but for what I will do, and in the promise I make to people who serve in Canada's military, people who serve abroad, people of all walks of life who have decided to take up the quarrel with the foe, who have caught the torch from failing hands, I will not let that pass. Nor should anyone in this place, regardless of political strife, members of the government backbench particularly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718961">This is the time for political courage. Our democracy is under attack. It is no less than that. There is no amount of hyperbole in that statement. It is the time for political courage. It is the time to hold space and to honour those who have sacrificed to protect the democratic institution in which we are so privileged every day to speak.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718963">When I think of bringing that to the table and of the types of debates we have here on the floor of the House of Commons, I believe that they would believe that, yes, Parliament does have unfettered power. It is an incredible authority that we have as parliamentarians, but it does not give us the right to abuse that power.</ParaText>

I would think that she would share some of those.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718973"> Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague gave a thoughtful speech. She talked a lot about “the foe”, and I am not sure from where, in her view, the foe emanates, but I want to focus and get her opinion on the foe from within. In this country, we have routinely seen the turnout for federal elections at about 60%. That seems to be the norm over successive elections. That means, and pardon my bad math, about half of Canadians do not even think their democracy is important enough to cast a ballot every four years or so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718974">I am wondering what she thinks is the cause of that. My own view is that it happens when there are successive political parties that promise things and then betray their promises, like when the Liberals broke their promise that 2015 would be the last election under first past the post and their promise that they would bring in a universal pharmacare system 25 years ago. When they tell Canadians they will do that sort of thing and then get in government and do not, does she feel that has a corrosive impact on our democracy and drives people away from the democratic process? Is that a legitimate foe she thinks ought to be addressed?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8718984">Madam Speaker, I rise once again to address the sweeping corruption that grips the NDP-Liberal government here in Ottawa. Parliament is consumed with the issue of the Liberal government refusing to turn over unredacted documents to the RCMP for a criminal investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718985">These documents pertain to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, better known as the green slush fund. I have already spoken extensively on this issue, as did the Auditor General, I may add, so I am in good company. I encourage everyone to check out my Facebook and Twitter feeds to see my deep dive into the green slush fund and other Liberal criminal wrongdoings. For example, in today's case, these documents have been blotted out by the Liberals and, as a result, the police are at a standstill, but is this a surprise? In our country, police investigations of possible wrongdoing and criminal activity are not just esoteric questions confined to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cadre of NDP advisers. Crime is real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718986">The government may not take crime seriously, something they are demonstrating here by failing to provide to the RCMP documents that may very well hide criminal actions and connections to Liberal insiders, potentially even Liberal MPs or ministers, but crime is a crisis gripping our nation. It is a crisis that affects every community, family and Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718987">I am speaking about the devastating convergence of drugs and crime, two interconnected issues that have spiralled out of control under the NDP-Liberal government's watch. This crisis is not about abstract statistics. It is about real people. It is about the family grieving the loss of a loved one to a fentanyl overdose, the shopkeeper who no longer feels safe in their store and parents who are afraid to let their children play in local parks because of discarded needles and drug paraphernalia. This is a crisis that touches all of us, and it demands immediate, decisive action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718988">For too long, the Liberal government, propped up by its NDP allies, have implemented reckless ideological policies that have not only failed to solve these problems but also made them worse. Their so-called evidence-based approaches have emboldened criminals, exacerbated addiction and left Canadians feeling less safe in their own communities. It is unacceptable. The Conservative Party offers a clear, common-sense alternative. We believe in holding criminals accountable, in prioritizing recovery over enabling addiction and ensuring that every Canadian can feel safe in their home, their neighbourhood and their workplace. All of this is against the backdrop of a government that commits scandal after scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718989">This discussion here today is only the latest one, which is the refusal of the government to provide the unredacted documents to the RCMP so it can determine if there were actual crimes committed. When we have a federal government so quick to bend the rules, and possibly even commit crimes, is it any wonder that we have a larger crime and drug problem in this country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718990">To address this crisis effectively, we must begin by understanding the root causes. Drug addiction and crime are deeply intertwined, each fuelling the other in a vicious cycle that devastates individuals, families and communities. The opioid crisis is a prime example. Since 2015, Canada has seen an explosion in opioid-related deaths, driven by the rise of synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl. These substances are cheap, potent and deadly. Between January 2016 and September 2022, over 35,000 Canadians lost their lives to opioid overdoses. In my home province, the Saskatchewan Coroners Service recorded eight deaths by fentanyl poisoning in 2016. Deaths by fentanyl poisoning peaked at 272 in 2021, during COVID, and levelled out at 252 in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718991">Addiction is not just a personal struggle. It is also a societal failure. The current government's response has been to normalize and enable drug use through policies such as safe supply and harm reduction. These programs are based on the flawed assumption that addiction is a permanent condition that cannot be overcome. This defeatist mindset ignores the potential for recovery and consigns individuals to a life of dependency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718992">At the same time, our justice system has been systematically weakened. Bills such as Bill <Document DbId="13180632" Type="3">C-75</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> have prioritized the rights of offenders over the safety of law-abiding citizens. These laws have made it easier for repeat offenders to obtain bail, have reduced sentences for violent crimes and have eliminated mandatory minimums for serious offences. The result is a justice system that no longer serves justice. We cannot afford any more years of inaction or misguided ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718993">It is time to chart a course built on accountability, safety and recovery. These are important words. We need accountability here in Ottawa, like today as we debate this motion on the green slush fund and the possible criminal wrongdoing of the NDP-Liberal government in funnelling money through the green slush fund. Why do I say “possible wrongdoing”? Well, it is because the Liberals are blocking this Conservative motion to release the unredacted documents necessary for the RCMP to investigate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8718994">It is amazing that the Liberal Party has prioritized itself and its own selfish needs over the safety of Canadians, selfish needs like funnelling government cash to their friends through the green slush fund. How do I know that? Well, just look at the Liberals' legislative record when it comes to criminal matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718995">The NDP-Liberals passed Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which purposely took accountability and punishment out of the courts. Since the passage of Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, violent crime and drug-related offences have skyrocketed. Repeat offenders, no longer deterred by the threat of significant prison time, have become more brazen. Police officers across the country report increased difficulty in keeping dangerous individuals off the streets, knowing they will likely be released with minimal consequences. Simply put, Bill C-5 replaced prison sentences with conditional sentences, better known as house arrest, for crimes like sexual assault, kidnapping, human trafficking, stealing cars, breaking and entering, arson, assault with a weapon, assaulting peace officers, and trafficking in dangerous narcotics and drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718996">The introduction of house arrest for these serious crimes is quite troubling. House arrest may be appropriate for minor, non-violent offences, but it is entirely inadequate for crimes like sexual assault, kidnapping or drug trafficking. This policy not only fails to hold offenders accountable, but also places an undue burden on victims and their communities. Imagine the trauma of knowing that one's assailant is serving their sentence just blocks away from one's home. One particular harrowing example is the case of a violent offender released on house arrest who subsequently commits additional crimes. This revolving door justice system undermines public trust in the legal system and places innocent Canadians in harm's way. That is why we need accountability restored to our criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718997"> Unfortunately, accountability is lacking in this justice system, which is why common-sense Conservatives brought forward the motion we are debating today to turn this criminal matter over to the RCMP. Indeed, common-sense Conservatives have put forward strong policy proposals on criminal justice matters since the last election. Perhaps the government, which is so intent on avoiding accountability around the criminal wrongdoings of the green slush fund, as well as everyday, common-sense Canadians, would like to hear about them. Perhaps this could distract from other conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718998"> Conservative members have introduced numerous private members' bills designed to correct the failures of Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> and address the broader issues plaguing Canada's justice system. First, Bill <Document DbId="11946621" Type="4">C-299</Document>, the strengthening penalties for sexual exploitation act, seeks to increase the maximum penalty for offences like human trafficking and child exploitation to life imprisonment. While the Liberals redacted their scandals, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="12177676" Type="4">C-321</Document>, the protecting first responders and health care workers act, which proposes harsher penalties for assaults against first responders and health care workers. While the Liberals hid their wrongdoing with redacted documents, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="13165735" Type="4">C-394</Document>, the restoring mandatory sentences for drug trafficking act, which would reinstate mandatory jail time for criminals involved in producing, importing and trafficking dangerous drugs like fentanyl and cocaine. These bills tackle the root causes of rising crime. Rising crime requires urgent solutions, yet the Liberal government chooses in the House to defend redacted records and questionable spending on the green slush fund rather than tackling the root causes of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8718999"> These next two Conservative bills would make sure that criminals stay in prison and do not revictimize people over and over again. Bill <Document DbId="12269389" Type="4">C-325</Document>, the ensuring dangerous offenders stay behind bars act, would prohibit dangerous repeat offenders from serving sentences in the community. Bill <Document DbId="11881876" Type="4">C-296</Document>, the respecting families of murdered and brutalized persons act, would ensure that individuals convicted of heinous crimes, such as the abduction, sexual assault and murder of the same victim, serve life sentences without parole for up to 40 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719000">There is more. While the Liberals were giving money to their friends and hiding the evidence in these redacted documents, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="12566649" Type="4">C-351</Document> to end least restrictive conditions for dangerous offenders, which would ensure that prisoners are confined under conditions necessary for public safety rather than trying to make criminals feel more comfortable. This change would keep dangerous individuals like Paul Bernard, in maximum-security facilities where they belong. I spoke to this bill when it was debated in the House, and the other side voted it down, voting in favour of Paul Bernardo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719001">These private members' bills reflect the core principles of the Conservative Party's broader justice reform agenda. Canadians can count on Conservatives to stop the erosion of public trust in the criminal justice system. The erosion of public trust caused by increasing crime mirrors the corruption and opacity surrounding the green slush fund, both of which harm the fabric of Canadian society, which is my point here today. If the Liberals would simply hand over the unredacted documents, we could get on with business here in Ottawa. We could get on with the important things Canadians are demanding, and one of those things is stopping crime.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8719002"> Our Conservative plan to stop the crime includes the following pillars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719003"> Number one is restoring mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes, drug trafficking and serious sexual offences. Mandatory minimum sentences are essential to ensure accountability and public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719004"> Number two is implementing jail, not bail. Repeat violent offenders would no longer be released back into the community on bail. We would prioritize the safety of law-abiding Canadians over the convenience of criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719005"> Number three is expanding treatment and recovery options. A Conservative government would invest in detox and rehabilitation programs, ensuring that individuals struggling with addiction have a path to recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719006">Number four is supporting law enforcement. We would provide police with the tools and resources they need to combat organized crime and drug trafficking effectively. This includes reversing the NDP-Liberal government's restrictions on law enforcement powers under Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719007">Number five is enhancing victims' rights. Conservatives would ensure that victims of crime are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve. This includes greater transparency in parole decisions and increased support for victims and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719008"> It is important that Canadians understand the Conservative approach to these criminal matters, such as the possible criminal wrongdoing that we are debating here today. Today, we are debating documents that, once this Conservative motion is adopted, will allow the RCMP to conduct a proper and formal probe into NDP-Liberal actions around the so-called green slush fund. Unfortunately, the Liberals have chosen to paralyze Parliament rather than adopt our common-sense motion and release those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719009">While Conservatives propose common-sense solutions, the NDP-Liberals engage in one misguided policy decision after another, and the consequences of misguided NDP-Liberal policies are clear. Violent crime in Canada has increased by 39% since 2015. Homicides are up 43% and gang-related murders have more than doubled. In Toronto, sexual assaults have risen by over 11% in the past year alone. The link between drugs and crime is undeniable. Drug users desperate to fund their habits often turn to theft, burglary and other crimes. Organized crime groups capitalize on this desperation, using drugs as a tool to trap individuals and expand their influence. Public Safety Canada has stated that the illegal drug trade is a key driver of gang violence and organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719010"> The situation is particularly dire in British Columbia, where the government's experiment with decriminalization and harm reduction has backfired catastrophically. Drug overdose deaths in the province have increased by 380% since 2015, and this year alone, B.C. is on track to recording more overdose deaths than in any previous year. The evidence is clear. These policies are not working. The human cost of this crisis cannot be overstated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719011"> Canadians are paying the price for the NDP-Liberal government's failed policies in very real ways. In Saskatoon, the police department's crime map reveals a city increasingly plagued by violence, theft and drug-related offences. Parents in neighbourhoods like Riversdale and Fairhaven tell me that they are afraid to let their children play outside. Small business owners report break-ins and vandalism at unprecedented levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719012"> The opioid crisis has also placed an enormous burden on our health care system. Emergency room visits for overdoses have skyrocketed, straining resources and diverting attention from other medical emergencies. First responders, already stretched thin, are now dealing with an epidemic of overdoses and drug-related violence. The emotional toll on these frontline workers is immense. It is an emotional toll that comes from the challenges of crime gripping our communities. This emotional toll reflects the consequences of a government more focused on rewarding insiders through the green slush fund than on ensuring the safety and well-being of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719013"> Let me repeat the sad statistic of the green slush fund. The Auditor General found 186 cases where board members doled out $400 million with clear conflicts of interest. The Liberals were taking taxpayer money and giving it to their friends and each other. That is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719014">An emotional toll is being paid by Canadians, who are suffering through the current government of the costly NDP-Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The NDP-Liberals have wasted billions of dollars of Canadians' money on wasteful so-called green projects through Sustainable Development Technology Canada. The sad truth is that it is being funded through Canadians' carbon tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719015">All common-sense Canadians know that when we slap a massive carbon tax on the farmer, then on the transport truck bringing the food to grocery shelves and then on the grocery stores themselves, the price of food goes up. It is called inflation, and boy have Canadians suffered through inflation because of the carbon tax. It is simple: Canada is in crisis. Food Banks Canada's 2024 HungerCount report highlights this stark reality. In Saskatchewan, food bank usage has surged by 42% since 2019. Alarmingly, 23% of food bank users in the province are two-parent families and 18% are employed. It is a glaring sign that something is deeply wrong when hard-working Canadians cannot afford basic necessities. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8719016">This crisis is not limited to Saskatchewan; it is a nationwide issue. Since last year, business bankruptcies have climbed 16% while personal bankruptcies are up 14%. Do members know who is not starving? It is the NDP-Liberal insiders, who have funnelled millions of dollars of cash into their pockets from SDTC. That is who. Families and business alike are struggling under the weight of skyrocketing costs and failing policies. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s sunny ways of 2015 have turned into a storm of economic disaster, and it is clear that the government is not worth the cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719017">That is why Conservatives have a plan to restore hope and opportunity. We will axe the tax to lower costs for families. We will build the homes that Canadians desperately need. We will fix the budget to end inflationary spending and we will stop the crime that threatens our communities. Canadians are ready for a change, and it is time for an election to bring it home. Conservatives are ready to fix what is broken and restore a brighter future for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719018">Fixing the budget is part of the solution to increase public trust right here in Canada. Fixing the budget means respecting the demand of Parliament and finally releasing the documents about Sustainable Development Technology Canada, the so-called green slush fund. By releasing the documents to the RCMP, it can address the criminal aspects of this matter, because crime is crime. It does not matter if it is committed in the House by the government or on the street. Crime makes Canadians less secure. While crime rates surge across Canada, it is alarming that the government continues to block transparency around public funds, funnelling taxpayer dollars into dubious projects like this green slush fund instead of addressing public safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719019">The Conservative Party offers a clear, common-sense plan to address the twin crises of drugs and crime. Our approach is rooted in three pillars: accountability, recovery and prevention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719020">First and foremost, we must restore accountability in our justice system. A Conservative government will repeal Bill <Document DbId="13180632" Type="3">C-75</Document> and bring back mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes. These measures will ensure that dangerous offenders are kept off the streets and that justice is served. We will also implement a jail-not-bail policy for repeat violent offenders. Canadians deserve to know that individuals who pose a threat to public safety will remain behind bars while awaiting trial. Restoring such accountability is one step toward a brighter future that must not only stop the crime, but also address the NDP-Liberal government's disregard for fiscal responsibility, epitomized by the green slush fund scandal, which diverted resources from public safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719021">We will also prioritize recovery over enabling addiction. The current government's safe supply program has been an unmitigated disaster, with up to 90% of prescribed drugs being diverted to the black market. The Conservative government will end this program and redirect funding to treatment and recovery initiatives. We will expand access to detox and rehabilitation programs, working with provinces to increase the number of treatment beds and support recovery-oriented systems of care. Programs like the Saskatoon drug treatment court, which offers alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders struggling with addiction, are good examples to follow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719022">Finally, we will invest in prevention. This includes supporting law enforcement efforts to dismantle organized crime networks and reduce the supply of illegal drugs. It also means educating young Canadians about the dangers of drug use and providing at-risk communities with the resources they need to thrive. How can Canadians feel secure when their government prioritizes schemes like the green slush fund over investments in policing and justice reform? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719023">The crisis of drugs and crime demand immediate and decisive action. Canadians are tired of living in fear. They are tired of a government that prioritizes ideology over safety, that experiments with their lives rather than protecting them. They are tired of a government that gives their hard-earned tax dollars to Liberal friends and insiders and covers it all up by refusing to release the documents to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719024">The Conservative Party is ready to lead. We will end the failed policies of the past decade and implement a common-sense approach to crime that prioritizes safety, accountability and recovery. We will bring back mandatory jail time for violent offenders, end taxpayer-funded drug dens and invest in treatment and prevention programs that actually work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719025">It is time to bring it home. It is time to restore safety to our streets, hope to our communities and dignity to every Canadian. I urge my colleagues in the House to join us on this mission. Together, we can build a safer, stronger Canada. </ParaText>

Why will the Liberal government not just provide the unredacted documents as the request was made by Parliament? It is really quite a simple thing to do. They have already produced the documents with all the redactions. Simply undo the redactions and send the same documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719036">They are not going to do this, because of what is contained in the redactions. The information there must be very serious. It must be very damning, potentially, for the government. It probably names people. There are all kinds of things that could be there; we just simply do not know. This is the information that is needed. It is what the RCMP needs in order to investigate properly so it knows whether there in fact was any criminal wrongdoing that should be dealt with further.</ParaText>

The House has been seized with this question of privilege for over a month and a half, and things are at a standstill. We know what the government needs to do to resolve this impasse. It can produce the documents, which the majority of elected members are asking it to do, or it can impose a gag order with the support of another party. This government, however, does not seem to be doing anything at all to break the impasse. It seems like the government is very comfortable indeed with the current situation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719041">Madam Speaker, my colleague raised a very good point. In many ways it does appear as though the government is just very happy to let things go on. The Liberals certainly do not want to provide the documents, as I stated in my last answer, because they are worried about what the documents contain. At the same time, I do not think they have anything better to do either. I think they have run out of ideas, as my colleague mentioned.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719043"> Madam Speaker, my colleague's speech was an excellent one. We are dealing with so many different Liberal corruption scandals concurrently. Just today, a senior member of the Liberal cabinet, who was the only minister from Alberta, resigned. The stack of scandals that is continuing to be investigated with respect to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> is probably the largest that has applied to any one minister in the history of this country.

              <ParaText id="8719046">My colleague does raise a very interesting kind of microcase, and that is of the minister who resigned today. In one person, there are multiple scandals and just a simple refusal to admit that and a refusal to even see what is wrong in that. Finally today he was, I believe, forced out because of public opinion. I am not sure that left on his own he would have resigned, because I think there is just an innate misunderstanding and an inability to see what is actually going on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719049">Over the past month and a half, I have been going through a deeply serious parliamentary crisis, both on a personal and a professional level. It has been troubling me and keeping me awake at night. I am not sleeping well and my relationship with my friends and family is suffering. I no longer see my friends. I have been keeping to myself. My colleagues find me to be difficult and irritable. I am really having a hard time. I wanted to talk about it in the House because this concerns all members of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719050">Quite honestly, I would say that I was naive and a bit ingenuous when I was elected. I put my face on some posters and told myself that I was going to improve the lives of my fellow citizens, that I was going to come to the House to work every day to improve their lives, particularly the lives of Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719051">People are concerned about all sorts of issues, such as the climate crisis, flooding, drought and the housing crisis, which we will talk about later. We are talking about a report from the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities that focuses on the housing crisis. That is quite serious, and people are grappling with this problem every day. The homelessness crisis is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719052">There is the language crisis too. French is disappearing. It has practically vanished from the rest of Canada and is dying in Quebec. Luckily, in a few years, we will have our independence and we will save the French language. In the meantime, however, we have to work within Canada and within our institutions. We have to work every day to improve the lives of our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719053">What has been going on for the last month and a half? I come here every day and sit in my seat. I am no stranger to rehearsals. In the theatre, we rehearse a lot. I have acted in the same show 200 or 250 times. There is a big difference, however, between performing Molière 250 times and listening to 110 speeches on a privilege motion. A lot of the time, these speeches are delivered at a snail's pace to emphasize every word and really waste the House's time. The goal is to make absolutely sure that people get fed up, that they fall asleep, and that Parliament grinds to a complete halt. There is a big difference between Molière or Shakespeare and the stuff that we hear in this place. It is a far cry from Shakespeare or Molière.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719054">I hope everyone understands my dilemma. When I arrived here, I was hoping that we would have debates, that we would put our ideas up against those of the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP. I thought there would be a clash of ideas and debates, that members would launch ideas back and forth, with each idea brighter than the last. I thought this verbal and intellectual clash of ideas would lead to—</ParaText>

                <B> Mr. Denis Trudel:</B> Madam Speaker, I would appreciate not being interrupted. My colleague just broke my momentum, which is annoying. I would ask for a little respect. I am making an effort. I am performing here, unbeknownst to my agent. I should charge for this performance. The public does not usually talk. When people in the audience talk during a performance, they are kicked out, but that is another story. People have less and less respect for audience members who disrupt shows. People pay a lot of money, and they have the right to hear the performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719057">Where was I? This clash of ideas should lead to brilliant, nay, incandescent bills that serve the varied interests of our constituents. That is democracy. At least, that is what it should be. As a separatist, I respect the House as an institution. However, for the past month, I have been robbed, assaulted and abused. I cannot move anything forward for my constituents in Longueuil—Saint-Hubert and for all Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719058">As I was saying, I have been faced with this dilemma for the past month. One minute I was sitting here, and the next I woke up because it was my turn to speak. It has been a month and a half since I have spoken in the House. I was asked to speak about an important issue, a report by the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities on the financialization of housing. “At last”, I thought, “they want to hear from me.” At the time, I was thinking about the fact that my skills and my work as a parliamentarian were being solicited. We put people to work on this file. The Bloc Québécois research team, my colleagues and I worked on this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719059">We worked on the committee's report as well as the housing crisis. We did our homework. That is what I am going to talk about. The financialization of housing is a very important element in this major housing crisis. It is one of the obstacles to solving the housing crisis. The truth is, in Quebec alone, one million housing units need to be built by 2032 or so. One million units need to be built within the next eight years. However, in 2021, a record year, 67,000 units were built.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8719060">This means that, to achieve the objectives that were set by the CMHC and the big banks, to reach market equilibrium, which is one million housing units in Quebec and nearly 3.5 million housing units in the rest of Canada, we would need to build three times more housing units than have ever been built before. Can members imagine the construction sites, the urgency, how far away we are from the target. Can they imagine all the resources that need to be deployed to face the challenge of building three times more housing units a year than we have ever built before, year after year until 2032. It is nuts. If we do not do it, then what?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719061">I am going to talk about homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719062">Homelessness comes up every day in the media. We recently learned that in the past five years, there has been a threefold increase in the number of deaths in the streets in Quebec. Three times more people are dying on the street. They die from overdoses or from the cold, and no one seems to care in the slightest. They are found along rivers, in tents next to sidewalks. Among those people are seniors, workers. The face of homelessness has changed and if we do not address the broader issue of the financialization of housing, which I will come back to later, homelessness will grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719063">I want to talk about homelessness because there is a specific aspect of this issue that directly concerns the government. In the last budget, the government announced a $250-million envelope to put an end to encampments in Canada. Everyone was happy, everyone applauded the good news. Unfortunately, eight months later, with winter approaching, with nights already getting colder and with temperatures dipping below freezing across Quebec and Canada, the money has yet te be paid out. Quebec's share is about $60 million. Quebec is ready to match this amount and invest another $60 million to help house people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719064">We saw that this morning in Montreal. There are people sleeping along Notre‑Dame Street. The city does not know what to do with them any more. Even if they are removed from there, no one knows where to put them. The federal government keeps adding administrative and bureaucratic hurdles. People who want to open shelters are being asked, what colour will the walls be? How big will the beds be? Will the blankets be synthetic or wool? How many pillowcases will be required? How many pencils will be used to register the number of homeless people sleeping at their shelter? It is so dumb. They keep adding forms and hurdles. People are fed up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719065">When it comes time to take care of people, housing organizations in Quebec know what to do. However, these organizations are not like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, X or Elon Musk. They do not have billions of employees who can spend all their time filling out an endless number of forms. The people who work in these organizations want to help other people. They are empathetic and competent when it comes to getting people off the streets and finding them a place to live, when it comes to helping people to improve their circumstances and finding them social housing. We are talking about helping people overcome addictions. We are talking about helping them return to work. Some of these people may be just getting out of prison and they need to reintegrate into society. These organizations know how to do that.

              <ParaText id="8719089"> Madam Speaker, I will admit from the outset it will be hard to follow that act. That certainly was a very impassioned speech. I always enjoy hearing from my colleague in the Bloc when he has thoughts to offer in this place. However, he was absolutely right on a number of issues. I agree completely with him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719090"> For starters, there is the fact that we have not been able to continue to work on the important legislation that Canadians expect us to work on. Let us be honest. For the preceding two and a half years before September, we were able to be an effective government through an agreement with the NDP. We had the opportunity to work with the NDP on common issues, on some issues that were more important to them; on some issues that were more important to us. We had the ability to work together and we got a lot done for Canadians during that time. I think it would be hard to argue against that when we look back at pharmacare, dental care and a lot of other initiatives. Yes, I will give credit to the NDP. The NDP did a very good job at negotiating those and bringing them to the government's attention, issues that many Liberals had also been fighting for within our caucus for quite a long time, at least as long as, if not longer than, I have been around. The point is that we were able to get work done. We were able to actually do something in here and deliver meaningful things for Canadians. I already mentioned pharmacare, and I mentioned dental care. The national school food program is another one, along with $10-a-day child care and making sure that the framework legislation behind that was well established. This is what Canadians have asked us to do by electing us to come and work on their behalf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719091">The member from the Bloc is absolutely right. I felt his sense of defeat about not being able to do anything, of coming here, sitting here and then suddenly realizing it is his time to speak after listening to over 170 Conservatives filibuster over the last 25 or 28 sitting days of this House. What have they been filibustering? They have been filibustering a motion that they introduced into this House. They have been filibustering a motion that asks to send a very important issue to committee. I will not say it is not a very important issue. Then, as soon as they introduced the motion, they said they had no intention of actually letting it pass. Why did they even introduce the motion in the first place? Is this the hill that they are ready to die on? It is easy, because the Conservatives want to give the impression to Canadians that it is impossible to do anything in Ottawa. Things have come to such a standstill that the only option left is to have an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719092">The Conservatives have been betting on this for weeks now. I regret the fact that we ended up in this position. Unfortunately, I can understand the political motives behind it. The New Democrats decided they did not want to be part of that working relationship anymore after two and a half years of seeing successful things happen. I understand that decisions had to be made for whatever reasons. We can debate whether or not that was right or wrong, but the one thing we cannot debate, because there is no room for discussion in this, is whether or not we were effective for two and a half years and are not effective now, at least during the regular sitting time of this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719093"> I will say that it is really good that a lot of legislation was passed in the spring, legislation that the Senate is still dealing with and has been able to deal with during this time. I just came from a reception across the street put on by folks from the east coast, a shed party over there. I also talked to a senator who said it was a good thing that we did have a lot of legislation. We have been able to work through that and get caught up on a lot of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719094">We are still continuing to deliver. We are still seeing legislation that would otherwise never be implemented if an election was called now, stuff like pharmacare, for example. Although we passed it here, it had to go over to the Senate and do its work there. While in the Senate, it had to go through all the proper stages.</ParaText>

We should be debating housing through government legislation, which the NDP was able to successfully contribute to not that long ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719100">That is what we should be debating. We should not be debating concurrence motions, moving things around, and how we take a committee report and send it back to committee as proposed in the amendment. We should be working on actual government legislation that would have a meaningful, tangible impact on Canadians' lives. A concurrence report coming from committee, although very important in terms of the work that we do here, does not have the ability to direct any kind of legislation other than in terms of asking the government to bring in a new piece of legislation with respect to the issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719109">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> will say that the housing accelerator fund is a program that has never produced any housing. If we go back and look at everything they have said in the House, we see that 19 of the Conservative members at times have been very critical of the program, yet they themselves have written letters to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> asking for money for their communities through the program because, although the Leader of the Opposition sits there and talks about how the fund has never built any housing, they know that the $30 million, the amount that is coming to Kingston, is not meant to physically build houses but instead is there to unlock other housing developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719110">As an example, the City of Kingston has historically, over time, maybe through provincial legislation and maybe through zoning efforts on its own, developed cumbersome processes to develop housing. Maybe the development charges are too high. Maybe permit fees are too high. Maybe there is too much red tape. The federal government says it is going to give the City of Kingston $30 million, and it has to be aimed only at how city officials remove their red tape and how they figure out ways to encourage more housing to be built faster in their city.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719111"> The funniest part about this is that it is something that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> himself was talking about a couple of years ago. At the same time that we introduced the program, before it had been voted on in the budget, he was actually saying that we took his idea. However, the Leader of the Opposition suddenly decided he was going to confuse the issue for Canadians so they do not know what is really going on here; he was just going to say, “The money going to the cities is not building housing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719112"> The money that is going to the cities is intended to encourage them and to find ways to reduce red tape and build faster so we can get more housing built. The federal government fully knows that there is no way we as society and as the government can build the amount of housing that is required, and nor do we want to. The government's job is not to build housing, except in certain circumstances where we are working with organizations, to build affordable housing, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719113">Therefore I find it really rich to hear Conservatives get up and talk about the failure of the government and of the housing accelerator fund, when behind the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s back, 19 Conservative members have been secretly writing letters to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation>, saying that their mayor or their council really needs some of the housing accelerator fund because they know that it is going to help them build faster, that the program is going to work and that their communities need the money too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719114">There is an idea that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> says was his idea. He then starts slamming it as being completely ineffective, once we also agree and bring forward our very similar idea. Then while the Leader of the Opposition is doing that and while they are getting up in the House talking down the housing accelerator fund and saying it is an absolute failure, Conservatives are sending secret letters to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> saying, “Can we please get some of that money, because we know it's effective?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719115">Then the Leader of the Opposition finds out that the letters have been sent and he tells his MPs that they are no longer allowed to send letters to the government asking for help for their communities. Let us just think about that for a moment. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> is no longer allowed to write to the government to ask the government to help his community.</ParaText>

Do they represent their communities or do they represent the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>? I think it is pretty evident from everything that has gone on in the news, the stories we have heard about the Liberal Party and what we talk about in caucus that we can get away with saying a lot. We can vote our conscience and get away with it. That is not the case with the Conservative Party, not when leaks are coming out saying Conservative MPs are concerned that the entire operation of the Conservative Party is whatever the Leader of the Opposition happens to think of on a given day and what slogan he comes up with in the shower on a given morning. He will all of a sudden give the new three-word slogan, and his team will monitor to see how many MPs have been saying it and at what time. They will get gold stars every time they say it. Then whoever gets the most gold stars gets a prize. That is effectively what is happening over there, so there is no representation of their communities.</ParaText>

That is in fact false. In order to demonstrate the point, I wrote a letter to the government while he was speaking.

He said that the program does not build homes; it gives money to municipalities in the hope that they will clean up problems with their permitting process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719132">The Conservatives have a much better solution. First of all, we will make housing more affordable for Canadians by removing the GST from new homes. We will also say to municipalities that they have to meet certain housing targets to receive the same level of federal funding. If they exceed those targets, they will get a bonus, and if they do not meet those targets, they will face a clawback. We would pay for results instead of just giving municipalities money and feeding bureaucracies in the hopes that it is going to change things. Our plan will actually get homes built.</ParaText>

I want to give the hon. member the opportunity to respond because he suggested that, in this current context, it is not the government's role to build housing.

              <ParaText id="8719139">I invite the hon. member to rise. He does not have to cite his party's policy, but perhaps he could envision a bigger, bolder role for the definancialization of housing. In this, the federal government could meet the scale and scope of the crisis, actually go back to its roots and build affordable homes, as they did with the little strawberry box housing they have in both Kingston and Hamilton Centre. I am going to ask him to stand up and just dream a little bit bigger today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719140">Madam Speaker, there is a very important role for the federal government to play in housing. I want to talk specifically about affordable housing. The reality is that, yes, the federal government was involved in building affordable housing back in the 1960s and 1970s. The federal government did that. I think, personally, of all the experience I have had in affordable housing in Kingston. I sat on the affordable housing development committee before I was a city councillor. As a city councillor, I continued to sit on that committee. As mayor, I saw a lot of legacy projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719141">The reality is that the affordable housing that the federal government was involved in building in the 1960s and 1970s, unfortunately, led to stigmatization and the ghettoization of housing. If he wants me to dream bigger, and I will do that with him right now, the proper way to build affordable housing is to build it in a way that integrates it into a community. We should not have 100 affordable units all together. We should have 10 affordable units in 10 different areas of the city, of the community, because that actually allows the affordable units to be integrated throughout the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719142">We decrease the stigmatization, not only of the affordable housing that is being offered but also of those who live in the housing and the way they interact with folks who are not living in affordable housing. In particular, the style of affordable housing that was being offered back in the 1960s and 1970s was stigmatized. There is an incredible amount of work that can be done here, and there is a role for the government to play in this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719150">I was a city councillor, and I know what happened during the 30 years of deferred federal investments in social housing, which is very different from what Liberals like to call affordable housing. The member suggested that social housing, non-market housing, had a stigma. I would put back to him that the people seeking refuge in tents right now, who will be facing the winter months coming up as snow begins to fall, would absolutely love to be in social housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719151">Social housing does not have to be built in the ghettoized style of the 1960s and 1970s.

The British soldiers scrambled to get their gear together and the Canadian soldiers, while waiting, started shooting at the bottles of liquor that were left on the shelf. In horror, my grandfather yelled, “Cease fire, cease fire.” He asked the Canadian soldier, and I am not going to use the exact language he used, what they were doing.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the plight of Armed Forces veterans who experience homelessness. Research has shown that approximately 2,950 veterans are experiencing homelessness, representing 2.2% of the homeless population in Canada. Alcohol and drug addiction are key drivers of veteran homelessness, followed by mental health challenges (including post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), and difficulty transitioning to civilian life.</QuotePara>

The Liberals' excuse for ignoring Veterans concerns is that this is an issue which could be examined in perpetuity as the evolving nature of the modern world and workforce will undoubtedly continue to present new challenges to Veterans in transition. Therefore, the Liberal Government and their NDP and Bloc partners have attempted to absolve themselves of any responsibility to Veterans, but Conservatives wholeheartedly reject that Liberal premise and table this dissenting report to be a voice....</QuotePara>

My family came here with a dream to own property, and struggled under a previous Liberal government in the 1970s when another prime minister with the same last name was in charge. Things have not gotten better. We need to do better for the people of this country and for veterans.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8719175"> Madam Speaker, I apologize to my children for abruptly hanging up on them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719176">I am pleased to be back in the House to be able to speak about this important report on homelessness. I will start by following up on comments made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>, who actually admitted what the government's so-called housing accelerator program does. He admitted it does not build homes. Let us be clear, this is not just something we say to criticize the program. This is what the government acknowledges about its housing accelerator program, that it does not have as its purpose the construction of homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719177">The government's approach is, in some sense, to recognize, as the member said, that there are some significant problems with red tape and the cost of government at various levels limiting housing construction. However, its solution is to pile more money into those same bureaucratic processes and to think that is going to make the system better. The member identified in his speech a problem we have been talking about for a long time in the official opposition, which is that the cost of government, red tape and gatekeepers are slowing down and limiting the construction of new homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719178">The member's solution is, effectively, to say to those gatekeepers, “We are going to give you more steel and more poles so you can build more and higher gates.” The response should instead be, in order to provide relief to Canadians who are trying to buy homes, to lower their taxes, which would make it easier for Canadians to buy homes. The government should also say to municipalities that it is not going to pump more dollars into ineffective bureaucracies, that it is going to expect results in terms of housing construction and that municipalities have to meet targets for new home construction. It should say that if municipalities meet those targets, they will be able to continue to receive transfers from the federal government, and actually receive a bonus if they exceed that target, but that there will be a clawback, a fiscal implication, if they fail to meet those targets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719179">Instead of simply giving more money to bureaucracies that the government has just acknowledged have some problems, our approach will be to say to those same bureaucracies that we expect results, and we want to incentivize results by tying federal transfers to results in terms of new housing construction. It reflects a fundamentally different attitude toward policy-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719180">In the official opposition, we care about results. We think the measure of the effectiveness of a housing policy is whether people are housed. The government seems to think the measure of an effective housing policy is not the results but the intention demonstrated by the expenditure. We care about the results. The government wants its activities to be assessed on the basis of its intentions and measured by its expenditures. It creates a program, says it has a good intention and is going to put money behind it, even though it does not actually get homes built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719181">In the official opposition, we say we are going to take all that money the government is feeding into already bloated bureaucracies and use those resources to take the GST off new homes for Canadians. We are going to lower the taxes Canadians pay, we are going to give that money directly to Canadians instead of putting it into bureaucracies and we are also going to say to municipalities that they have to achieve certain results in terms of new home construction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719182">That is clearly a much better, much more effective approach. We are focused on incentivizing and pushing those results. If municipalities do not produce those results, they are going to face a clawback of federal transfers. Meanwhile, it also reflects a belief that giving Canadians back more of their hard-earned money rather than transferring more money into municipal bureaucracies is the solution, giving Canadians the ability to afford their homes. We have a clear plan. It is to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Of course, tonight we are talking about building the homes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719183"> The Liberals always act as if those lines are a trigger for them. The member for Mississauga seems to be triggered by these lines: axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Colleagues can see that we have clear, robust plans behind each of those identified priorities. They reflect a commitment to Canadians to actually deliver results. They are not just to talk about things or to have good intentions, backed up by taxpayer-funded expenditures. Our proposals are to achieve concrete results. We will axe the tax. We will build the homes. We will fix the budget. We will stop the crime. We will ask Canadians to measure our government, not by good intention and by expenditure, but by the actual results that are achieved. I invite the contrast that the member has proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719184">We are confident that giving money to Canadians and incentivizing real results from bureaucracies is the way to achieve results, not to pile more money into bureaucracies and expect somehow that the results are going to change simply by increasing the volume of expenditure on exactly the same things. If we look at the results of the last nine years, we are clearly much worse off. Canadians are paying twice as much for their housing. They are paying twice as much for rent. There has been a dramatic increase in violent crime. The Prime Minister, with the current <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation>, who is the former immigration minister, gravely mismanaged the immigration system. The minister who broke immigration was transferred over to housing because the government thought he could be a communicator for them on that file, but he has failed to deliver results in housing just as he failed to deliver results when it came to immigration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719185"> The parliamentary secretary, as well, has talked about how for the last two years we were getting things done. He said we were effective in the sense that we were putting forward ideas and passing them. I do not think Canadians would say the government was effective. It has effectively been moving the country in the wrong direction. It has effectively made housing costs higher, made rents higher and increased the crime rate. This was the result of the NDP-Liberal coalition. We had a photo op of the NDP <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> saying he was tearing up the coalition agreement. Then he taped it back together and has supported the government at every turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719186"> It will be Canadians who judge the plans that are put in front of them. I am looking forward to the chance to make our case to Canadians, to make the case in favour of our plan to axe the tax, build the homes, as we are particularly talking about tonight, as well as fix the budget and stop the crime. However, the NDP has continued to prop up the Liberals for a variety of reasons. I would challenge New Democrats to have the courage of their convictions, if they are their convictions. If they really think that piling more dollars into existing bureaucracies is the way to build homes, despite this not working for the last nine years, they should bring that case to the Canadian people and see what Canadians decide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719187">We will be coming forward with our plan to incentivize real results from bureaucracies and to deliver real tax relief for Canadians. We will be bringing our plan to Canadians; the Liberals will be bringing theirs. That will happen when the carbon tax election eventually comes. The Liberals should have the courage of their convictions. They should see the demand from Canadians for change and they should put their proposal before the Canadian people. They are unwilling to do that, though. They talk a good game about how they are apparently confident about what they are doing, but they are unwilling to bring their proposal to the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719188">Let us have a carbon tax election. Let us have that election now. Let us see what Canadians think about what the government is doing. I am proud to stack our plan to build the homes against their nine years of failures any day.</ParaText>

It is not just money that is being given to bloat bureaucracy, as this member suggests. It is actual money that is tied to creating more housing, and the municipalities have to prove that they have been able to increase the housing. That is not just our idea. The quote that I just read, supporting this exact concept, was from June 7, 2023, from the Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, for the member to be critical of the housing accelerator fund is to be critical of the proposal that was made by his own leader.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719198">The Liberals have had nine years. They have objectively failed to build homes. We are not building homes at nearly the rate we need to. Housing costs are up dramatically for all Canadians. It has been nine years of failure under the government, and its members believe that announcing additional funding for existing bureaucracies is going to change that. Canadians, again, are not going to judge the current government by its intentions or its expenditures. They are going to judge it by the results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719199">Meanwhile, Conservatives have a record in government of much better performance when it comes to actual housing affordability for Canadians, and we are putting forward specific proposals that would cut taxes for Canadians, incentivize the construction of new homes and achieve results. Certainly, Canadians will judge the results, just as they will judge the current government by the results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719200">However, eliminating the GST on new homes would provide a significant benefit for Canadians. It would increase home construction. It would help to achieve the results that the current government has failed to achieve for nine years. Essentially, I think what we are hearing from the parliamentary secretary is a partial admission of failure up to this point, but he is saying that now they are suddenly going to change things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719201">It has not worked. With nine years of failure, we are worse off. We need a new government, and we need a common-sense carbon tax election so Canadians can decide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719208">Madam Speaker, I always find it interesting to be in the House and to listen to the Conservatives and the Liberals fight about who did housing worse. As the NDP, we can tell them that they both did it terribly. Both governments decided they were going to walk away from their responsibility to offer safe, human-right housing in Canada and give it to the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719209"> Now the Liberals and Conservatives are seeing the fruits of their misguided decisions in the fact that people in my community and other communities across this country are living rough in tents, in parks, on benches and in their cars. Meanwhile, right beside them are 20-, 30-, 40- and 50-storey luxury towers. We only have to go to Vancouver and see the chandelier that is hanging under a bridge as public art steps away from Canadians who are living in tents. They cannot afford to get into these luxury towers and they are having their housing removed. I would ask the Conservatives and the Liberals, as they come to what the Liberals called a meaningless debate today, to think about what they have done and how it has manifested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719210">I want to say a big thanks and really recognize the member for <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, my colleague in the NDP, who was years ahead on the issue of the financialization of housing and the role and impact it was having on people. I say to the member from the Liberal side that the amendment of adding impact is important because there has been an impact. We can think about this study and about what my colleague the member for Vancouver East saw in her community in Vancouver, people becoming homeless and more and more people finding housing out of reach while luxury condo after luxury condo was being built. I saw the same thing in my community of Port Moody—Coquitlam, where purpose-built affordable rental units were bought up by wealthy developers and financialization landlords to create more housing that the people they were displacing could not afford to get into. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719211">I think about when one of the very first luxury condo projects got approved in my riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam, back in 2014 and 2015, and the developer came and said they were going to do rental housing beside it. They were going to do two towers and do rental housing. Back in 2014 and 2015, we thought that would be great. What they did build was a luxury building. It was a luxury rental building not accessible for the people they had displaced when they bought up the old affordable purpose-built rental housing and built their two luxury towers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719212">I want the current government members to know that their decisions, and the decisions of the Conservatives before them, have made people homeless. It is not just me saying this. The federal housing advocate said the aim of these people, these corporations, involved in the financialization of housing is to maximize their profit by increasing rent and cutting services for tenants. They are doing it on purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719213">I will go back to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, who put a dissenting report together for this financialization of housing report to say that the government needs to stop this loss of affordable purpose-built rental housing and to start protecting these buildings. I want to give credit to the B.C. NDP government, David Eby and the housing minister Ravi Kahlon. They immediately put forward a $500-million fund to protect affordable purpose-built rental housing in our communities across B.C. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719214">What did the federal government do? It did nothing. It was asked over and over again to protect affordable rental housing and the government members let it ride with the market. It is totally unacceptable and it is why we are in this position we are in today. The government is missing in relation to protecting affordable housing and creating affordable housing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719215">Do members know why? It is because the Liberals are propping up these landlords. These financialized corporate landlords are their donors. They are their friends. They know them personally. They are protecting them in committee. In fact, as the NDP, when I asked for one of these financialized landlords to come to committee and talk about what it does with respect to its housing, the Liberal parliamentary secretary for housing protected it and voted against having it come in. It was the same with the Conservatives. We have not heard from these landlords that are financializing housing because they have been protected by the Conservatives and the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719216">I will add that Starlight Investments, one of these financialized landlords, was invited twice to committee to testify and twice it refused. Instead of the Liberal government saying that was not acceptable as it is accountable to Canadians, it said it was fine. In fact, during the summer, the chair of that committee said that it was fine and he would let it send in a written response. No. It needs to come to committee, talk about its business practices and what it is doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719217">I also want it to talk about its partnerships with the federal government because it has connections to these financialized landlords through asset management. The financialization of housing is not just happening out there in the market with these landlords; it is happening right inside our pension funds with choices being made by the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719218">Therefore, there is a lot of work to do here. Who is suffering? The most vulnerable people in Canada. I want to talk about seniors. Seniors are some of the longest-holding purpose-built rental tenants. For 10, 15, 20 even 25 years they have been in those apartments. They are the ones who are being targeted by these landlords who want to financialize. They want to get them out so they can jack up those rents. It is absolutely disgraceful. In B.C., for the first time ever, people over 55 are finding themselves homeless. This is absolutely unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719219">I go back to the Liberal member who made a speech earlier and said that this debate is meaningless and does not do anything. That is their choice. The Liberals have decided to do nothing, to let seniors, persons with disabilities, single moms and immigrants to this country become homeless. The Liberal government is involved in that decision to let financialized landlords kick them out of their homes. There was recently some research on this that came through the CBC. There is some very strong research that proves that these financialized landlords raise rents through these above-guideline rent increases more than any other type of landlord. Not just that, they evict at a higher rate. Where is the federal government to stop this exploitation and the pushing of people out onto the streets? It is nowhere. It does not even want to have a discussion about it at committee. It is protecting its financialization landlords. It is not taking this crisis seriously. I ask the government this. How many more seniors, persons with disabilities, single mothers and indigenous women having to give up their kids because the shelter does not allow them to bring their kids with them—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8719226">Madam Speaker, I said a few weeks ago that the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal was the biggest scandal we have seen yet, and I think Canadians saw why today. A senior Liberal cabinet minister from Alberta with multiple different areas of responsibility, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, left cabinet because of the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal. Now members across the way think this is funny. It is not funny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719227">The Assembly of First Nations has told committee that a majority of the contracts that are supposed to be going to indigenous entrepreneurs, supporting economic development in indigenous communities, are going to shell companies. Indigenous leaders have been repeatedly testifying at committee that there is rampant abuse in a program that is supposed to benefit indigenous entrepreneurs and communities. People are pretending to be indigenous. There are shell companies and there are abuses of joint ventures, where virtually all of the benefit goes to a non-indigenous company. This is the abuse that has been happening, and we have been talking about it for months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719228">However, it has just recently come out that a company owned by the former minister of employment, who just resigned, was pretending to be indigenous in order to try to get government contracts. Therefore not only is there rampant abuse of the program by people who are not indigenous but are pretending to be indigenous or trying to take advantage of the program in other ways, but also there is a former member of the Liberal caucus who owns a company that pretended to be indigenous-owned when it was owned by a minister of the Crown who is not Indigenous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719229">The former minister repeatedly misrepresented himself. The Liberal Party, in its public statements, identified him as indigenous and said that he was part of the Liberal's indigenous caucus. Every other member of the caucus still identifies as indigenous, but he acknowledges that he is not, even though he was a member of it. In various situations, he falsely represented himself as being indigenous; this was part of a political story he wanted to tell, but it was also the basis on which the company he owned pretended to be an indigenous-owned company and tried to get contracts on that basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719230">The former minister's company is not the only instance of abuse. Again, the AFN is saying that it happens with the majority of companies getting the contracts. There are companies like Dalian Enterprise and a Canadian health care agency, which got over $100 million each and where there were very clearly abuses of joint ventures. These are companies that were taken off the indigenous business list but nonetheless profited significantly while they were on it. This is absolutely disgusting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719231"> Indigenous peoples in this country are experiencing unacceptable levels of poverty. The government came in with high words about reconciliation, yet here we are today. The Liberals came in promising reconciliation, and nine years later a minister of the government is leaving cabinet because he pretended to be indigenous and used that pretense to try to advance the commercial interests of his own private company by getting contracts from the government. The government defended him for far too long. He remains a member of the government caucus, and his company remains eligible for government contracts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719235">I thank the member for this opportunity to talk about the importance of economic reconciliation through supporting indigenous businesses. I think it is important to take a step back to remind members why the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses was created in the first place. Indigenous people in Canada comprise approximately 5% of the overall population, yet, historically, businesses owned by first nations, Inuit and Métis entrepreneurs were consistently winning a lower percentage of federal contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719236">In the early 1990s, the government saw an opportunity to facilitate indigenous people's access to procurement opportunities. In 1995, the eligibility criteria for the current procurement strategy for indigenous businesses, PSIB, then under a slightly different name, was approved. Based on engagements with indigenous organizations and business leaders, in 2021, Public Services and Procurement Canada, in collaboration with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and Indigenous Services Canada, created more opportunities by implementing the mandatory minimum 5% indigenous procurement target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719237">Today, the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses and the mandatory 5% target continue to be two important ways the Government of Canada supports indigenous businesses, including indigenous entrepreneurs, across the country. We have heard many times from indigenous partners how important this PSIB is for advancing economic reconciliation and supporting indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719238">Since we announced the 5% target, we have seen a surge in indigenous entrepreneurs' interest and investment in the program. In contrast, the proportion of contracts going to indigenous businesses in the Harper years never went above 1%. Now, Conservatives are trying to undermine this critical program by focusing on the extremely rare instances of bad actors that do not represent the overall merit of the procurement strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719239">Investing in indigenous communities and building up indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs benefits all Canadians. According to the 2022 national indigenous economic strategy for Canada, the continued exclusion of indigenous people costs the Canadian economy $27.7 billion every year. The National Indigenous Economic Development Board found that closing the existing employment gap could help lift over 150,000 indigenous people out of poverty. There is a real cost to inaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719240">I would like to be clear: we are working closely with indigenous partners to improve the indigenous procurement process and address these concerns. Together with indigenous partners, we are gathering information and building the foundation for a co-developed, transformative, indigenous procurement strategy that supports economic reconciliation. One of the components of this co-developed strategy is the transfer of the indigenous business directory to indigenous partners. We know that first nations, Inuit and Métis are best positioned to define and verify indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719241">We will continue to work with indigenous partners to co-develop a path forward that strengthens economic relationships with indigenous entrepreneurs and businesses. These increased economic opportunities for first nations, Inuit and Métis people are vital to ensuring continued growth and prosperity for all of Canada. We will continue to improve and support the program as it is vital for supporting indigenous businesses and communities. I hope that our Conservative colleagues will support us in doing that.</ParaText>

The member did not at all mention the fact that today, a minister of the Crown left cabinet because his company was trying to abuse this program. She said, “extremely rare instances of bad actors”. That is completely the opposite of what we were told by the Assembly of First Nations and by many other indigenous leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719243">The government is not listening. Indigenous leaders are telling us that abuses are rampant in this program, that there are companies that have received hundreds of millions of dollars through abuses. They are not indigenous but they are benefiting from this. We have a member of the Liberal caucus who is a bad actor in this whole process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719244">Again, will the government show some humility and stop pretending everything is fine, listen to indigenous leaders and actually recognize that there is a big problem?</ParaText>

If a department or agency has concerns about supplier integrity or misconduct at any point in a procurement process, they can refer the matter to Public Services and Procurement Canada's office of supplier integrity and compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719246">The office administers the strengthened ineligibility and suspension policy, which came into effect earlier this year. This policy sets out the circumstances and processes that enable the registrar of ineligibility and suspension to suspend and de-buy our suppliers. This includes suppliers who have been charged with or convicted of a specific offence or have been found to lack business integrity or business honesty in a manner that directly affects their present responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719247">On this side of the House, we will continue to improve and support the indigenous procurement process in true partnership.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719248">Madam Speaker, we are back this evening to debate a question that I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, a question that arose from constant media coverage and from a parliamentary intelligence committee report that provided insight on the infamous 11 parliamentarians who were in the pocket of the Chinese Communist Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719249">I asked the Prime Minister if he had trouble sitting at the cabinet table, as he must have wittingly known that at least one of his ministers may not have been working in the service of Canada. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew he could not defend the indefensible, so instead of answering the question, he attacked my question by theatrically stating that I was displaying “irreverence and unseriousness in a place that deserves a serious contemplation of issues of national security”. What is disgraceful, very serious and irresponsible is the continuous refusal of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to name those individuals and provide information that he sat on for several months to the appropriate authorities so that a badly needed investigation can be launched, charges can be laid and our courts can determine the guilt or innocence of those who remain kept in seclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719250">It is obvious that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is in denial or completely unaware that he is not above the law. Moreover, he is equally clued out in understanding that nowhere is it written that a prime minister has the power to obstruct justice and override the Criminal Code of Canada. It is unconscionable that the Prime Minister has ignored all efforts for these 11 individuals to be identified and for the laws of Canada to be applied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719251">The Criminal Code is clear on the issue of treason, and unlike the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, most Canadians believe that the Criminal Code is the law of the land and that laws are there to protect Canadians, not to protect Liberals or anyone else who sells out their country for political or financial gain. The code is not some plaything of a prime minister. It is incumbent on a prime minister to act to protect Canadians and our democracy from those who are out to subvert our institutions. That is the duty of a prime minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719252">I find it passing strange that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is concerned about the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">opposition leader</Affiliation>'s security clearance when the Prime Minister is shielding the investigation and prosecution of those who are in league with agents of foreign interference, including at least one cabinet minister. As long as those 11 traitors remain unnamed and uninvestigated, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is in fact abetting foreign interference and protecting those in the pocket of Beijing. Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719253">There is no defending the indefensible. No matter what is in the <Affiliation DbId="311628" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>'s talking points, for the leader of the Liberal Party to cover for 11 traitors who are in the pocket of the Chinese Communist Party and who are escaping justice is an affront to Parliament and to all Canadians. Those 11 individuals remain in the protected custody of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who, by his own actions, is in contempt of our laws and of the administration of justice. What is the Prime Minister so afraid of? Is the Prime Minister afraid to release the 11 names because of who they are or the roles they hold in the government, in his own caucus or in the Liberal Party?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719255">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to the paramount issue of combatting foreign interference in our democratic institutions. I certainly take this matter very seriously. I have respect for the House, and I wish the member would demonstrate the same. The allegations referenced here are misleading and defamatory, and he is simply peddling misinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719256">On this side of the House, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and ministers of the Crown have security clearances and have been vetted by national security. That is more than I can say for the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, who the member opposite is sitting closer and closer to. That is why I would like to turn my attention to what matters, which is what the government is doing on foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719257">In September 2023, the government announced the establishment of the public inquiry into foreign interference in federal processes and democratic processes following extensive consultations with all recognized parties in the House of Commons. All parties agreed to the terms of reference and the appointment of the commissioner, Justice Marie-Josée Hogue, a judge of the Court of Appeal of Quebec. The commissioner is mandated to examine and assess interference from China, Russia and other foreign state or non-state actors, including any potential impacts, to confirm the integrity of and any impacts on the 2019 and 2021 federal general elections at the national and electoral district levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719258">As members of the House know, the commissioner's interim report was delivered on May 3, 2024. Some of the key findings from this initial report were that foreign interference did not affect the overall outcomes of the 2019 and 2021 elections, and the administration of these elections were sound. Foreign interference did not undermine the integrity of Canada's electoral system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719259">The commission's initial report did not make any recommendations for the government or other stakeholders. These will be included in the commission's final report. The government looks forward to reviewing the final report and any recommendations the commissioner may have for better protecting federal democratic processes from foreign interference. These will help inform future measures. In the meantime, the government continues its work to counter the evolving threat of foreign interference in Canada's democratic institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719260">Since the commissioner was appointed, the government has taken a number of steps. In September 2023, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a statement in the House of Commons that there were credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen in British Columbia. In October 2023, the government issued a second public statement on a probable Chinese government's “spamouflage” disinformation campaign targeting dozens of Canadian parliamentarians and issued letters to those parliamentarians who were targeted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719261">In December 2023, Canada joined the United Kingdom's attribution of malicious cyber activity in Russia that targeted U.K. politics and democratic processes. In January 2024, early preparations for the critical election incident public protocol panel began with individual briefings to panel members. Also in January 2024, the government published and shared a tool kit to resist disinformation and foreign interference and “Countering Disinformation: A Guidebook for Public Servants”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719262">In March 2024, the government introduced Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document> which proposes amendments to the Canada Elections Act, including measures to further strengthen federal electoral processes against foreign interference. This bill has passed second reading in the House and is currently being studied in committee. In June 2024, unclassified briefings on foreign interference were provided to members of Parliament. On June 20, 2024, Bill <Document DbId="13064389" Type="3">C-70</Document>, the Countering Foreign Interference Act, received royal assent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719263">The Government of Canada has taken a range of measures to address the evolving threat of foreign interference in Canada's democratic processes. We look forward to reviewing any recommendations that Commissioner Hogue may have in her final report.
