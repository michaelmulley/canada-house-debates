              <ParaText id="8760900">Mr. Speaker, I will start today by thanking my friend, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278222" Type="2">Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner</Affiliation>, because it is rare that an S. O. 31 so hits home that I decide I had better put it on my social media page. The hon. member's S. O. 31 dealt with one theme, and that was kindness, how we can be kinder to each other. In the last week, we have seen some moments that we regret, some moments where things are sad. Postures are taken that suggest to Canadians we are not people worth emulating, those they elect to represent them in this place. What would affect us more, to think our mothers are watching or to know our children are watching?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760901">Words not said often enough in this place are “I was wrong” and “I am sorry.” My hon. friend, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278358" Type="2">Grande Prairie—Mackenzie</Affiliation>, brought me up short by telling me about some words I had carelessly said in the media. I completely agree with what the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> said in her point of order, but I also told the same reporter I had agreed with what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278460" Type="2">Calgary Rocky Ridge</Affiliation> had said. However, it never gets reported exactly the way we say it, and I should know better. </ParaText>

Folks from around the globe gathered in Regina to take in the world-class livestock shows, the trade shows and the rodeo. This year featured 130 major events, including four nights of rodeo, the indigenous agriculture summit, the Canadian animal agtech awards and the 25th year of the RBC beef supreme champions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760908">Agribition holds a special place in my heart because my family showed Holsteins there for 25 straight years. It is my family's winter holiday. The barns are where I learned many life lessons, some the hard way, and made many lifelong friends. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8760912">The Conservatives pretend they want lower taxes, but when push comes to shove, they vote against tax exemptions for Canadians. They want family essentials, such as car seats, diapers and children's toys, to be more expensive. We can talk about a heart that is two sizes too small. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760913">We will not listen to these Grinches. Starting December 14, these items will be tax-free, and Canadians will be able to keep more of their money in their pockets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8760915">The bronze monument <I>Presence in Absence</I> is meant to honour 67 servicemen and women for making the ultimate sacrifice. What a shock it was for the two women veterans when they found their own names on it. However, this was not the only error. Of the 67 soldiers listed, only 20 made the ultimate sacrifice. Twelve are still alive, and four have never worn the uniform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760916">No one noticed the mistake before the monument was unveiled in 2022. Neither the soldiers who are still alive nor their families were invited to the unveiling. What an appalling lack of respect. The minister owes veterans an explanation and, above all, an apology. After this fiasco and the Afghanistan memorial debacle, it is clear that Ottawa is a monument to incompetence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8760917"> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, December 3, was the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. People with disabilities are the largest minority group within Canada and worldwide, as well as the only minority group that anyone can become a member of at any time. People in this group face stigma, discrimination and barriers to basic rights and services. They are more likely to experience poverty and face disproportionate impacts from climate disasters, conflicts and an increasing cost of living. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760918">It is important for the voices of people with disabilities to be included in all conversations. More than one in four Canadians have one or more disabilities, with mental health-related disabilities being the most prominent among youth. Our government has been working to support Canadians with disabilities through the development of a Canada disability benefit, the autism national framework and funding for mental health service delivery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760919">I am grateful to community groups in my riding, such as CMHA York Simcoe, Community Living Central York, the Lighthouse Learning and Development Centre, Kerry's Place and Child Disability Network Canada, which advocate for and work to support people living with disabilities. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8760922">Grief does not change us; it reveals us. We become someone it would have been impossible to be before. In this way, our loved one lives on in us. Everyone loves and everyone has loss. Grief is universal, a sacred process, yet it is so unique. We all cope differently. We do not get over the loss of a loved one but learn to courageously adapt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760923">This is my first Christmas without my dad. I know he would want us to make turtles, sing <I>Silent Night</I>, put the lights up outside and decorate the tree with ornaments that represent our collective memories, losses, prayers, hopes and holiday wishes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760924">This Christmas season, we should reach out to those who need a hug and let them know we care. We should speak the names of those we have lost and know that their memories will never fade away as long as we refuse to let them. Grief is not a sign of weakness or a lack of faith. It is the price of love. </ParaText>

Anyone can see that this is a failed policy, even the Ontario Liberal leader, Bonnie Crombie. In a speech last night, she said, “I'm not here to tell the prime minister how to do his job. But, I promise you, I will tell him when he is wrong. Like on the carbon tax”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8760933">I completely agree. It is wrong for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to punish Canadians with this heartless carbon tax, which devalues workers' paycheques. It is wrong to drive up the cost of living and vandalize our economy. Crombie's statement is not only a political critique but also a recognition that everyday Canadians struggle in so many ways. People should not have to choose between feeding their families and heating their homes this winter, yet the NDP-Liberal government will hike the carbon tax again in the new year. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761209">It is with great sadness, though, that I have to rise in the House today to speak to the report from the health committee related to breast cancer screening guidelines in Canada. One of the things that we do know is that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetimes, which is not an insignificant statistic. Even more poignant is that one in 36 are expected to die from the illness. When we look at these numbers, we know that this is something that, as we look around the chamber, could certainly affect many of us who are here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761210">From a very personal perspective, I want to say that my own wife, Deborah, had breast cancer and now, as of this spring, will be an eight-year survivor. Again, not to be overly personal, but when somebody realizes they have cancer, either by screening mammography or because they have found a lump in their breast, as a spouse who has experienced it and as a former physician who has seen this happen many times, the whole world comes to a screeching halt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761211">The most difficult thing, of course, is not knowing what is next, not knowing how severe the illness is and not knowing exactly what the treatment is going to look like, how they are going to feel, how long it is going to last or how terribly it is going to affect them, their family and those who are there to support them. Sadly, it also presents a significant financial burden often for Canadians who live in rural communities and have to go back and forth to appointments in larger centres at their own expense. That is not an insignificant thought either. Taking time off from work further exacerbates that difficulty. Certainly, I am thankful every day that my wife has made the incredible recovery that she has. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761212">From a statistical perspective, breast cancer is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadians aged 30 to 49, which really brings us to look at why it is so important that the current guidelines, which suggest that Canadian women should begin screening for breast cancer via mammography at age 50, should be reduced and screening offered to women at the age of 40. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761213">It really does pain me to think that this is a political issue. The difficulty is that those who bring forward the science around this, sadly, are not being listened to. It is the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care that puts forward these guidelines. It does not mean that the guidelines are binding to physicians, but certainly many jurisdictions would use those recommendations from the Canadian task force to inform decisions related to offering mammography to women earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761214"> Part of the discussion is absolutely abhorrent when we begin to consider it. Some of the testimony that we heard was that screening women earlier would lead to finding things that would have to be investigated and, in the end, would turn out not to be cancerous, and of course that creates some anxiety. There were actually witnesses who suggested that the anxiety would be overwhelming. From the perspective of someone who has gone through it in a few different ways, it would be much more anxiety producing to miss something and know that someone had a much further-advanced cancer than they would have if it had been caught earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761215">As we look at some of the statistics around this, there was a study published that looked at this particular issue and said Canadian women 40 to 49 years old were diagnosed with significantly fewer stage 1 and more stage 2 and stage 3 breast cancers than women aged 50 to 59. That means that, because younger women were not being offered screening mammography, their cancers were diagnosed at a much more advanced stage. As many people here in the House and watching on TV would know, when cancers are diagnosed at a later stage, the person is given a much worse prognosis or outcome and that is certainly something that we want to avoid in cancers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761216">Those cancers that are diagnosed at an earlier stage are more easily treatable, and the outcomes are significantly more favourable. We also know that the five-year survival rate is 74% for stage 3 breast cancer and only 23.2% for women who have stage 4 cancer. That is just to support the notion that the earlier the stage at which breast cancer and other cancers are found, the more favourable the outcomes are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761217">It is also interesting, when we begin to look at this, that this same study we are talking about found that earlier screening led to significantly improved survival rates among women in their forties with breast cancer who lived in provinces where they were allowed to receive screening in their forties. Once again, we see this new evidence that is out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761218"> Part of the difficulty with the task force is that it only wants to accept randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials. What does all of that scientific gobbledygook mean? That means that one group would have a treatment and the other group would have a sham treatment, and then we would compare the outcomes without either group knowing which one they were in. That would be unethical to do, because we know at the current time that screening for breast cancer is a proven treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761219"> What we need to understand now is that the outdated information, often from the 1960s, does not necessarily apply to the significant advancements in imaging that we now have in the 2020s. Because that new information is not being included in the decision-making process, what we are finding is that the folks on the preventive task force do not want to change the guidelines in spite of the fact that there is overwhelming evidence to do the contrary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761220"> I think it also important to outline to Canadians that this is about women in the 40- to 49-year age category, and there is also an interesting scientific notion of “potential years of life lost”. For instance, if a 45-year-old woman dies at age 45 and would have lived to 85, that is 40 years of potential years of life lost. We also know that many women are, as is anybody in society at age 40 to 49, in the heyday of their working careers. They are wives. They are mothers. They are sisters. They are daughters. They are aunts. As we look at that significant portion of the life that is lost, we know that in Canada things can be better than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761221">Dr. Paula Gordon, a clinical professor at UBC, informed members of the health committee in June of this year that “women aged 40 to 49 are 44% less likely to die of breast cancer if they have mammograms.” We also heard that breast cancer in younger women is often “more aggressive” than that in older women and spreads faster if left untreated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761222">There are a couple of other notions that need to be brought forward here. It has also been reported that the peak incidence of breast cancer for Black and Asian women is 10 years earlier than among white women, and racialized minorities are particularly harmed by the current outdated guidelines. We also know that, in the United States, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended last year that women begin receiving mammograms of a screening nature at age 40. Why we continue to use these outdated guidelines is very nonsensical. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761223">There are about 470 women aged 40 to 49 who die of breast cancer each year. I think of how many lives we could save by changing these guidelines. I think that, on behalf of all Canadians, when new science becomes available, it is important that it gets called out, and we say that things need to change and they need to change rapidly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761224">On behalf of all Canadians, I would certainly say very strongly to the preventive task force that its guidelines need to change and they need to change quickly, because truly, in this instance, lives are at stake.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761230">That being said, as we look at the evidence, one of the studies we talked about specifically was a 2022 study published in <I>Current Oncology</I>, which states that the current Canadian breast cancer screening guidelines, initially published in 2011 by the Canadian task force, pose a dangerous threat to Canadian women's health. It goes on to say the screening guidelines are based on ancient data, from as early as the 1960s, that provided the recommendation that screening for an average-risk woman begin at age 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761231">It is incredibly important that when new evidence becomes available, it is adopted as quickly as possible. Even these task force recommendations are from 2011. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761232"> I think it is sad we have to have political intervention in a scientific area of expertise because those scientists refuse to be different and do the job they are asked to do on behalf of Canadians. When we know lives are at stake, it is incredibly important that things change today, not tomorrow.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761256">Mr. Speaker, the following reflects a consolidated response approved on behalf of Global Affairs Canada ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761257">With regard to part (a), as of October 7, 2024, Global Affairs Canada is aware of 13 Canadians in custody in Hong Kong. This data was extracted from Global Affairs Canada's consular case management system and may be updated on a daily basis. As such, caution should be exercised when analyzing data in relation to previously disclosed data. These are cases of Canadians detained abroad with a specific detention status: "in detention" or "in a medical facility".</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761258">It should be noted that Canadians may choose not to advise Global Affairs Canada of a situation of detention; moreover, in countries where dual citizenship is not recognized, dual Canadians who entered on non-Canadian documentation would not necessarily result in a detention notification from the host government. It is important, therefore, to underline that these numbers may not represent a complete picture when it comes to detention figures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761259">With regard to part (b), the Government of Canada’s first priority is always the safety and security of its citizens. For this reason, in addition to privacy considerations, we will not comment on or release any information on specific cases. Doing so may compromise ongoing efforts or endanger the safety of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761261">Mr. Speaker,  the Access to Information Act  requires that the package of briefing materials prepared for a minister or deputy head for the purpose of an appearance before a committee of Parliament be proactively published within 120 days after the appearance. The act does not make any distinction regarding the type or format of the information that comprises the package of briefing materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761262">Ministers and deputy heads receive information from departments on a regular basis that may be used for a variety of purposes. This material would not be subject to proactive disclosure requirements 74(d) and 88(c) of the act unless it was part of the package of briefing materials prepared specifically for a parliamentary appearance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761263">Information published through proactive publication should mirror what would be released if information were released in response to an access to information request. In other words, if an institution received a request for the briefing materials prepared for a minister or deputy head for a parliamentary committee appearance, that institution would apply exemptions and exclusions in accordance with the act. The same exemptions and exclusions should apply when briefing materials are proactively published.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761306">What we are discussing, as my colleague and friend from <Affiliation DbId="278126" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester</Affiliation> talked about, is the 20th report from the health committee, or HESA. To give a bit of background for folks watching at home, the report, “Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines“, reads:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the committee report to the House that the decision by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care should be immediately reversed and breast cancer screening should be extended to women in their 40s, as this will help save lives; that the Minister of Health urge the task force to go back to the drawing board and revisit the guidelines based on the latest science; and that the Public Health Agency of Canada table to this committee the parameters given to the task force to update breast cancer screening guidelines.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761308">A lot of women watching, a lot of families watching, have been impacted by breast cancer, and this was a very important study brought forward in the health committee. I had the privilege to sit on the status of women committee, where we also brought this forward. For context, so folks will know, under the Liberal government there is the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and then there is the Public Health Agency, which designated a task force, and a chair of that task force, to study breast cancer. However, what the chair and the task force came back with was a recommendation that there should not be screening for women under the age of 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761309"> Now, as members just heard, this had unanimous consent, and it certainly did in the status of women committee, across all party lines, but this is a terrible recommendation from the task force and the chair. It was interesting to listen to witness after witness in the status of women committee testify against the recommendation of the task force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761310">Here is the thing. I would post these stories and get feedback, I love to hear what people say, and most provinces have already said screening should happen at 40, or self-screening. Those are the provincial rules. However, we have a federal task force, sort of a bureaucratic body, saying no, it should be from 50 and over, which is really bizarre. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761311"> I asked this question to a lot of the witnesses: “Why does it matter? If the task force and the chair are saying it should be over 50, but the provinces already have it at 40 for self-referral, which is the recommendation of the provinces, what does it matter what the task force and its chair says?” Every single witness said, “Because it sends a message that you should not get screened under 50, and that is wrong.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761312"> I want to bring members up to speed a little, because the chair of the task force actually wrote an editorial during our study in the status of women committee, doubling down after hearing witness after witness in the committee saying no. I heard the member from the NDP even agree with this. I think everybody at home knows there are not many things we agree on in this House when we go across the floor, but this is women's health. Women are dying because they are not getting screened in time or it is not being detected that they have breast cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761313">However, the chair, Dr. Guylène Thériault, wrote this article while we were hearing testimony from every single witness to change the age of screening. She said, “the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care...conducted a comprehensive review of evidence on breast cancer screening.... The key message is that breast cancer screening is a personal choice, and that women need the full picture so that they can decide what is right for them.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761314"> That makes sense. We should not have to fight and beg our doctor. We should be able to advocate for what we want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761315">She went on to say, “The evidence did not show a clear benefit of screening for breast cancer in women, especially those aged 40 to 49”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761317"> Anna Wilkinson is a medical doctor. I asked her some questions. She said, “First, regarding the expert involvement, the actual task force and working group for this had no breast cancer experts on it.” Nothing about this makes any sense. My colleague, who is a doctor and whose wife survived breast cancer, said it very well. Why do we as politicians have to stand up and tell this arm of the Public Health Agency that it got it wrong? It is just bizarre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761318">I am going to move on because there are tons of survivors and tons of families. I think it is really important to note that breast cancer impacts not just the person who has been diagnosed; it also impacts a whole community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761319"> Kim MacDonald is a patient advocate for Breast Cancer Canada. She said, “Right now, at stage 0 or stage 1, if it's found that early, as it often is in screening, you have about a 99% survival rate. By the time it gets to stage 4, we're talking about a 31% survival rate.” These are significant numbers. Kim MacDonald also said, “I first want to say how shocked and disappointed I was in the task force recommendation of keeping the breast cancer screening age at 50 and how heartened I am by provinces like Ontario for lowering the age of self-referral to 40.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761323">I brought something up to a couple of witnesses. I said that we literally have not heard from one witness who agreed with the task force chair. The task force chair was the only one. Then she doubled down on an article during committee as sort of a passive-aggressive way of saying that she was right and everybody else was wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761324"> I spoke to Ms. Alethea Kewayosh. She is a director of the indigenous cancer care unit. I asked her whether she thought the chair should resign. That was one of the things I wanted to ask because we have to write recommendations. The point of a study in any committee is recommendations. We were hearing things and wondering what was going on and whether we should disband the task force. In any other world, the person would resign if this is what was happening. Nobody else agreed with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761325">I asked Ms. Kewayosh if she wanted the resignation of the task force chair. She said, “I don't know who he or she is, but he or she is obviously very out of touch with the topic. I'm sure there was a task force struck at one time that created residential schools, and look how well that went over. They need to be more in touch with the topic, then. They need to have understanding of what's happening with community and with people. They need to have their pulse on the hands of what community are saying and what people are saying. They're very out of touch.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761326">I want to say that we need a lot of help in health care in this country. It is one of the biggest things I get asked about. People cannot even get in to see a doctor. Conservatives have a plan. We have talked about the issue in terms of a policy and a solution. It would be called the blue seal program. I know that my colleague has spearheaded it tremendously, to get all of the doctors who are driving for Uber and who are qualified to practice medicine, in order to have access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761327">This sends a bigger message. We need to increase our access to the newest technology like thermogenics. Patients need to have choice and informed consent. We need to give back the power to the women who want to be screened for breast cancer so families do not have to bury their mothers, sisters and daughters.</ParaText>

                <I>Uqaqtittiji</I>, I recently sat on another committee, the status of women committee. It was studying a similar study on breast cancer screening. The topic was specifically on first nations' and indigenous peoples' screening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761329">One of the discussions in the committee was to make sure that there is better access for and representation of indigenous peoples. I wonder whether the member agrees that, with the motion, there also need to be assurances that the task force also focuses its work on ensuring that first nations, Inuit and Métis also get the breast screening they deserve, because for them it is a lot more difficult, especially in Nunavut; my constituents are flown to places like Ottawa, thousands of kilometres away, to have basic access to breast screening, for example.</ParaText>

Multiple witnesses testified about Black women and indigenous women. The research was from the 1980s; it was so outdated. A disproportionate number of women who are Black or indigenous are impacted by breast cancer, but this is not reflected in the task force's recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761331">Therefore 1000%, again, that is what we say. We need updated evidence. As I answered earlier, the task force chair said that the evidence did not even show a clear benefit of screening, yet nobody on the task force represented any of the groups in question, so it makes no sense.</ParaText>

I wonder whether my hon. colleague might like to make some comments around the intrusiveness, the loss of dignity, the loss of employment, the loss of income and, of course, the consequences of treatment inside a family of a woman diagnosed at age 40 to 49 with later-stage breast cancer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761333"> Mr. Speaker, with regard to that age, 40 to 49, I am 45, and I think about the fact that I have aging parents. A woman that age has children. She is trying to make her career. She is trying to pay her bills. She is trying to do all these things, and then, boom, she is not well. She is now not able to go to work or make money. The consequences are devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761334">With respect to prevention, I asked a question to one of the witnesses. I said that I do not understand the recommendation. I asked whether it is a money thing, because that is the only thing I can ever find. I hear things like “Follow the money” and “It costs too much money to do the screening.” The witness talked about how much money we save; Cheryl White, a breast cancer survivor, said, “People talk about the harms of mammograms, but the only harm I can think of is the $75 cost of getting one.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761335">With regard to the money we would save, in terms of the prevention for women who otherwise would have to access medicine and not be able to go to work, and the families impacted, it does not make any sense. We are going to save economically. The impact would be far worse if we did not get early diagnosis.</ParaText>

He is the chair of the committee that produced the report, and I will leave it to him to discuss the very important issues specifically as they relate to the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761337">What I would like to do with my time is point out some issues that I see with, once again, the manner in which the Conservatives are bringing forward motions just to delay and to prevent anything from happening in the House. For starters, the report was endorsed unanimously by the committee. The entire committee voted in favour of it, that is, the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP. There was no dissenting report, to my knowledge. There certainly was not anybody who voted against the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761338">One has to ask themself why the Conservatives would bring the report forward when they know it has been unanimously supported. The only rationale, in answering that question, comes from the same place of so many of the reports from committees having been tabled in the House: Conservatives are just putting up concurrence reports, one after another, every day, because they know it burns away three hours of the day. It is so completely disingenuous. I would argue it actually does a disservice to the very important issue being discussed in the motion and the report as it relates to breast cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761339">The speaker before me read out the motion or report. I will read it myself. It is literally one sentence:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761341">That is the entire report, so I am perplexed. I have been here for nine years, and I have seen so many concurrence reports being tabled and concurrence motions being moved in the last two and a half to three months. In my opinion, it is just another delay tactic of the Conservatives because they are running out of people to speak to the motion on the question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761342">Well over 220 people now have spoken to the motion. To give folks at home who might be watching the proceedings a comparison, there have been, in total, about 22 Liberal, NDP and Bloc speakers, so 22 speakers from four political parties that represent well over the majority of the House, and over 220 Conservatives, who have spoken to that particular motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761343">Why is that important and why is it germane to the discussion we are having today? It is because the Conservatives have run out of talking points. I think AI has just said, “I'm sorry, I cannot produce another speech for you. There have been way too many requests for a 20-minute speech.” The Conservatives are just at a point now where even moving an amendment that resets their speaking order is not effective anymore because literally everybody has said absolutely everything there is to be said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761344">Even sitting in here and listening to Conservatives speak on and on ad nauseam, it is very clear that we drift away into other topics routinely. We are even well beyond the point of anybody's calling relevance anymore, because it is absolutely pointless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761345">I will say that the issue of breast cancer screening is very important to me, and in particular to my wife. There is a history of breast cancer in my wife's family, so she regularly gets screened and tested. When it comes to issues that are so critically important, I do not think we should be using a motion like the one before us, on a report that has been unanimously passed in committee, as a political tool in the House to delay what we talk about and what we do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761346">The reality is that when it comes to an issue that relates to health, it is so critically important that we do everything we can to support women and the proper screening to protect them from possibly being diagnosed with breast cancer. We do a huge disservice to the seriousness that requires when a motion comes from a committee that was unanimously supported, had no dissenting reports and is used as a political tool in this House to slow this place down and create disorder. That is, unfortunately, what we have seen once again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761347">No objective person looking at what has happened and the countless number of concurrence motions that Conservatives have put forward over the last three months could possibly ever come to the conclusion that they are being genuine in their actions. They are not. They are doing this strictly for political reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761348">At the very least, I would ask my Conservative colleagues, if they are going to do that, to please pick some issues that perhaps are not as sensitive to so many people and affect so many people in our country. They should not play politics with an issue like this. In my opinion, it is extremely despicable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761349">In any event, I am going to end there. Like I said, I am sharing my time with a member for <Affiliation DbId="278410" Type="2">Charlottetown</Affiliation>, the chair of this committee. I am sure he can provide much more insight into the discussion that took place when this was at committee. I look forward to hearing what he has to say because I am sure that he will be able to fill the House in on some of the very meaningful discussion that was had around producing this report. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761351">Members in the House come from different parts of the country. Many members have constituencies that are very large with lots of varying issues that people really care about. This Parliament would not be paralyzed if the government would just hand over the documents in their unredacted form. Because there is no Private Members' Business or private members' motions, the only other way to raise issues, apart from Standing Order 31, is to use concurrence reports in order to be able to talk about them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761352">In my family, I do not know of any cases of breast cancer, but my paternal grandfather passed away due to brain cancer here in Canada. That is the reason my family came here from Communist Poland, thanks to a medical exit visa my father was able to get. Cancer touches a lot of Canadians. I think it is disingenuous to accuse us of not having the right motivations. The member heard from two others in the Conservative caucus who gave impassioned pleas for what should be done. This is an opportunity to speak about cancer. I think one in two Canadians, at some point in their lives, will face that diagnosis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761353">Mr. Speaker, my father-in-law passed away at the age of 67, only about five years ago, from brain cancer. It could very well be the exact same form of cancer that the member just spoke about. With all due respect to him, I am not going to be lectured on taking an issue such as cancer seriously when I lost my father-in-law at the age of 67. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761354">Nonetheless, his argument about what we are discussing today would be great if it was not premised on the notion that this House is seized with the position that it is in because of what the Liberal Party has done. On the contrary, the member knows procedure very well. I know that for a fact. He knows what was put forward, at the direction of the Speaker, was a motion to send something to PROC. He can explain to Canadians why he is participating in a filibuster of his own motion to send something to PROC. He put forward a motion that said we should send this to PROC and then refuses to let us vote on it. I would ask him to please not lecture me on being disingenuous.</ParaText>

However, I would remind the member of the actual report. The member asked me a question about what the government is going to do. However, this report that unanimously passed and that we are debating now is about asking the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to urge the task force to go back to the drawing board and revisit the guidelines based on the latest science.

              <ParaText id="8761359">Mr. Speaker, I am the chair of the health committee, so I can probably give the House a bit of the background on how this report came to be and the present status of the issue before the health committee. I am inclined to agree with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> with respect to the motivation behind bringing this motion before the House for concurrence today. I agree that it is unfortunate and unseemly for an issue as deadly, as personal and as sensitive as breast cancer screening to be used as a tool for delay, as was pointed out by my colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761360"> This came before the health committee at the behest of a motion from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278548" Type="2">Fort McMurray—Cold Lake</Affiliation> to have the committee engage in hearing from witnesses on the subject of breast cancer screening guidelines. To go a little further back, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care issued breast cancer screening guidelines in 2018. There have been dramatic developments in medicine and science since 2018, and in May 2024, the task force issued draft guidelines, but those draft guidelines maintained the position taken in 2018, recommending against breast cancer screening for those under the age of 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761361">By that point in time, many of the provinces had already caught up with the developments in medicine and science, and were routinely screening patients under the age of 50. The committee heard from nine witnesses and received 15 briefs, and before embarking on its study, the motion that is the subject of the debate today was pre-emptively moved, amended and unanimously adopted by the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761362"> The work of the committee, throughout the hearings of the witnesses, was non-partisan, was undoubtedly in the best interests of Canadians and showed a positive bias toward evidence, not politics. It was, in my time in the health committee, one of those studies that I would be proud of because of the way parliamentarians worked together, which I think compounds the discomfort that I feel that it is being used in this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761363"> The briefs have been reviewed, the transcripts of evidence have been reviewed and the committee now has in front of it a detailed draft report, which we are going to be looking at the second version of tomorrow. At some point, that report is going to be adopted by the committee. It will undoubtedly include significant recommendations that will be reported back to the House. I would respectfully suggest that the time to be talking about concurrence in a committee report on breast screening guidelines would be on a report that is significantly more comprehensive than a motion that was pre-emptively moved before the deliberations on the report even began.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761364"> More and more women under the age of 50 are being diagnosed with breast cancer. This is what we heard at the committee. The Canadian Cancer Society reports that one in eight Canadian women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and one in 36 will die from it. Last year, there were 30,500 Canadian women who were diagnosed, and given those statistics, 5,500 of them will die from this disease. This is not something to be politicized. This is something that parliamentarians need to take very seriously.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761365">One of the challenges we have with any health care issue is that the health care system in Canada is partially federally funded and completely provincially administered. However, the federal <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has indicated that he is in favour of the measures mentioned in the motion. The overwhelming weight of evidence, along with the overwhelming weight of what we hear from patients, experts and physicians, is that the task force on preventive health care, in its draft guidelines, got it wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761366">The direction from the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, the evidence we heard and the committee is to send the task force back to the drawing board to give some detail to the committee on a robust procedure for determining who gets to sit there, what its mandate is, the depth and breadth of the consultations and the depth and breadth of the things it ought to consider when reviewing and revising these draft guidelines. The task force, as we heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278557" Type="2">Peterborough—Kawartha</Affiliation>, has been widely criticized, and it is a bit of a head-scratcher how it ended up in the same place, given how science and medicine has developed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761367">Part and parcel of the evidence we heard before the health committee on the full report was the need for investment in research and the need for public awareness. This is public awareness for both the general populace and physicians. All of these types of issues are those I fully expect will make their way into the report that will eventually be tabled in the House. As I indicated, that would be something that would provide much more substance for a concurrence motion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761373">Mr. Speaker, this is a very significant issue. I think many, if not most, members of Parliament have lost family members to cancer, of one kind or another. It is a little disappointing to see the amount of time Liberals have devoted in their speeches to partisan talking points about concurrence and aspects of the business of the House.

              <ParaText id="8761374">However, this is an issue on which we should all agree. It does show the orientation of the government that, rather than focusing on constructive solutions for a sensitive issue on which there is general agreement, there is more of a focus on trying to attack the Conservatives. I wonder if the member can just share, and I am trying to get him off some of that partisan tone we especially heard from his colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>, some constructive suggestions for additional steps the House could pursue that would help effectively combat this problem and promote wellness. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761385">Mr. Speaker, it is with great humility, sensitivity and heartfelt thoughts for all those who have lost a loved one to breast cancer that I rise today to speak to this report of the Standing Committee on Health. What is unusual is that the report is not even finished, even though the committee began drafting it last spring. I am deeply humbled to speak this evening because I have some big shoes to fill. That is because I am filling in for my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278281" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation>, who is an excellent health critic and one of the co-chairs of the Standing Committee on Health, which examined this issue. I will try my best to do him justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761386">This report addresses the crucial and important issue of national breast cancer screening standards. Although the report has yet to be completed, there seems to be some consensus that the screening age should be lowered to 40. Study after study and report after report have confirmed it. My colleague, the health critic and member for Montcalm, has given me his seat on the Standing Committee on Health for the women's health study. In addition, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women also began a supplementary study focusing more specifically on breast cancer screening standards at age 40. We are starting to hear a lot of testimony about lowering the screening age from 50 to 40. After my speech, I have to go back to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women for instructions for the report on that topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761387">I will begin by summing up the issue of standards for screening at age 40. I will then talk about other recommendations on women's health. I will close by highlighting the importance of health care transfers for giving the health care system more resources. Towards the end of my speech, I am going to broaden the debate a little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761388">I will begin with a little background information. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended screening at age 50 as a national standard. People started speaking out to explain that the global trend was more in favour of starting screening at age 40. The Standing Committee on Health heard this perspective during a study on women's health. It then undertook a study specifically focusing on standards for breast cancer screening starting at age 40. As I said earlier, a short time later, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women decided to draft its own report on the age 40 standards. At first, we planned to meet twice, but more meeting hours and more witnesses were subsequently added. That is why we still do not have the report in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761389">Expert testimonies are more or less unanimous. In contrast, the members of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care are having a hard time explaining their position. A few lines have been put forward. There are more and more studies demonstrating the importance of prevention when it comes to breast cancer. There are also more and more international examples and figures showing that it costs less to treat cancers that are caught at a less aggressive stage. Then there is also the fact that early detection increases the chances of survival and reduces the impact on quality of life. If we lower the screening age to 40, however, the federal government will have to make a contribution, give the means and provide the health transfers. I will come back to that later. I should point out that this could result in savings. More than $460 million could be saved with early protection and screening. Investing in screening is a good thing. It is in no way an expense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761390">We also learned that many experts had tried to contact the task force with their comments. However, they were reportedly ignored. Non-disclosure agreements were even signed to silence witnesses. Questions are being asked about the composition of this group. Survivors came forward to explain that their perspective was non-existent in this task force.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761391">It was also found that some communities were disproportionately and differently affected by breast cancer. This includes Black communities and indigenous communities. There was even a lot of talk about the issue of women from the Philippines. There are different points of view that were not taken into account by the task force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761392">Women must certainly not be prevented from asking to be tested before age 50, the age currently recommended by the task force. That is more or less what we were told. We have some international examples. That was an important starting point for our reflection process and the start of this study. There are international studies, for example in the United States, that show the importance of making this shift. In April, the United States Preventive Services Task Force published an update on its 2016 recommendation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761393">That update reads as follows: “Previously, we recommended that women in their 40s make an individual decision with their clinician on when they should start screening, taking into account their health history, preferences, and how they value the different potential benefits and harms. The Task Force now recommends that all women start getting screened for breast cancer every other year starting at age 40. Basically, it’s a shift from recommending women start screening between the ages of 40 and 50 to recommending that all women start getting screened when they turn 40.” That is what it says on the website of the U.S. task force. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761394">Even here in Canada, women in British Columbia and Yukon can start asking for mammograms at age 40. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island offer annual mammogram screening for women who are asymptomatic. In Ontario, the age of eligibility for publicly funded mammograms changed from 50 to 40 in October. This shows that the trend toward starting screening at age 40 is becoming increasingly widespread.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761395">Even in Quebec, the minister of health, Christian Dubé, recently commissioned a task force to study the possibility of lowering the age of preventive screening to age 40. The findings could not be clearer. After instructing the Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux, or INESSS, to assess the possibility of expanding breast cancer screening to start at age 40, Quebec's health minister, Christian Dubé, says that the cost is worth it. It is therefore hard to understand why the Canadian task force is digging in its heels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761396">In addition, the Canadian Cancer Society issued a press release in May urging the provinces and territories to lower the eligibility age for breast screening programs to 40 for individuals at an average risk of developing breast cancer. This recommendation has been made by Quebec, the provinces, other countries and even organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761397">Second, I would like to come back to a study that the Standing Committee on Health is currently conducting on women's health. If everything goes smoothly, the committee will begin studying the report tomorrow. Several different topics have been discussed. The gender health gap exists and has been proven. One of the issues is medical bias.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761398">Yesterday, I met with representatives of a brand new clinic that opened this year. This clinic seeks to be more inclusive and to offer services to women in the LGBTQ community who have difficulty finding their place in the health care system and who experience medical bias. I met representatives of this clinic at the recent Emergence Gala. Yesterday, we talked for over an hour and they did a great job of explaining this reality to me, including the fact that women do not always feel that they have a place in the health care system. They do not always feel as though they are being listened to in the current health care system. They are discriminated against. The clinic I am talking about is Vivago, an inclusive health care clinic. We really had a great discussion. We promised to do it again and to stay in touch so that we can continue to share information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761399">During this study, we also examined the issue of endometriosis and other gynecological problems. As we have heard, for a long time, endometriosis was just seen as a problem experienced by women who were not strong enough to endure the pain. For a long time, there was persistent bias regarding this condition. Proper investments were not made in research because endometriosis was considered a woman's problem that was not important.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761400">Obviously, in the recommendations, we hope that there will be more research on this front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761401">It is the same for cancer. There is breast cancer screening for women. As I was saying, we examined this issue because the study on women's health came before the study on the rules around screening at age 40. The question of gynecological cancers is an interesting one. Cervical cancer is rare, but we now have a vaccine that can prevent it. The World Health Organization believes in it strongly, and Canada has set targets. When we heard from the experts during the study, they made it clear that we are missing the target. However, vaccine procurement is the federal government's responsibility. Quebec and the provinces are responsible for health administration, but health transfers and procurement are the federal government's responsibility. There are some things that the government could be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761402">Another issue is women's mental health. How long were women treated as hysterical? Postpartum depression was observed in women, but it was trivialized for a long time, despite increasing evidence that it was real. During the study on women's health, the committee also heard that it has an impact not only on the mother, but also on the children and the entire family. People used to think it was because she had just given birth and that she would recover. Now we are starting to take postpartum depression more seriously and treating it as a real condition, not just as the whim of a woman who is too weak psychologically to cope with the presence of a new child after giving birth. Could more research be done to find better ways to help and support women when they are going through what should be one of the best experiences of their lives, and to support them through it all?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761403">In the end, the study was quite broad. I look forward to seeing what happens next. There were instructions for the report, but now we are beginning to study the report, and we will see what recommendations are made in the coming weeks and months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761404">Third, this is, of course, going to take resources. That is why I am going to end my speech by talking about health transfers. For example, in Quebec, the government's challenge is to expand access to mammography to women aged 40 to 74. That involves guaranteeing reasonable wait times in all regions of Quebec. As the study on women's health showed, there are still too many women who do not have access to the same services because of where they live. The services offered in rural areas are not the same. How can we ensure that wait times are the same in every region of Quebec?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761405">Quebec's health minister calculated that, if women in their forties were included in routine screening, it would require 100,000 to 150,000 more mammograms a year. That will cost money, but it should not be a reason not to move forward and work on the issue of screening. So many survivors told the committee how important prevention is. I spoke about savings earlier, but the treatment is not the same for stage 1, stage 2 or stage 4 cancer. The effects on the body and the long-term impacts are not the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761406">It is important to take all of that into consideration and not just decide that we cannot afford to implement this recommendation. We have to find a way. As I said earlier, the government has been reducing its investments for a long time. Remember that initially, the federal government's share of the transfers was 50%. This is one budget item that must not be cut in the name of austerity. On the contrary, it should be increased. Quebec and the provinces have unanimously called for a 35% contribution. It is currently barely reaching 20%. That is not enough. I think we can and must do better at making sure we can offer mammograms starting at age 40. That is why the federal government must respond to this request and plan for better transfers for the future than what it is offering right now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761407">In closing, I also want to say that I asked the witnesses questions in committee because more and more young women in their thirties and forties are dealing with aggressive forms of cancer. The issue has come up a lot lately. For example, there was the high-profile case of entrepreneur Geneviève Everell, who shared her story. During her second pregnancy, she was diagnosed with cancer that needed to be treated soon. For the time being, she is doing well. She gave interviews and explained what she was going through. She found out in the middle of her pregnancy that she was going to have to deliver her baby after she started cancer treatment. Evidently, it is no illusion; these cancers really are affecting younger and younger women more and more aggressively. This has an impact on the whole family and everyone around them. Truly, Geneviève Everell, whom I do not know personally—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761411"> Madam Speaker, we can never have too many Stewarts in the House of Commons. We are holding up the Scottish front over here.

              <ParaText id="8761412">Today I will speak again about the production of documents ordered by the House on the Liberal green slush fund scandal. Who would have thought I would ever quote from a Toronto Star article? This is what they said in an article just yesterday. I will quote the Toronto Star, the very publication in which I used to read my Toronto Maple Leafs news until they did not like Darcy Tucker, and then I could not agree with them anymore. I am actually going to go out of my way and quote them:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761413">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Since late September, [the leader of the Conservatives] has gummed up most parliamentary proceedings in an effort to compel the Liberal government to cough up unredacted documents tied to a now-defunct green technology funding agency that was riddled with mismanagement issues.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761414"> Imagine the Toronto Star actually calling out the Liberals for the green slush fund being “riddled with mismanagement issues”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761415"> As I have stated before, it is an honour and a privilege to be a member of the public accounts committee. Since we received the damning report from the Auditor General last June, where she found that the Liberal government has turned the once legitimate Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders, we have been trying to get to the bottom of this conflict of interest scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761416">Any good crisis manager brought in to try to get a handle on a scandal of this magnitude, of the Liberal green slush fund, always starts with chronology. Some of us may recall, in my last speech in this place, I discussed the chronological order around the suspicious appointment of Annette Verschuren as chair of the Liberal green slush fund in June 2019, when the culture of corruption really began. I said in my last speech that the lack of consistency in witness testimony around the chair's appointment certainly looked like a cover-up at the highest levels of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761417">It has only gotten worse this last month. Former industry minister Navdeep Bains has now testified twice at the public accounts committee and at least once at the industry committee. He cannot recall anything to do with his involvement in asking Ms. Verschuren to take on the chair role, even though he was told directly by the SDTC president that it was a really bad idea because of conflict of interest concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761418">I was able to question the former minister myself, but I am going to take us back a little bit to the 1980s. Most of us today are watching <I>Yellowstone</I>, some of us at least, but in the eighties, it was <I>Dallas</I> or <I>Dynasty</I>, <I>Dallas</I> in particular. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761419">There is a reason I am going to talk about <I>Dallas</I> right now and a reason it relates to this speech. Can we remember that crucial episode that everybody was tuning in for, “Who Shot J.R.”? Was it his younger brother? Was it his disgruntled ex-wife? Was it other members of the family? Everybody had to tune in to find out who shot J.R. It was talked about so much, yet I do not even remember who shot J.R. Maybe I was too young to realize it at the time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761420">My point, though, is that, when I was questioning former minister Bains and when several of these former bureaucrats were brought in for questioning, they all had something in common, something that reminds me of daytime soaps that my mom used to watch, like <I>Another World</I> or <I>Dynasty</I> or <I>General Hospital</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761421">Do we remember that the cast members of these shows would get something called amnesia? I questioned many of these bureaucrats that are now in different positions or retired, or even the minister. Nobody seems to know anything. That is the one trend that persists through everything. Today, we want the production of documents. We want these documents tabled. We want to get to the bottom of this, but everybody who comes in does not remember anything. Sometimes I question if they remember their own names.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761422">Some people did not even want to show up to these meetings, so they had to be dragged in here to the bar, a practice that I do not believe was used for 100 years. Maybe I have that a bit off, but my point here is that nobody remembers their own actions. Nobody remembers what they did when they were hired to work for the Canadian public. Nobody remembers what they did. Ministers do not remember what directives were given. Deputy ministers do not remember things they passed on to their assistant deputy ministers. Nobody remembers anything. It is unbelievable. I have never witnessed anything like it in all my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761423">Since my last speech, we have heard from more witnesses at the public accounts committee, but the two who stand out in their utmost ridiculousness are the former deputy minister and former assistant deputy minister from the industry department. As my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> has said, they all must have watched old episodes of <I>Hogan's Heroes</I> because they all parroted Sergeant Schultz's famous lines: I see nothing. I hear nothing. I know nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761424">My point is, how come nobody remembers anything? How come nobody remembers? When this much money was given out illegally, nobody remembers what they did. The Canadian public is not fooled by this. People are going to be watching and they are going to say, of course they remember; they are just not telling because it is wrong, illegal, fraudulent or whatever word they want to use. We may have to call in public health officials because there has clearly been an outbreak of amnesia in every official who has been called to testify thus far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761425">The Merriam-Webster Dictionary has three definitions for “amnesia”. Number one is “loss of memory due usually to brain injury, shock, fatigue, depression, or illness”. Number two is “a gap in one's memory”. Number three is “the selective overlooking or ignoring of events...that are not favourable or useful to one's purpose or position”. I think we can all agree with and select door number three as the right definition for all the officials who have appeared at public accounts and are clearly suffering from amnesia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761426">The former deputy minister from the industry department testified that he has no recollection of Ms. Verschuren's appointment as chair of the Liberal green slush fund in June 2019 because he was retiring that month. He may have forgotten that he was still employed and he was still working on behalf of the people, but he forgot everything because his retirement was more important than the millions of dollars that went out illegally and fraught with scandal and conflicts of interest. He speculated that the president of SDTC did not warn him about the conflict of interest mess because she knew he was retiring. I see nothing. I hear nothing. I know nothing. The trend continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761427">Speaking of retirements, I find it rather convenient how many officials chose to retire from the public service once the Auditor General received the whistle-blower's information and began her investigation into the Liberal green slush fund. It is like all the officials saw what was coming and got out of Dodge, or in this case, out of Ottawa. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761428">Let us go back to the former deputy minister from the industry department, who testified to the public accounts committee that he placed his former assistant deputy minister on the SDTC board as his “eyes and ears”. We will see how well that was working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761429">The former assistant deputy minister, who also retired last year, sat on every board meeting for over five years while $330 million of taxpayers' money was gifted to companies with which the board members had conflicts of interest, and not just conflicts of interest but known conflicts of interest. The former assistant deputy minister sat on every board meeting while another $59 million in projects that were not eligible for funding because they were outside the foundation's mandate were still approved. They were still approved by these very people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761430"> The former assistant deputy minister sat in every board meeting where the Auditor General found that at least 10 of the projects did not even produce green technology or contribute to emissions reductions. The former assistant deputy minister told the public accounts committee a variety of fairy tales. He said it was a well-run board and it was not his job to review conflicts of interest, even though his former deputy minister called him his “eyes and ears” on the board of directors. The former assistant deputy minister also said it was his experience that the Liberal green slush fund's board members recused themselves whenever they had conflicts of interest. They would have had to recuse themselves 200 times, or just shy of that, that we know of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761431">However, the Ethics Commissioner, in his “Verschuren Report”, stated the former chair did not recuse herself but abstained from voting when her own multi-million dollar projects were approved. Similarly, other board members of the Liberal green slush fund did not recuse themselves but abstained when voting themselves more than $6.6 million in funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761432">I will try to explain the semantics, because “recusal” and “abstaining” are not quite the same. When growing up, some of us had a great aunt who, whenever she came for a visit, always wanted a hug and a kiss. I have had a few of them, and some I welcomed. We knew it was coming every time she visited, but we would squirm and accept the affection. That is abstaining. However, a recusal is when we knew our great aunt was coming for a visit and we made the conscious decision to not be there when she arrived, so that way we avoided the hugs and kisses outright. We recused ourselves from that sort of affection. That is my example. I know it is a little bizarre, but this is me. I am a product of my environment, and Miramichi—Grand Lake would like that idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761433">The Merriam-Webster Dictionary's definition of “abstaining” is interesting. The first is “to choose not to do or have something”. The second is “to refrain deliberately and often with an effort of self-denial from an action or practice”, such as to “abstain from drinking”. Third is “to choose not to vote”, as in “Ten members voted for the proposal, six members voted against it, and two abstained.” The Merriam-Webster Dictionary's definition of “recusal” says, first, “to disqualify (oneself) as judge in a particular case” and, two, “to remove (oneself) from participation to avoid a conflict of interest”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761434">For the former assistant deputy minister from the industry department, who attended every single meeting of the Liberal green slush fund's board of directors, to confuse “abstaining” with “recusal” is indicative of all the normal shenanigans that have occurred in this scandal to date. Here are the assistant deputy minister's exact words at the public accounts committee last week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761435">He said, “What I saw in front of me at SDTC was a regularly functioning board where people would recuse themselves when they thought there was a real reason to.” He also said, “I had no way of independently assessing conflicts of interest by the board.... I'm not a lawyer.” He further said, “I had very limited information upon which to look at issues of conflict of interest”. Here is another quote: “I had no way to independently assess, Mr. Chair, what holdings individual board members had or who, in fact” was in a conflict of interest. He is clearly the best and brightest. As well, he said, “I could only speak to my deputy minister about what I saw in front of me. The conflicts of interest, which have since come to light with the organization, were not obvious to me. They were not presented in a way that caused me sufficient concern”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761436">These are the exact words of the former assistant deputy minister, whose role it was to be the eyes and ears of the industry department at the Liberal green slush fund board of directors. Again, I see nothing. I hear nothing. I know nothing. The trend continues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761437">The lack of accountability and responsibility by the very bureaucrats whose role it was to ensure taxpayers' money was being properly spent is shocking to me, and it is shocking to the members of my party. All of my colleagues are deeply shocked, and the lack of oversight by both former industry minister Bains and the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> is outrageous</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761438">To recap, we had Annette Verschuren originally tell the industry committee she did not apply for the chair's role on the Liberal green slush fund. She said former industry minister Navdeep Bains called her two or three times, asking her to take on the role. This is after a nearly year-long competition process had been run by the PCO. It had gathered almost 100 names of interested clean tech experts, but the former industry minister does not recall ever calling Ms. Verschuren about chairing the Liberal green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761439"> Something is not right here. Again, it is, “I see nothing, I hear nothing, and I know nothing”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761440"> It was interesting when I got to question former minister Bains. Ms. Verschuren said she was asked on several occasions and over the phone by Minister Bains himself to take on the position. Minister Bains said that he never called her, but somehow, strangely, he admitted to calling hundreds of other people to tell them when certain board appointments were becoming available. The one he did not remember calling was Ms. Verschuren, but she says that he called her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761441"> Is this why the Liberal government is refusing to give Parliament the unredacted documents relevant to their green slush fund? Is it a cover-up for the former industry minister or the current one? I want to know why the government would want Parliament to deal with this for so long. Let us just think about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761442"> These documents could provide the missing proof that all of this was totally corrupt and totally scandalous. The last time I spoke on this, I remember talking about the sponsorship scandal and how this scandal is eight times larger. I can remember back when the sponsorship scandal was a big deal in our country and everybody was talking about it. It was dominating headlines. It was dominating journalists. It was dominating everything, in terms of the political landscape, but this one is eight times larger than that, and all we are asking for is documents that the government should be providing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761443"> We have had a series of faceless bureaucrats, who come in and basically do not admit anything they did. They are all retired, or the have entered into a new position, and this is not the type of thing Canadians want to pay for. Canadians want the bureaucracy to provide good service, to give good advice and, definitely, to do a good job with helping to get value for taxpayers' dollars, because public money is being spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761444"> Taxpayers' dollars are being spent on these projects, and the bureaucrats are not getting value for money. That is one of our primary focuses at public accounts, and it was interesting to me. Witnesses would come in, and they might as well have spat in our faces. However, it is not so much that they were spitting in my face; they are spitting in the face of the taxpayers of this country, because $400 million was wasted. It was all gotten illegally. It is fraudulent. There were nearly 200 conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761445"> We are trying to get the documents, and the government is literally allowing this. The Liberals will not come clean. This is a cover-up.</ParaText>

We have been debating this question of privilege for five weeks now, and most of the House's work has been stalled. The Conservative Party has been saying for months, years even, that it has no confidence in the current Liberal government. For the past five weeks, the Conservatives have had the opportunity to bring down this government by asking for a confidence vote, but they are waiting for their opposition day to be on the agenda before finally putting forward a non-confidence motion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761491"> Madam Speaker, we can talk about déjà vu all over again. It is another day here in Ottawa; most Canadians would expect to see the NDP-Liberal government working to put out the many fires it has lit that are raging across the country: an economic recession, the housing and affordability crisis, disorder at the border, trade relations with the United States and seniors who have had to take a second job just to pay for essentials. It is crisis after crisis. Instead, we are again debating a privilege motion related to the green slush fund because the Liberals would rather cover up their role in the affair than deal with the problems, even if that means Canadians suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761492"> We are here again because the Liberal government has failed to turn over documents to the RCMP regarding a $400-million scandal that saw the Liberal-appointed executives funnel money to their own companies, implicating them in 186 conflicts of interest. Not so long ago, it would have made national headlines to have a scandal of such epic proportions. It would have been plastered on every newspaper from coast to coast to coast. However, after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, it is just another Wednesday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761493">What is another scandal or another cover-up when there seems to be a new one every month? After all, we have seen this many times before in the last nine years. The green slush fund is just the latest. We have seen the Aga Khan scandal, cash for access, the SNC-Lavalin affair, the WE Charity controversy, clam scam, ArriveCAN and the two Randys. It goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761494"> When I look at the state of our country and the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, I am reminded of what I saw during the big Netflix fight, the Tyson versus Paul fight. When most of us were looking to watch the fight, our screen suddenly froze. There was this spinning circle that we were all staring at, stuck in place, going nowhere. We had hopes and expectations of moving forward; instead, we saw buffering, buffering, buffering. In many ways, that is also why we are here today as a country: We are not moving forward. We are buffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761495"> People feel stuck in place as their savings dwindle and their paycheques stop covering everyday expenses. Not so long ago, they had hopes, dreams and plans for the future; they do not anymore. When we look at the NDP-Liberal government, it is also stuck in place with no plan, no idea of how to fix the budget and address the economic disaster it has inflicted on Canadians. It has no plan to secure our borders. Therefore, it is forced to cover up its wrongdoing, and it would rather have the House remain in a standstill than face the consequences of its actions. It is buffering. We need strong leadership to restore the promise of Canada. Common-sense Conservatives will provide that leadership to this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761496">I should also mention that the real winner the night of the great Netflix boxing event was Pefferlaw's own Melinda Watpool. Melinda made everyone so proud that night in York—Simcoe as she continued to earn the World Boxing Organization's women's super middleweight title.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761497">Returning to the matter at hand, this shameful cover-up, sadly, is just another in a long list of scandals and failures from the weak, inept NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761498">In her damning report, the Auditor General called out the former Sustainable Development Technology Canada agency for “significant lapses” in its oversight and management of taxpayers' dollars. Does this sound familiar? The Auditor General said almost the exact same thing this past Monday in her report on the CEBA loan program, which saw $3.5 billion in taxpayer money paid to 77,160 recipients who were not eligible to receive it. It is unbelievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761499">It was not always like this. Not so long ago, the Liberal government used to brag about its supposed ambition to grow the middle class. We can recall that the first chapter in the 2015 Liberal platform was entitled “Growth for the Middle Class”. As well, the front of the 2019 platform read, “Forward: A Real Plan for the Middle Class”. Now, instead of looking to grow the middle class, the Liberals have admitted that because of them, a middle-class lifestyle is now out of reach for far too many. It used to be an attainable expectation of most Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761500">The contrast could not be any starker when we look at what the Liberals are focused on today. Considering the lengths they will go to, to cover up the green slush fund affair, we can imagine the buzzwords on the cover of their 2025 platform: corruption, waste, mismanagement, absolute failure. That is their focus now, not the middle class, not improving our country. Their focus is on themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761501">It is no wonder Canadians are suffering. Despite the suffering that can be seen on every street corner, in every checkout line and at every fuel pump, members opposite continue to gaslight Canadians. When Conservatives bring up the affordability crisis, the Liberals just fall back on their big-ticket measures. They pat themselves on the back. They point at the GST tax trick, carbon tax rebates, $10-a-day day care, school lunches or the fake pharmacare plan and say, “Look what we have done.” In reality, each of these measures is proof of the economic devastation the NDP-Liberal government has wrought on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761502">It was not that long ago that Canadians did not need to look to the federal government for assistance to such a degree. People had good-paying jobs. Kids going hungry at school was absolutely unthinkable. In civil society, charitable groups stepped up to ensure the less fortunate were looked after. The Liberals, with their great ambition of transforming the country into their own image, have forced far too many Canadians into impoverishment, where even the most basic essentials have become unaffordable. It is a problem of the government's own making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761503">With Canadians suffering, the government comes up with poorly implemented programs to paper over the cracks and cover up the impacts of its disastrous economic policies. Canadians see right through this. They know what the Liberals have actually done. It is right there in black and white. People see it every day when they look at their gas and home heating bills, and when they compare them to their carbon tax rebate. They see how meaningless this 60-day GST tax trick rebate will be on their grocery bill when every item on it has skyrocketed in price despite shrinking in size.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8761504">The same applies to each of the headline programs the Liberals implemented, which only made things worse. They were supposed to help, but they came at a significant cost to taxpayers. Similarly, Canadians see right through the antics of the government in shutting down the business of the House to cover up their scandals. They see the lengths the Liberals will go to avoid accountability, and they recognize the serious nature of the revelations of this scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761505">This week, the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> was asked why she had still not released the public accounts and why there was still not an economic fall statement. She refused to say why the public accounts had not been released, and on the fall economic statement, she said, “I don't have an announcement to make.... The reality is business of the House is being filibustered. That has...consequences [for] the work we need to do for Canadians.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761506">However, the only people responsible for stopping the work of the House and dealing with government business are those in the NDP-Liberal government. They could choose to release the unredacted slush fund documents, but they refuse to. The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has already told the government that our party is willing to stand down on this order to get the economic statement tabled, but the government will not. It is because the Liberals do not want Canadians to know the dismal fiscal state the country is in as we head into the Christmas holiday. It is very likely because things are far worse than they have let on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761507">Last year, the<Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4"> Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a commitment that the deficit would be no greater than $40.1 billion. This was the red line. All evidence would now suggest that this is yet another cover-up. She has broken this promise yet again, which will have devastating impacts on interest rates, investor confidence and economic outlook in the coming month. On this side of the House, we have watched 20 or 30 questions asked of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Deputy Prime Minister: “What is the deficit number? Does anyone have it on the other side of the House?” After asking the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Finance Minister</Affiliation> 20 times, I wish there was one Liberal-NDP member in the House who would give the number. It is getting painful to watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761508">By refusing to turn over the documents related to the SDTC, the Liberals have shown their contempt for the will of the House of Commons, and by extension, democracy itself. Democracy has become a very inconvenient concept for the NDP-Liberal government that, may I remind everyone, was only elected with 32% of the popular vote. The Liberal government has held on to record low polling this whole past year. Liberals do not want to go to Canadians and account for their record in an election. They do not want to justify their terrible policies, such as the carbon tax. We just saw today the provincial leader of the Ontario Liberals, Bonnie Crombie herself, say the carbon tax is bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761509">The Liberals do not want to listen to us, as members of Parliament, when we point out the issues our constituents face. They do not want to be accountable when they are found out for their incompetence and wrongdoing, which is why they refuse to hand over these documents. Instead, they want to run this country into the ground for as long as they possibly can and turn it into a place where Liberal grifters and insiders are the only ones who will become better off.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761510">The actions the NDP-Liberal government has taken in covering up its scandals and prioritizing its interests over our citizens has fundamentally undermined the public interest. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his caucus are more interested in protecting the tattered remains of their image instead of addressing the problems at hand. They care more about hiding their mistakes than fixing them. The implication of their utter failure to put people over partisanship is the most damning aspect of this whole thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761511"> At a time when our country is facing skyrocketing crime, immigration fraud and misuse of taxpayer funds by governments and organizations, it is especially concerning to see the cover-up taking place here. The message being sent from the very top, from the NDP-Liberal government, is that accountability, transparency and ethical vigour can be ignored. With this sort of example coming from the very top, it is no wonder we are seeing so much disorder and chaos in our communities. This is not what Canadians want. This is not why they elected us and sent us here; they want competence from their government, strength, a sense of duty and a commitment to our country and our shared values. All too often, it looks like the Liberal-NDP government has lost sight of that. More so, it looks like it has forgotten the values that are supposed to unite us and draw us together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761512">Common-sense Conservatives have not forgotten. We have a vision for this country that would see a restoration of the formula that used to work here, a formula that has become broken. This formula, the promise of Canada, was that a good job and hard work would lead to good pay. That pay would go toward the essentials of life, like a good home and good food, and the rest would allow someone to save, plan and invest in a future. That was the promise of Canada that must be restored. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761513">At the same time, Conservatives want to bring home accountability to Ottawa, to put an end to the Prime Minister's corruption and put an end to bad practices, red tape and high-priced consultants that have led to so many of these scandals and ethical breaches by the Liberals. This may come as a shock to some people here in the Ottawa bubble, but normal Canadians do not pay a lot of attention to what goes on here. Most probably do not even know that the House is seized with this issue. Some do not even know that MPs go to Ottawa. They probably think that caucus is a dirty word. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761514">This has always been the case. Members of Parliament are elected to represent people and do the job of governance on their behalf, but every so often, good, honest, hard-working folks, who are usually preoccupied with providing for their families, building their businesses or contributing to their community start to pay more attention. They are paying attention now because the party that formed government, the Liberal Party of Canada, whose members were elected to look out for the best interests of the country, is failing them. Canadians are tuning in to see what their leaders are doing to address the problems Canadians are facing every day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761515">Common-sense Conservatives will be focused on axing the tax, fixing the budget, building the homes and stopping the crime. Conservatives have solutions for those problems and the leadership and convictions to bring it home. </ParaText>

I know my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278262" Type="2">Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock</Affiliation>, our capable indigenous affairs critic, will be there. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> will be there. There is another member from Ontario, whose riding has the word “lake” in it, who will be there, as well as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278517" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761543">This will be an important event because we have been trying to get the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> to come before committee to answer questions about the scandal. He will finally be there, and we will put to him the harm that has been done by false claims of indigenous identity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761544">Here is the scandal we are dealing with: The government says that over 5% of contracts go to indigenous firms, but the Assembly of First Nations says that it is closer to 1%. In other words, the majority of those benefiting from this indigenous procurement program are shell companies. There are shell companies and shady joint venture arrangements that allow non-indigenous companies to take the vast majority of the benefit, and there are outright pretenders, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, who, through their companies, are taking advantage of programs that were intended for indigenous people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761545">This is an overwhelming situation of abuse by non-indigenous elites and insiders, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. The member for Edmonton Centre, during the period when he was not a member of Parliament, set up a company, and that company claimed to be fully indigenous-owned to try to get contracts from the government. It did get some contracts from the government, but the company made the claim to be fully indigenous-owned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761546">Incredibly, the former minister says that he did not know and it was his wild partner making these claims. Why did the former minister's partner think the company was indigenous-owned? Maybe it is because the Liberal Party of Canada repeatedly and falsely claimed that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> was indigenous. There is a proliferation of those pretending to be indigenous. According to the AFN and other indigenous leaders, there is a massive scale of indigenous identity fraud, as these non-indigenous elite insiders try to take contracts and steal benefits that were supposed to be for indigenous people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761547">Meanwhile, not a single firm has ever faced consequences for indigenous identity fraud. The Liberals have set up a system where, instead of the indigenous communities themselves doing so, the government controls the list of what is considered an indigenous business, which many have called a colonial system. The government set up a system where it controls who is on that list. Many people made it on that list, or otherwise bid on contracts, falsely claiming to be indigenous. There have been zero consequences for anyone, including the former minister, who still continues to be a member of the Liberal caucus and still claims his innocence. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761551">There are huge opportunities for growth and economic development. The Indigenomics Institute estimates that the indigenous economy has the potential to grow from $32 billion to $100 billion in the next five years. The mandatory minimum 5% indigenous procurement target requires that at least 5% of the value of federal contracts is awarded to indigenous businesses. This ensures that procurement officers are considering indigenous businesses when procuring goods and services like office equipment, engineering services, technology and transportation, and the list goes on. These programs help indigenous businesses win contracts, generate revenue, gain experience and build networks, and all of this can be leveraged to win larger contracts with both public and private industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761552">Indigenous procurement programs are a step toward making sure that indigenous people have equitable access to economic success and self-generated wealth. Simply put, these programs move the needle. In 2022-23, which is the most recent year we have data for, more than 300 indigenous businesses won contracts with a value of at least $10,000 through the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761553">As a government, we understand that listening to indigenous people and acting on their advice leads to optimal outcomes. As we have heard from so many indigenous partners, these programs create opportunities and they are an essential part of economic reconciliation. Indigenous leaders have also been clear that these kinds of procurement programs should stay. Unfortunately, Conservatives have refused to say if they support that 5% minimum procurement target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761554">In 2021, the Liberals began a five-year process to engage partners and co-develop a transformative indigenous procurement strategy to improve existing indigenous procurement policies and programs. As part of this work, partners around the table, including the Assembly of First Nations, ITK, the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association and the Canadian Council for Indigenous Business, have all been clear that indigenous people must be the ones determining who qualifies as an indigenous business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761555">The government wholly agrees and we are focused on collaboratively determining a path forward to transfer the administration of the indigenous business directory to indigenous partners. While we work toward this transfer and the co-development of a transformative indigenous procurement strategy, we will continue to diligently manage the directory, and support these vital and meaningful programs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761565">Madam Speaker, we are adapting our immigration plan to suit the needs of Canadian families and communities today. For the first time in our nation's history, we have set targets for temporary residents in our immigration levels plan. That means that all temporary resident programs, like those for international students and temporary foreign workers, will have limits, just as there are for permanent resident programs each year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761566">By taking these steps, we are helping to preserve the integrity of our immigration system, responding to community needs and ensuring that newcomers to Canada are set up for success, with access to adequate resources to support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761567"> We have also reduced our permanent resident targets. Our focus for new permanent residents will be to attract the skilled workers we need to build new homes and provide patient care, and to focus on transitioning temporary residents to permanent residents. These are workers and families who are already here, are supporting our economy, have already adjusted to life in Canada and are best positioned for success over the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761568">The latest levels plan reaffirms our commitment to reducing temporary resident volumes to 5% of Canada's population by the end of 2026. These reductions are the result of a series of changes over the past year, including a cap on the number of international students and tightened eligibility requirements for temporary foreign workers.</ParaText>

It sets targets for temporary residents for the first time ever, lowering our permanent resident program targets to reduce pressure on families and communities. The plan is expected to bring our population levels back to prepandemic projections, and it is expected to reduce the housing supply gap by approximately 670,000 units by the end of 2027.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8761582">It is an honour to rise virtually tonight on a snowy night in Ottawa to pursue a question I originally asked on October 25. It related to the regulation and management of pesticides in this country, particularly a class of chemicals referred to as “neonicotinoid insecticides”. I have to say that the response from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278578" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> was excellent. I almost felt it was wrong to ask the question in Adjournment Proceedings, but events have continued to move ahead on this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761583"> What I raised in question period on that day referenced an in-depth investigation by one of Canada's better investigative journalists and newspapers. That is the National Observer, which is online. They documented that the Pest Management Regulatory Agency of the Government of Canada had colluded with Bayer, the manufacturer of neonicotinoid insecticides. We used to think of Bayer only as the nice provider of aspirin, but it is the producer of a lot of pesticides. It undermined the research of a Canadian researcher, Christy Morrissey, and prolonged the use of chemicals that we know to be dangerous to human health and that science knows are also particularly dangerous for pollinators. We desperately need pollinators for the health of ecosystems and for agriculture. If we lose them, it will be a multi-billion dollar hit to the economy. This is not to mention that these chemicals are dangerous, as I said, to human health and the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761584"> We should have banned these pesticides by now, but I have to say, it appears that between Health Canada and Environment Canada, the Government of Canada has been investigating the role of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency in response to my question, including with the pesticide manufacturer. That was documented in a further article by the same researcher from the National Observer. On the same day that I asked the question, the journalist in question, Marc Fawcett-Atkinson, published an article entitled “Health Canada probes claim that government officials helped pesticide company overturn a ban”. There is a series of articles, for those who wish to look, that are looking at the deep connection, the collusion between pesticide manufacturers and our regulatory agency in protecting pesticides instead of protecting human health and the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761585">In the debate at Adjournment Proceedings tonight, which I am honoured to participate in again, I really hope that the Government of Canada is ready to step forward. Since I asked my question, a huge coalition of environmental and health protection groups, with independent scientific support, have been asking the federal <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to at least temporarily ban the toxic insecticides known as neonicotinoid insecticides until an independent panel of experts can determine whether the benefits outweigh the known risks. Of course, no one can call an insecticide or any toxic chemical safe. I really hope that the Minister of Health, or whichever parliamentary secretary is on hand tonight, can give us an update on this process and encourage us to believe that we can, at long last, move for at least a temporary ban on one of them.

They make decisions that are guided by rigorous scientific principles and rooted in objective scientific evidence.

              <ParaText id="8761590">Public consultations are required on all proposed major decisions and do not compromise PMRA's decisions. In 2016, a proposal to cancel all uses of imidacloprid was shared with the public, based on various data, including from academics. This consultation generated numerous comments and new information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761591"> In 2017, a multi-stakeholder forum was created to address data gaps and gather new water-monitoring data. Since then, substantial water-monitoring data and new scientific papers were reviewed to inform the PMRA's final decision. The analysis showed that, with additional protective measures, some uses could continue safely, while others would be cancelled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8761592"> The PMRA continues its efforts to communicate its decision transparently and accessibly, ensuring Canadians are informed about pesticide safety. It works closely with the science advisory committee on pest control products to ensure independent scientific advice supports evidence-based decisions, enhances transparency, communicates the science behind decisions and informs a rigorous approach. </ParaText>
