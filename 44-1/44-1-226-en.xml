              <ParaText id="7932503">He said: Madam Speaker, I was saddened today to see the lineups in Quebec City. It is unprecedented. This morning, Quebeckers are waiting in line for food because they can no longer pay their bills. Groceries are expensive. The cost of food has skyrocketed by more than 20% in the last two years, and that increase corresponds almost perfectly to the carbon tax imposed in the country. Obviously, if the government imposes a tax on the gasoline or diesel used by farmers who produce our food and the truckers who deliver it, it becomes a tax on everyone who buys the food. Unfortunately, more and more Canadians can no longer afford to buy their own food. A report published the food banks association two or three days ago indicates that 1.5 million Canadians depend on food banks to eat. A full 7 million Canadians are currently not eating enough because of the cost. That is the reality after eight years of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932504">What is the Bloc Québécois doing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932505">Not only did the Bloc Québécois support the Liberal Prime Minister's inflationary policies, it also wants to radically increase the carbon tax. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278648" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> said in the House, “Madam Speaker, the carbon tax is a very good measure. However, it needs to be increased far more drastically than it has been so far.” That shows just how out of touch the Bloc Québécois is with ordinary people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932506">The <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the Bloc Québécois is trying to distance himself from his own position. A few days ago, he appeared on the TVA network and suddenly forgot he had supported the carbon tax. He said that the tax did not apply to Quebec, but that is not true. The second carbon tax does apply to Quebec. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, it will add 17 cents to the price of a litre of gas. With the sales tax applied on top of the carbon tax, the total increase will amount to 20 cents a litre. For that reason I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278426" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932507">The Bloc Québécois voted against a motion to eliminate this second carbon tax and allow Quebeckers to keep their own money, and the leader of the Bloc Québécois forgot that too. He said that he never voted on the second carbon tax, but the June 5 record of the House of Commons debates says otherwise. Either he forgot or he wants Quebeckers to forget. We have not forgotten. I remember that he voted for the second carbon tax. I also remember that the Bloc Québécois wants to radically increase taxes at Quebeckers' expense. Quebeckers should not have to send their money to Ottawa. Why would a supposedly sovereignist party want to give Quebeckers' money to Ottawa and hand it over to federal politicians and bureaucrats?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932508">I believe that Quebeckers should be masters of their own house and masters of their own money. That is why I am going to eliminate the carbon tax. Voting for the Bloc Québécois is costly. It is very costly. We will make sure no one forgets that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932509">The Bloc Québécois leader is also trying to forget something else he did to attack the values of Quebeckers in the regions. His own member supported amendments to Bill C‑21 to ban a 300-page-long list of hunting weapons. The Liberals presented the committee with a 300-page list of hunting weapons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932512">This means that he may have wanted to ban more hunting rifles. Contrary to what the Bloc Québécois with its far left ideology thinks, hunters in the regions of Quebec are not criminals. Hunters have the right to continue keeping their heritage alive and to do so respectfully, without being attacked by the government. That is why the Conservative Party is the only party in the House of Commons that will stand up for hunters in Quebec and across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932513">Speaking of hunting, because food is so expensive, hunting has become more than just a recreational activity for many communities. People are hunting to feed themselves. After paying their bills, people cannot even afford to feed themselves, so they have to be able to hunt. It is necessary to their survival as human beings. The only party that stands up for hunters in the House of Commons is the Conservative Party.</ParaText>

This is the misery that has unfolded after eight years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inflationary deficits and carbon taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932515">It is worse. Now the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, with the necessary help of the NDP, plans to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre. When one taxes the gas and diesel of the farmer who makes the food and the trucker who ships the food, one taxes all who buy the food. No wonder people cannot afford groceries. The NDP-Liberal government is taxing those groceries and now, terrifyingly, plans to quadruple that tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932516">Amazingly, members of the Atlantic caucus of the Liberal Party are now saying the opposite in their ridings to what they are doing on Parliament Hill. They have voted 23 times to hike the carbon tax when they are here, but then when they go back to Atlantic Canada, they say they are against the carbon tax. The people of Atlantic Canada are smarter than that. They are not going to be fooled by politicians who say one thing in the Atlantic and say the exact opposite when they are on Parliament Hill. They will realize. This is a very simple principle: If the Atlantic Liberal MPs do not vote for Atlantic Canadians in the House of Commons, then Atlantic Canadians will not vote for Liberals at election time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932517">Atlantic Canadians know there is only one party that will axe the carbon tax, that only one party has stood up and fought this tax every step of the way. Over the weekend, we will make sure Atlantic Canadians are aware their MPs will be voting on Tuesday on whether to quadruple the tax to 61¢ a litre or axe the tax. That is the choice, and all the constituents in their ridings will be watching carefully. We will make sure it does not slip by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932518">As well, we will make sure all the constituents of the NDP, which has sold out working-class people in favour of big government and big corporations, know the NDP is busy picking their pockets and is serving government greed in Ottawa rather than the interests of hard-working Canadians and seniors across our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932549">Our Bloc Québécois friends may be having fun, but Quebeckers are realizing that they would perhaps do well to listen to what the Conservative Party is proposing. I would remind my colleagues that, this morning in Quebec City, in the Bloc riding of Beauport—Limoilou, there was a long lineup at Bouchée généreuse, a food bank. A journalist came by and recorded a video. He said that he could not get over the fact that in Quebec City there are so many people lining up to get help in order to eat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932550">I would also remind my friends in the Bloc Québécois and in the Liberal Party that according to this week's news, Quebeckers have been the hardest hit by inflation. In Quebec, inflation has gone up by 14.9% since February 2021, while the average pay has risen by only 9.8%. This suggests that we have collectively gotten that much poorer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932551">Also this morning, an article in the Journal de Montréal and the Journal de Québec reported that Quebeckers have slipped into financial insecurity. According to a poll, 65% of young people say that they are unable to pay all their bills without going further into debt. The reality of inflation has caught up with young people: 51% are living paycheque to paycheque and life's simple pleasures are out of reach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932556">Madam Speaker, when we talk about the carbon tax, our Bloc Québécois friends like to say that it does not apply in Quebec. They need to understand that the federal carbon tax, which does apply to provinces other than Quebec, has a direct impact on consumption in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932557">We only have to think of the Alberta farmer who is taxed to grow the food, the trucker who transports it and has to pay a tax, the store that sells the food and the family who buys it. It is a chain. At the end of that chain, the taxes that have been imposed on producers elsewhere in Canada, including the carbon tax, have a direct impact on consumer prices for Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932558">This tax was created by the Liberal Party, which decided it was the best thing in the world. They insisted on it and imposed it on Canadians, and the Bloc Québécois unfortunately supported that. It is easy enough for the Bloc Québécois to say that Quebeckers have their own tax, the carbon exchange, and that the carbon tax does not impact them. However, as I just said, there is a direct—not indirect—impact on consumer products in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932559">What we are doing today is not complicated. We are asking the government to give Quebeckers and Canadians some breathing room, to give them a break. The ending of our motion is straightforward. It asks that “the House call on the government to introduce legislation, within seven days of this motion being adopted, to repeal all carbon taxes to bring home lower prices on gas, groceries, and home heating.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932560">We are actually not attacking the Bloc Québécois. We are asking the Bloc Québécois to show some sense, to understand that people are suffering and that it is expensive. The articles that I read at the start of my speech were not pulled out of thin air, nor were they made up by the Conservative Party. They are reporting facts, things that are happening right now. The Bloc members here in Ottawa, in what they like to call their foreign Parliament, do not understand that reality is different for ordinary people. As I said, there are people in Beauport—Limoilou who are lining up this morning to be able to eat. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932561">I am asking the Bloc Québécois members to think logically. Can they understand that we need to find ways to bring down consumer prices and make it possible for people to keep more of their money? There is already so much taken from their pay in taxes and, on top of that, all consumer goods are getting more expensive. The cost increase is appalling. By eliminating taxes, we will be able to lend a hand to the industry by making things easier for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932562">I will not blame all 32 Bloc Québécois members. I have spoken with some of them, so I know that there are some who can reason, who think logically, who understand. However, there are others who come into the House and just throw words around. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278648" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> said, “Madam Speaker, the carbon tax is a very good measure. However, it needs to be increased far more drastically than it has been so far.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932563">This means that, even though it costs a lot, he believes it is still not enough. His party wants to increase the tax even though it will cost even more. It does not matter if the price of carrots doubles. They do not care. They just want to increase the tax. This is the request from one Bloc Québécois member. We want to know whether the 31 other Bloc members and the leader of the Bloc Québécois agree with this request. Does the leader of the Bloc agree that we should increase a tax that is already too high and that should not exist in the first place? It is not clear, because we have never heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="278648" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation>'s colleagues tell him to calm down or say that he is going too far, that he needs to stop and that people are already paying enough. No, they seem to think that what he is saying makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932564">Let me clarify something that the Bloc members do not seem to understand. The motion also explains that the Bloc Québécois supported the creation of a second carbon tax, which does apply to Quebec. I am referring to the infamous clean fuel regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932565">We know that there was no vote on this. These regulations were put in place by the government, so there was no vote. However, in June, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> tabled a motion that specifically called for the cancellation of the carbon tax and the regulations. What did the Bloc Québécois do? It voted against the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932566">As a result, this regulation has been in force since July 1, so now there is a tax, applied through the regulations, that will make gas more expensive. The Parliamentary Budget Officer demonstrated this in a report that I am not allowed to show to the House, but I have it here. In his report, the Parliamentary Budget Officer demonstrates that Quebeckers, yes, Quebeckers, will be taxed directly under these regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932567">The Bloc Québécois will say that it is not a tax, it is regulations, but that is just semantics. When people pay, when they take out their credit card to pay for gas, it is a tax. For us, it is a tax. For the public, it is a tax. No matter what it is called, the fact remains that when regulations are in effect and make people pay, it is a tax.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Relative to household disposable income, PBO results show that the Clean Fuel Regulations are broadly regressive.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932570">Environment and Climate Change Canada even estimates that the clean fuel regulations will increase the price of gasoline and diesel in 2030, the year in which the regulations reach full stringency, and will reduce Canada's real GDP by up to 0.3%, or $9 billion, in 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932571">While the Liberals and the Bloc Québécois always claim that they listen to the experts, they obviously have selective hearing because some experts are pointing out problems. Most importantly, they are not listening to Canadians, or to Quebeckers in the Bloc Québécois's case. If anyone is wondering why people are starting to ask questions, I just gave the answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932572">Sometimes, the Bloc Québécois can do good things. In its election platform, there is one good thing. The first point is obviously not so good because it is about achieving independence. That will not be achieved here, but in Quebec City. I invite the Bloc members to run for provincial office so they can try to achieve independence there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932573">Anyway, back to Ottawa. The Bloc Québécois states in its platform that it must be able to change. That is written in black and white. For the past two weeks, their new messaging has been that they are responsible people, that they are the adults in the House, even though they are yelling behind me. They say they can change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932574">I must admit that they showed they could change. To counter the effects of the legislation created by Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which allows criminals to serve their sentences at home, I introduced Bill <Document DbId="12269389" Type="4">C-325</Document>. The Bloc Québécois said they would support me because a mistake had indeed been made. The Bloc admitted that it was a problem.

              <ParaText id="7932596">The opposition is once again tabling a motion that it claims would help Canadians with household costs, but in actuality, it seeks to weaken our efforts on fighting climate change. I will take a few minutes now to explain why action on climate change is so essential, why carbon pollution pricing and clean fuel regulations are core to that action and how we have been able to act while protecting Canadians against affordability impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932597">This summer, as every member of the House knows, Canadians faced devastating wildfires across the country. We saw entire communities evacuated through the flames, and we now face costs to rebuild in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Scientists confirm, and Canadians understand, that these historic wildfires were made much more likely and far more intense because of climate change and that we will continue to face even more severe natural disasters in the future if we do not take serious action now and demonstrate leadership to reduce the carbon pollution that causes climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932598">I will quote a recent article from the Financial Post that leans in on the issue of how serious governments need to have more than one ambition and more than one commitment:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932599">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> [Carbon pricing] puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions [and it] is often accused of exacerbating rising food costs. This is a mistake. Addressing both food insecurity and climate change must be national priorities and to suggest that we can [improve] affordability if we sacrifice the environment is a dangerous error. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932600">That article and many others go on to explain how climate change is actually far more responsible for rising food costs than is a price on pollution, which is actually one of the solutions to fighting climate change and the intense weather we are experiencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932601">Our government understands the urgency of addressing climate change. We know that we need to act now and to act seriously. That is why, since 2016, our government has put in place a comprehensive suite of measures that help Canadians reduce carbon pollution and accelerate the adoption of new clean technologies. Canadians have asked us to take action, and we have delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932602">In fact, in the last election, every single member of this House ran on a commitment to price pollution and to price carbon. Erin O'Toole, as the leader of the Conservatives, ran on a commitment to have a carbon price. This means that every voter in Canada voted for some type of carbon pricing mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932603">At the heart of this action is an economic tool that economists and experts around the world recognize as one of the lowest-cost and most flexible options to address climate change. That is putting a price on carbon pollution. Economists and serious stewards of the economy know that markets are a powerful tool. They can create prosperities for innovation and solve problems by harnessing the decision-making power and knowledge of millions of households and businesses across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932604">Pricing carbon is a market-based instrument. It is actually at the core of Conservative thinking. Conservative governments across the world believe in these market-based instruments and using markets to influence such things as how much pollution a society can create. This is an example of a Conservative Party that is lost in space. It does not believe in climate change, and it does not believe in the simple math around fighting climate change with a market-based instrument such as a carbon price, despite the fact that all its members ran on one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932605">I would not be surprised if Conservative members did not even believe in gravity. Climate change is right in front of them. It is absurd to look at that in the face, particularly in the wake of the worst wildfire season our country has ever experienced, and deny its existence entirely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932606">Markets fight climate change, in large part, by using price signals. Any rare, expensive or desirable good has a higher price, and this spurs new businesses to enter markets, innovate and provide more of these goods and services to find lower-cost ways of delivering them. Putting a price on carbon works the exact same way. It sends a signal that polluting costs us all, encourages the market to create cleaner alternatives and encourages households and businesses to adopt these alternatives and pollute less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932607">We all pay when we flush the toilet in our homes. When we put our garbage out to get picked up on garbage day, we pay through our property taxes. What comes out of our tailpipes and the emissions created by heating our homes also have costs, and it is important to recognize that those costs actually have a value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932608">Provinces such as Quebec and British Columbia have been doing this for a long time. I know a lot of Quebec members have stood up and talked about carbon pricing. They have been benefiting from it, as Ontarians did until 2018, when Doug Ford cancelled cap and trade in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7932609">This is Economics 101, and the opposition should know better than to claim it does not work. They ran on a similar plan. If they were serious about addressing climate change, then they would know that real action requires significant investments and a carbon pollution price will encourage the most efficient and lowest-cost investments possible. Their constant demands to eliminate the price on carbon suggest that they do not understand how the economy works, they do not believe in serious action on climate change, or both. It could also be that they just need something for bumper stickers and T-shirts. I think that is probably the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932610">Let me now turn to affordability, which is top of mind for all of us these days. Canadians are facing higher prices because of rapid inflation, which has been driven by pandemic supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine and high housing costs because of long-standing shortages. I could stand for 20 minutes and talk about what we need to do in order to address housing costs, but today, we are talking about climate action. We know that governments across the world that take it seriously are taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932611">Our government is focused on an affordability plan across our mandate. Our $8.9-billion plan put in place multiple measures to make life more affordable: enhancing the Canada worker benefit, ensuring affordable child care and dental care, increasing the old age security pension and topping up the Canada housing benefit. This is just to name a few things that the Conservatives consistently voted against. We have continued to work to address the issues that cause affordability impacts by taking action this summer; for example, he have worked to lower the costs of new rental housing and hold grocery store chains to account by managing price increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932612">Affordability is baked into our approach on climate change too, and pricing pollution is just the same. First, let us be clear: Carbon pricing is not about raising government revenues, as the opposition has consistently implied. The enabling federal legislation, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, mandates that every cent of proceeds from the federal system is returned to the province or territory of origin. Jurisdictions that requested the federal system have the option to receive those proceeds directly and use them as they see fit. Nunavut and Yukon did just that with the federal fuel charge. They are using the proceeds to reduce affordability impacts on households and fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932613">In other jurisdictions, the federal government returns these proceeds directly to Canadians. For the fuel charge, this means that Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces all receive a climate action incentive rebate four times a year. Ninety per cent of fuel charge proceeds in these provinces are returned via climate action incentive payments delivered directly to households, something that the Conservatives ignore entirely. These are set amounts based on the number of people in the household, with a 10% top-up for rural households.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932614"> Over eight out of 10 households receive more money back than the carbon price will cost them in a given year. It is worth pointing out that this 80% is made up of the 80% of households that need it the most. The wealthiest Canadians tend to use more heat, have larger homes, drive less fuel-efficient vehicles and maybe heat more than one home, such as a cottage. There is nothing wrong with that, but the fact is that when one uses more fossil fuels, one ought to pay for the emissions. There are average amounts for lower- and middle-income households, and they particularly benefit. A typical family of four in Ontario received $976 in 2022, and they will receive more this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932615">I am often asked about how this is supposed to work. Why collect a carbon price and then return all the money back to households? How can this change behaviour and spur on innovation? The key is the way we return the proceeds. Because the payment is the same for all households, Canadians still get a benefit from reducing pollution, for example, in choosing a cleaner vehicle, switching to a heat pump to heat their home, or insulating their home through one of our many green housing grants. They get the same payment regardless, and they come out ahead. However, the climate action incentive payment reduces the impact on their pocketbook if they cannot make a change right away. Households that do not have short-term options to reduce pollution, such as those where someone just bought a new car or cannot find an insulation contractor, do not see an impact on their finances overall. The incentive payment cancels out most or all of the carbon price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932616">This approach gives Canadians the flexibility to address climate change when it makes sense for their particular situation. Moreover, it complements the many other measures we have put in place to help Canadians transition to a cleaner economy affordably, such as a $500-million program to support the move to home heat pumps rather than dirty and expensive home heating oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932617">There is a lot to talk about today. The clean fuel regulations are another powerful market-based tool for climate action that the opposition is firmly against. I would point out that, since we are focusing on affordability, the number one cost driver of food, particularly vegetables grown in drought-prone places such as California, is climate change. When we resist the need to fight climate change, we are resigning ourselves to more expensive food from places like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932618">I will go back to the clean fuel regulations for just a minute. This is another part of Canada's action plan, which is expected to deliver another 26.6-million tonnes of emissions reductions annually by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932619">Our plan to reduce emissions and ensure affordability is working. The Conservatives should stop standing against climate action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932634">I agree that when Doug Ford decided to cancel the cap and trade, which created billions in revenues for the Province of Ontario to fund health care, green initiatives and education, it left Ontarians in the lurch. However, the federal backstop program delivers the proceeds from the carbon levy in Ontario directly back to Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932635">It is very much worth pointing out that the Conservatives are exactly the same as the Doug Ford government. They will not say that we need to fight climate change and lower our emissions. They will put up billboards, as Doug Ford has done around Ontario, saying the future is electric, but when it comes to actually implementing policies, having good ideas, discussing with experts on how to fight climate change and how a carbon price does that, they do not show up at those meetings. They are not willing to have those conversations, and they do not ask experts; they rely on bumper stickers and T-shirts for all their policies.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7932640">Madam Speaker, today is a really important day because, if there is anything I can say after reading the text of the motion, is that it lays bare something that we have seen throughout the debates of the House, which is that the Conservatives do not care about climate action. They do not take climate action seriously, and that is deeply troubling after the summer we have seen in this country, with wildfires and hurricanes, and the impacts they have had on individuals right across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932641">What some people may find surprising, and I appreciate the opportunity to show again, is that it leaves bare that the Conservatives do not have an economic strategy to build a strong Canadian economy for the future. That is what Canadians are looking to us for. They want to make sure that we are building an economy where there are strong, good-paying jobs for the future, which, when we look at what the Conservatives are asking for from us today, is something they are unable to deliver on. In fact, they are trying to take things apart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932642">We have a choice as a country. We can stay locked in our old ways, keep our heads in the ground and not look at where the future lies, or we can move to the future. The world is in a global change toward green technologies, a green economy and clean energy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932643">The questions I would have for the Conservatives as we go forward are these: Are they going to follow the Blockbuster method? How is VHS working for them? That is where they are trying to take Canadians back to. To be serious about this, because this is serious, Canadians want to have those opportunities, such as good-paying jobs and strong, safe communities. Dismantling tools to fight climate change just moves us in the wrong direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932644">Climate change is putting homes, farms and businesses at risk from increasing natural disasters, which has a cost, and I will touch on that a bit, but the other piece is that not taking action on climate change also impacts trade and investments in our country, which would impact the average Canadian who needs to know that we are there with a strong plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932645">The other question I have, beyond the question about VHS, is this: Why do the Conservatives not trust Canadians to make the best decisions by being able to keep money in their own pockets? In the next couple of weeks, Canadians will be receiving cheques or direct deposits as part of the carbon pricing plan in the federal backstop provinces, which is the underpinning for how carbon pricing works in their country. It is putting money into their pockets to let them choose what they are going to do with that money. That means they could carry on as they did before and spend that money on it, or they may be able to use that money to make some changes in how they are going to do things, such as letting themselves keep more money in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932646">It should not come as a surprise to us that the Conservatives do not want Canadians to keep more money in their own pockets because there is another piece they did not support. As of this year, Canadians will have $3,000 more of tax-free earnings when they file their taxes this year than in 2019. In 2019, the average Canadian's personal exemption would have been around $12,000. This year it is $15,000. That is $3,000 more in the pockets of Canadians. They get to choose how to use that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932647">I am not sure why the Conservatives are opposed to these measures. They are the kinds of things that, when I talk to people in my community, they want to see. They want to be able to make their own decisions with their money. Not only that, they want more tax-free money and want us to act on climate change, so I am a bit surprised when I see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932648">It is really important that we talk about how carbon pricing is efficient. That is something that is recognized by leaders in economic thinking. Perhaps the Conservatives do not want to take my word for it, so let us look at what The World Bank said about a price on carbon pollution. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932651">I want to underline that it “stimulates clean technology and market innovation, fuelling new, low-carbon drivers of economic growth”. I think that is what Canadians are looking for from us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932652">Let us look at what the OECD had to say about it when it was reviewing the Canadian carbon pricing system. It said, “The carbon pricing benchmark provides an economically efficient mechanism for raising the bar on emission reduction.” “Economically efficient” sounds like what Canadians are looking for from us. I would question why the Conservatives seem to be so opposed to a system that would be economically efficient, fuel economic growth and actually help to build a strong economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932653">An economist from the University of Calgary commented on this and said that, while regulations would dictate what one must do to cut back on fossil fuel use, carbon prices leave it to a consumer or a business to decide what works best for them. He said that to let the person or business decide what is best for them makes it the most efficient way, and usually the cheaper way, to address carbon emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932654">It is a personal choice and it is a cheaper way to address carbon emissions. That sounds to me like a win-win, but Conservatives seem to be opposed to that, so I will have to leave it with them to figure out why they feel so strongly. Canadians want that efficiency. They want us to stimulate clean technology and market innovation. They want a solid economy that is creating good-paying jobs. They want to be able to make decisions with their own money.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932665">Madam Speaker, I thought I outlined in quite a bit of detail why carbon pricing works as a system. We recognize people have been struggling with the high costs of inflation, but the carbon price is not the reason. In fact, the Bank of Canada said that the contribution of the carbon price to inflation was 0.15%. That is not even half a per cent; it is not even a quarter per cent. It is 0.15%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932666">Absolutely, we must be helping Canadians in this difficult time. When I mention things such as the fact that they can keep $3,000 more of their earnings this year through an increased personal exemption, which the Conservatives did not support, those types of measures are what we are doing to help Canadians. This is along with the Canada child benefit, which is indexed to inflation, as well as child care agreements for $10-a-day child care. We are there to support Canadians. We recognize they need that support, but getting rid of carbon pricing is not going to help Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932678">Next, I want to quickly thank our Conservative friends. They have given us an amazing opportunity to expose their battle tactics. In my view, they have given us this opportunity far too early, to their own disadvantage. These tactics could prove to be their undoing. In summary, their strategy is to say the opposite of the truth or, to put it more bluntly, to lie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932679">The example of the firearms bill made that quite clear.

To say otherwise would be a crude and vulgar lie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932680">The example of the emissions regulations is another good joke. We do not get to vote on regulations. Let everyone take note. However, true to form, relying on rather old-fashioned tactics, the Conservatives have cobbled together a motion containing one point and a whole lot of vitriol. Now they are saying that if we do not want the point, we have to swallow the vitriol. Obviously, we vote against these kinds of Conservative motions. That is the natural reflex of an intelligent person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932681">The carbon tax does not apply to Quebec. I am almost tempted to say it in English, so there will be a small chance that three people or so will understand me. The carbon tax does not apply to Quebec. Quebec has a carbon exchange. It is a cap-and-trade system that was negotiated by successive ministers of the environment. The minister of the environment who was in office when the system was introduced in 2013 is someone I know well. It is me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932682">I just want the Conservatives to know that their attack ads are not working on Quebeckers. They can make all the dumb little jokes they want and buy ad spots on television because their coffers are full, but it is not working on Quebeckers. The Conservatives do not realize it. What do they know about Quebec? They held a convention in Quebec City where they somehow managed to avoid talking about Quebec and adopted proposals that run counter to what Quebeckers want. The Conservative leader comes to Quebec once a year, but he wants people to think that he has a second home there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932683">It was a tactical error to do this so early and to tell these lies so early. I have a whole year to debunk these lies, expose these tactics and show that the Conservative leader is not worthy of Quebeckers' trust, whether he becomes prime minister or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932684">Canadians are caught between a rock and a hard place. They are caught between right-wing activists and proponents of fake left-wing individualism. They are caught between the Conservatives and the Liberals. However, that is not the case in Quebec. In Quebec, Quebeckers have the Bloc Québécois. They may even have the balance of power without any risk. We vote for what is good for Quebec, whether it comes from the Conservatives or the Liberals. We vote against what is bad for Quebec. In the meantime, we try to improve what is presented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932685">Let us look at the contents of the latest narrow-minded Conservative propaganda motion. First, as I was saying, the Bloc Québécois did not support anything because we do not vote to pass regulations. As usual, the Conservatives cooked up a motion today to try to trick the House. We will vote against the motion again today because it is bad for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932686">Still, the Conservative leader has done us a favour. I am pleased because, in between buying a tight T-shirt and a pair of Ray-Bans, by attacking us, he is admitting that it is the Bloc Québécois that will prevent any party from having a majority in the House, as it did in 2019 and 2021.</ParaText>

The plight of seniors is concerning, or at least it is to us. However, none of that is because of the carbon tax in Quebec. It does not apply in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932689">There is a question I often want to ask the Conservatives. I want to know what their issue is with the truth. I will explain why things are so expensive. I will explain why the Conservative leader's wacky idea of imposing partisan Conservative rule on the central bank is a ridiculous idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932690">Here is a number: $200 billion. That is how much the oil companies made in profits in 2022. I repeat: $200 billion. There are 11 zeros in that number. In Canada, there are 40 million people, including Quebeckers. Let us do the math. Let us remove seven zeros from the $200 billion. That adds up to $5,000 per capita in profits for the oil companies. That includes babies, seniors, everyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932691">The Conservatives claim that fighting climate change is increasing the cost of living. That is false. It is big oil's despicable profits that are increasing the cost of living. That is $200 billion in 2022 alone, on the backs of farmers, seniors, truck drivers, families. They need to stop with the lies. They are just knock-off lobbyists for big oil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932692">The Liberals are no better. There is one group that lies and another that covers up, and the oil companies are profiting from the $200 billion in generous subsidies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932693">Neither one of these parties is working for the environment. Neither one of these parties is working for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932694">The Bloc Québécois will continue to work in good faith to keep Parliament running, even though some members are in campaign mode. We will continue to fight against inflation in a responsible and clean way. We will not put up with lies or deceit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932714">Madam Speaker, everyone must do more at all times to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the temptation to shift this responsibility to individuals is potentially rather regrettable because it removes some of the responsibility from those who are the biggest emitters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932717">Madam Speaker, it is hard to speak after someone so eloquent. I will do my best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932718">I feel that, with this motion, the Conservative Party has gone from what we knew about them, the populism of constantly presenting us with very simplistic solutions to complex problems, to trickery. Trickery that is crass and abhorrent deceit. It is hypocritical, devious. That is what I see in the motion by the Conservative Party</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932719">Indeed, comparing efforts to fight climate change and the rising cost of living is irresponsible. I am sure that people will agree with me. I wonder if that irresponsibility is what the Conservatives call “common sense”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932720">I will say it again, and I will not come back to it. I will reiterate what my leader said. There is no carbon tax in Quebec. Quebec has its own carbon pricing, the carbon exchange. The second tax the Conservatives are referring to is a clean fuel regulation on which no one voted, but that they had previously proposed themselves. I will come back to that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932721">I have repeatedly heard the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> say that Canada is broken. When I read his motion this morning, I see that the only thing that is broken is the Leader of the Opposition's value system. I have also heard him say, with respect to the cost of living, that people are requesting medical assistance in dying because they have nothing to eat. I have never heard anything so irresponsible in my life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932722">This summer, my mother-in-law passed away. She requested medical assistance in dying. Whenever anyone in that situation hears absurdities like that, they see the Conservative Party's true colours. I would say there is a love affair between the Conservatives and the oil industry, a bit like the Bloc Québécois and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932723">The worst deception before us today is the use of the rising cost of living and the plight of the must vulnerable to advance oil company projects. I do not think we have ever seen anything so indecent in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932724">In my view, the leader of the official opposition is driven by fear. I have the feeling that the leader of the official opposition is afraid that our dependence on oil and gas in Canada and Quebec will come to an end. I think that the leader of the official opposition is afraid of the end of oil in the same way that we in the Bloc Québécois are afraid of the demise of Quebec's culture, language and unique lifestyle. Our project is Quebec. His project is oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932725">Let us review the facts. Again this week, we saw Conservative members burst into applause at the mention of new oil projects. That happens a lot. When we talk about oil in the House, they clearly lose their heads. When I first arrived here in 2019, I was surprised to hear shouts of “build the pipeline”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932726">Not only that, but I have previously seen a motion from the Conservative Party stating that oil is irreplaceable. The only thing that I see as being irreplaceable is air, water, and the relationship that I have with my son and my wife. It is certainly not oil. For a Conservative, oil is irreplaceable. The Conservatives even have buttons that say, “I love oil”. At this point, it is an all-consuming passion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932727">The Conservatives are in favour of all investment tax credits for the oil and gas sector. That is $82 billion. We will not hear a Conservative say that we need to tighten public finances and reduce subsidies for fossil fuels. We will never hear that. As the Conservative leader said, 2022 is a record year. The big oil companies made $200 billion in profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932728">The opposition leader made an appearance in Québec City. I will read a thoroughly unpleasant quote. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would not throw billions of dollars at “projects that are mismanaged by incompetent politicians”. He actually said that to Quebeckers when he talked about strategic projects for public transit. However, I have never heard him say a single word about a Canadian project worth over $30 billion that is nothing short of a disaster, does not serve us in Quebec and will continue to exacerbate the climate crisis. I have never heard him say a single word about Trans Mountain.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7932729">Let us be clear, the leader of the official opposition is not thinking about the next generation, he is thinking about the next election. The leader of the official opposition is not thinking of the poor, he is thinking of the wealthy, the big oil companies that are raking in billions of dollars. He is thinking about the greedy people living off fossil fuel subsidies. These are not empty words. I have hard evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932730">The duplicity does not end there. In 2011, the Conservative government did exactly what the Conservative Party is accusing the Liberal government of doing. What they are criticizing us for, as though we were in government, is Harper’s renewable fuels regulations. Who was in government then? The leader of the official opposition and former leader Erin O’Toole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932731">I will quote Mr. O’Toole. I love this quote. I read it at night before going to bed: “We recognize that the most efficient way to reduce our emissions is to use pricing mechanisms.” The former Conservative leader wanted to put a price on carbon. That is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932732">Not long ago, last week, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278366" Type="2">Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis</Affiliation> started waving an invoice that she wanted to bring to the table. I invite her to table it. It is an invoice that, in her opinion, shows that there was a carbon tax in Quebec. If we look more closely at that invoice, however, what does it refer to? It refers to Quebec’s emissions cap-and-trade system. The member was criticizing a Quebec pricing mechanism in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932733">The idiocy does not end there. There is more. Where was the member for Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis from 2008 to 2018? She was in Quebec City; she was a minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932734">At that time, in 2015, what did Premier Philippe Couillard say on the floor of the Quebec National Assembly? He said, “And the beauty of the carbon market is that it can also generate revenues that are directly linked to climate change.” I can imagine the member right behind him cheering and clapping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932735">In 2012, Premier Jean Charest, who almost became the Conservative leader, said, “Quebec was the first jurisdiction in North America to introduce a carbon levy, with a program that was applauded by environmental groups while also being very good for the sector and producing $200 million per year.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932736">Jean Charest was talking proudly about putting a price on carbon. Where was the member? She was right behind him, cheering. Now she is in the House of Commons waving around an energy bill mentioning that there is a price on carbon in Quebec and accusing the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party of Canada of bringing in this tax while she was a provincial minister in Quebec. Is that not deceitful?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932737">Earlier, I contrasted our interest in Quebec with the Conservatives' interest in the oil industry. It made me think of a poem by Gérald Godin. He wrote a fantastic poem commenting on the turpitude and deceit of some politicians who were not standing up for Quebec. The poem ended by saying that some politicians will have “a grease stain on their conscience”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932738">That made me think about my Conservative colleagues, particularly those from Quebec. In 20 or 30 years, when their grandchildren ask them what they did to fight against climate change when they were MPs and how they acted, the only thing the Conservative members will be able to say is that they defended the interests of oil companies. They will have to say that they did nothing and that they defended the interests of oil companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932739">My colleagues from Quebec are not going to have a grease stain on their conscience. They are going to have a great big oil stain.</ParaText>

Earlier, the leader clearly stated that Quebec was no more virtuous than anyone else. We have renewable energies, and we put them to good use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932754">We need to review Canada's industrial landscape and stop subsidizing fossil fuels. We could develop wind and solar energy, as the United States is doing. Unfortunately, Canada is very far behind. The government is trying to invest in carbon capture strategies that will never work and trying to produce net-zero oil. It is sheer idiocy. We need to put an end to these pipe dreams and ask ourselves some tough questions about the energy transition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932756">I am tired of constantly talking about the carbon tax. I have reached my limit. The Conservatives have circled back to this nonsense five times in one year. That is just for one year and I am tired of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932757">It is Groundhog Day all over again. They keep at it again and again, with the same old Conservative pro-oil, pro-fossil fuel rhetoric that flies in the face of science, the IPCC, the United Nations and even things that are happening in the Conservatives' own ridings. At some point, this kind of wilful blindness and denialism becomes frightening. It means we are going to keep right on polluting and, because polluting should be free. We are setting a bad example to the world, when average Canadians are already among the world's worst polluters per capita. Based on Canada's per capita greenhouse gas emissions, we are the world's second leading polluter. Fortunately, Canada is not as big as China or the planet would already be screwed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932758">We have to make a considerable effort to protect our environment, our children, future generations and to create good jobs for the future and sustainable jobs with sustainable energy. The Conservatives are living 50 or 60 years in the past, when we thought there would be no consequences to polluting so much and emitting so much carbon in the atmosphere, but now we know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932759">We not only know, but it has been proven and we are seeing it. The impact of climate change, climate disturbances and climate chaos can already been seen here at home and around the world. It is happening faster than predicted, more dramatically than predicted. Every three months, scientists tell us that they thought this was coming, but that it is going to be more serious more quickly and everywhere. No one will be spared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932760">We saw that this summer with forest fires like we have never seen in Quebec and in Canada. Here in Ottawa and Montreal, it smelled like smoke. There was smoke everywhere. Then there were the people in British Columbia and in Abitibi and on the North Shore who were forced to evacuate because they were risking their lives. Their homes could catch fire. That is where we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932761">Because of climate change, some places are not getting enough rain, while others are getting far too much. The temperature is rising. There are more, bigger and more dangerous fires and wildfires. Other areas are being affected by flooding. I think it was in 2022 in Pakistan. At one point, a third of the country was under water. Millions of people were displaced to save their lives. We saw it again this summer in many places, such as Greece, Italy and just recently Libya. It rained so heavily in such a short period that a dam broke. Part of the city of Derna was completely devastated. Thousands of people were killed, and that sort of thing is going to start happening more and more often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932762">If we listen to the Conservatives, we will hit a brick wall and keep pressing on the gas. Their plan is to do nothing. There are small measures that might help a little, like the carbon tax. The carbon tax is not a panacea. I am not saying that it will solve the problem, but they do not even want to do that. They are so out of touch with reality that they are ideologically blocked and unable to look anywhere else. They are wearing blinders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932763">There are parts of the planet, entire areas, that are going to become uninhabitable. If the average temperature rises to 35°C and the humidity is greater than 90%, the human body cannot cool itself down.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932764">This causes extreme heatstroke leading to death, as the organs cannot survive. This will happen with greater frequency around the equator, whether in North Africa, Asia or Central America. Global warming is also causing accelerated evaporation of the oceans, which will make it more humid. What will people do when it reaches over 35° on a regular basis with extremely high humidity? They are going to move. They are not going to stay where they are. There will be a massive influx of climate refugees. We cannot be angry with them, since, where they live, it will literally become uninhabitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932765">I asked a question last year to the Department of Immigration and the department of housing to find out what the federal government's plan is for receiving climate refugees. I was told that programs already exist. In fact, there is no plan, and yet we are already seeing a greater influx of refugees at the border. I recall that Roxham Road made the headlines in a somewhat populist way. People are increasingly going to be moving around on the planet and that will have consequences. I am saying this so that it is clear: The current Liberal government has no plan. I just want to mention that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932766">People will be on the move not only because they are too hot, but also because they are hungry. In a recent article in The Guardian, Cary Fowler, U.S. President Joe Biden's special envoy for food security, said there is every reason to believe that a global food shortage will take hold by 2050. As we have seen, problems are already happening because of certain conflicts. The war in Ukraine is impacting the wheat supply of many countries. However, the magnitude of the food shortage in question will be far greater and will persist in regions of the world where growing grains, fruit and vegetables becomes difficult. These consequences are very real, and the Conservatives seem determined not to see them. The current federal government, the Liberals, also have a responsibility, but they are clearly not doing enough. They tend to want to have it both ways</ParaText>

That will require far more ambitious efforts to reduce emissions right now while ramping up investments in clean energy.... That is why it is time to do what a majority of Canadians, including in Alberta, believe is necessary, which is to put a hard cap on emissions from the Canadian oil and gas sector. ...any company or jurisdiction with net-zero emissions targets cannot continue to build or invest in new sources of fossil fuels. Companies cannot put off actually reducing their emissions by buying carbon credits. Also, they cannot lobby against climate action behind the scenes while claiming to be climate champions. Any progress made regarding net-zero emissions must be made public and independently verified.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="7932769">That quote was from Catherine McKenna, former Liberal minister of environment and climate change. She wrote an op-ed in La Presse yesterday to tell us that the time to act is now. Unfortunately, despite the promises by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278609" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>, despite the commitments made by his government to put a hard cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector, there is still nothing on the table as of September 2023. We are still waiting for the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> to introduce a measure that was supposed to have been in place months ago. The oil and gas sector is responsible for 30% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and its emissions are increasing. It has the worst record of all industrial sectors in the country by far. Without strong action, nothing will change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932770">Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, sadly. Looking at the curve between 2005 and 2021, we can see that they are increasing. It is unfortunate that my time is up, because I had a lot left to say.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932774">I wanted to make an important point. Canada is a laughingstock right now. Successive Conservative and Liberal governments have not been able to turn things around. The Paris Agreement tells us that in order to avoid catastrophe and keep the planet livable, we must not exceed 1.5°C of global average temperature increase by the end of the century. We are already at 1.3°C, I think, so there is very little room to manoeuvre left. On top of that, even if countries meet their current commitments—if they meet them, which they have not—we are heading towards 2.4°C. At 2.4°C, we will have the catastrophic scenarios I mentioned earlier.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932788"> I am going to read from the people of the State of California, attorney general versus ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, American Petroleum Institute and BP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932789">In 1988, Shell, along with all the other big oil companies, did major scientific studies of the dangers of fossil fuel burning. In that report to Shell executives, they warned that the drive of CO2 buildup was going to have “significant changes in sea level, ocean currents, precipitation patterns, regional temperature and weather.” However, they said something even more concerning. They said, “by the time the global warming becomes detectable”, which they said in 2000, “ it could be too late to take effective countermeasures.” They knew they were burning the planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932790"> What did Shell do? The next year, Shell raised the drilling platforms in the ocean by six feet. It was saying to hell with the people who were living on islands in the Pacific and the hundreds of millions of people on shorelines. It knew it was burning the planet. It knew the ice caps were melting. It was damned sure it would get every last dime before the planet was done. To make that possible, it had to use an elaborate system of disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932791">As such, today, once again, we have the Conservatives bringing forward this constant disinformation, but it is not even smart disinformation. It is distilled down to this dumb meme they are going to send out as their attack ads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932792">Yesterday, we were told that the leader of the Conservative Party apparently had a paper route. He has no other job history, but he had a paper route at one time. In June, I remember him saying that he was going to keep speaking until the government dropped the budget and got rid of dental and child benefits. He spoke for three hours to his rapturous backbench, and then even it got bored and the budget passed. Therefore, he needed a new stunt, because with the Conservatives it is always about stunts, spin, smear and smoke and mirrors, and smoke from fires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932793">The Conservative leader announced, in the hottest summer in the history of the planet, that he was going to go from coast to coast to coast to pitch the idea that burning fossil fuels should be free, saying to hell with the 14 million hectares of forest lands that burned this year, the 200,000 Canadians displaced and the communities that lived in fear. When he came to my region, people were trying to escape the fire by canoe, because we could not get Hercules planes up there. He was promising that not only was he going to expand pipelines everywhere, but that fossil fuel burning was going to be free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932794">However, it did not work out so well for him, because even he had to flee the fires. However, it did not stop the Conservatives with their sock puppets of disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932795">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278535" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>, as her community was burning, was going on about making fossil fuel burning free, showing disconnect and disinterest in keeping people safe, and not recognizing that there was a direct link between fossil fuel burning and the destruction of our environment. The member for Kelowna—Lake Country would rather promote the sock puppet messages from the Conservative war room than protect her own people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932796">I mention the member for <Affiliation DbId="278535" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>, because just recently the West Kelowna fire chief, Jason Brolund, spoke at the United Nations. This is what leadership is. He said that climate change became very real for West Kelowna, that the scope and scale for them to fight was nearly impossible to be successful again, that because of the changing climate leading to conditions, it was making it easier for fires to burn and grow. He asked a simple question. He wanted to know why we were spending money on fighting fires when we should be spending money on dealing with climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932797">However, we would not hear that from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278535" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>, because she is a loyal sock puppet of disinformation for the Conservative Party office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932798">The new member for <Affiliation DbId="299975" Type="2">Calgary Heritage</Affiliation>, in his very first speech in the House, was going on about the rise in the price of potatoes, and he blamed it on the carbon tax. Calgary gets its potatoes from Idaho. There is no carbon tax there. That does not matter to Conservatives, because they are deeply opposed to facts. Facts make them angry; they need spin.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932799">What caused the rise of price of potatoes in Calgary Heritage? It was the droughts and the wildfires in the western United States. However, the Conservatives do not want us to hear that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932800"> Here we are with a motion that is not a credible one. It is more like political toxic gibberish, which is what we have come to expect. The Conservatives are failing to deliver for Canadians, as well as leaving our children and our grandchildren to deal with a planet that is now on fire. They are missing and deliberately undermining the opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932801">I want to say one more thing so people can understand how serious this is. The EU just released its graph on Canada's forest fire average. In just over three days, Canada pumped more than 50 megatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere from wild, out-of-control forest fires. That is more than what we would normally put out in a year, and this is at the end of September. Those members know that the planet is on fire, but it is to hell with the planet and the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932802">At the same time this past week, the International Energy Agency said that the explosive growth in renewables would give us a fighting chance against the 1.5 barrier. It does give us a chance. We are seeing a huge investment in renewables around the world, and yet the Conservative Party, at every level, tries to stop, delay and deny the ability of Canada to participate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932803">My friends should look at Texas. Texas is so right wing it would fit in comfortably with the Conservatives. Texas got through the death-causing heat wave because of the massive amount of solar that is online right now in the state of Texas, with over 890,000 jobs in Texas in clean energy. More and more are coming on stream all the time, yet the Conservatives do not want people to hear that. That is why Danielle Smith tried to shut down the huge opportunities for Alberta workers, because they would rather tie themselves to an industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932830">Today I rise on an important motion that is significant to Nova Scotians and to all Canadians. As we know, after eight years of the NDP-Liberal government, Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. Earlier this week, I spoke in the House about one such example, university student Walt McDonald. Walt, like many students right across Canada, is having to choose between eating his breakfast and saving his single meal from the food bank for lunch. The Dalhousie Student Union food bank, as I informed the House, says that the food bank usage is at a record high. It says that 10 years ago, it served just snacks to students, but now students are using it for their weekly meal plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932831">This is what life is like after eight years of the NDP-Liberal government. What is the government's solution? It is to raise taxes. There is not anything it has met that it does not want to tax, and there is not anything it has met that it does not want to increase the tax on. The Liberal-NDP government has supported measures to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ per litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932832">The carbon tax hikes are coming at the worst possible time for Canadian families and for students like Walt who are struggling with the rising costs of everything due to the inflation caused by this coalition. The NDP-Liberals would argue that their cherished carbon tax is the only way to address climate change, but of course we know this is false, first, because it does nothing to improve the environment as carbon emissions continue to go up, and second, because it fails to grasp the reality of what life is like not only for Nova Scotians but for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932833">Unlike the large cities that are dense in population and have ample services like public transit, rural communities like mine do not enjoy those same amenities. When a lobster fisherman wakes up before dawn to go on the water in February, there is no public transit system to take him to the local dock at four in the morning. A forestry worker who drives from Lunenburg to Northfield in 20 minutes cannot spend an extra four hours to commute via bicycle. A senior living on OAS and CPP does not have $30,000 to spare to upgrade their heating system to solar, or even $10,000. The MP for <Affiliation DbId="278112" Type="2">Central Nova</Affiliation> brags about his solution for everything in our affordability crisis, which is to install a $10,000 heat pump.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932834">These are the realities of what life is like in Nova Scotia and other rural communities across Canada. Taxing these everyday realities is not a solution and is doing nothing to combat climate change. While the Liberal approach is to punish working people for heating their homes and driving to work, Conservatives believe we should protect our environment with technology and not taxes, by developing Canada's energy sector to utilize cleaner energy like natural gas and propane. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels like coal in favour of clean natural gas, Canada could develop its energy sector from coast to coast and finally end its import of dirty fuels from overseas dictatorships such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, which are what we have to use in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932835">These are the fuels we are forced to use in our homes and to drive our vehicles in Nova Scotia because the Liberals would rather we do that than have a pipeline to the east coast from the Prairies with some of the cleanest oil and gas on the planet. They would rather have us use electricity from burning coal imported from Columbia than extract the trillions of cubic feet of shale gas we have right in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. We actually import shale gas from the United States into Nova Scotia thanks to the efforts of the NDP-Liberal coalition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932836">By unleashing Canada's natural resource sector and approving good Canadian projects, global emissions would be reduced. That is because Canada has the strictest environmental regulations in the world for producing these resources. The oil extracted in Canada is the cleanest, most efficient energy in the world. On top of that, the emissions produced by shipping oil across the Atlantic Ocean from Saudi Arabia completely negate any benefit from any supposed improvement by the carbon tax. </ParaText>

Let us make Canada a place where nuclear and hydroelectricity are welcomed, not admonished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932838">The other issue the Liberals argue is that they believe this tax is revenue-neutral and that through this climate action incentive payment, as they euphemistically call it, eight out of 10 families will receive more in rebate cheques than they pay out. That is sort of typical Liberal math, where they cannot find a million people whom they have let in. They cannot add that, and on top of that, they actually believe that one can tax somebody and give them back more money than they paid out. It does not make any basic economic sense. It is completely false, as we know from the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932839">The report stated that Nova Scotians would see a net loss of $1,500 from the carbon tax despite the receipt of climate action incentive payments from the Liberals. The truth is that the Liberal carbon tax is bad for Nova Scotia. If those rebates were working, Nova Scotia Liberal MPs would not be calling on their own government to increase the size of those cheques. Obviously those cheques are not having any impact on our cost of living crisis. If they were, two weeks ago after caucus, in a unified force under the member for <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, the MPs would not have gone out and said that they should increase those payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932840">The Liberals' solution to the carbon tax problem of the cost of living is to actually increase payments to people, not get rid of the problem in the first place. It is the carbon tax that is causing it. Despite this, the Liberals from Atlantic Canada support raising the cost of living on Nova Scotian families. Since 2015, the Liberal members from Atlantic Canada have voted 23 times in Parliament for the carbon tax, the increases in the carbon tax and the budgetary measures to increase the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932841">The Liberal members from Atlantic Canada have an opportunity today to show that they will actually speak up for their constituents and not for their leader, demand that the cause of the problem be removed from the cost of living, and demand that their own government remove the carbon tax. They know, because they heard it all summer, that the carbon tax is the main irritant that the government has caused to the economic well-being of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932842">The member who spoke previously mocked anyone drawing attention to the cost of living increases. I will do it again, since he does not seem to care about the price of anything, which is, again, why he will soon be the former member for that riding. Under the NDP-Liberal coalition government, lettuce is up 94%, onions are up 69%, cabbage is up 70%, carrots are up 74%, potatoes are up 73%, oranges are up 77% and apples are up 61%. The only thing that is up in this country, besides taxes, is the cost of everything, thanks to the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932843">It is hypocritical of these members to stand up and say that we should stand out, take a different view on this and stand up for our constituents. I challenge them to, once and for all, speak for what their constituents told them this summer, which I know was not happy. They told me personally that what they heard at the door was not happy. They should stand up and support this motion and oppose the government's continued policy of increasing the cost of living on every Canadian and every Nova Scotian.</ParaText>

How realistic is it to have that expectation? If the government does not have that prepared, is the Conservative Party going to prepare and actually table that legislation within seven days after this motion fails? It is very juvenile.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7932866">Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to this motion on the Liberal-NDP carbon tax. I want to answer five questions in my remarks today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932867">The first is to talk a bit about the effects of the tax. There is certainly no doubt that the Liberal-NDP carbon tax is having a significant impact on affordability for all Canadians. We only have to look at how it layers on top of layers. When farmers are hit with the carbon tax, what do members think happens? Of course, it raises the cost of food. When those who transport those goods, whether it be our food or other goods, are hit with the carbon tax on the fuel they use for transport, what do members think happens? It increases the price of goods that everyone buys. When producers, stores and businesses are faced with all the cost increases that come along the distribution chain and on the inputs they have, what do members think happens? Of course, it raises the price of everything people buy. At the end of the day, who ends up paying for all of that? It is Canadians who are suffering. Canadians who are struggling to get by right now are faced with additional cost increases because of the Liberal-NDP carbon tax. That is the effect this tax has. Everything that Canadians buy and consume becomes more unaffordable. It makes it more difficult for them to feed their families, heat their homes and fuel up their cars to get to and from work, or their children's soccer practices, and things like that. That is the only effect it has had, quite frankly, because it has had no impact on reducing emissions. Its only impact has been to make life more unaffordable for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932868">What have been the results? The claim here is what we have heard many members of the Liberal-NDP government and the Bloc Québécois say, which is that the whole point is to make people feel some pain. They want to make people feel pain so they will somehow adjust their behaviour, as if there somehow might be a choice in Canada for people to not heat their homes. I do not think there is a choice for most Canadians as to whether they will heat their homes or not. We live in a cold country and in the winter people need to heat their homes, so we are not going to incentivize them by saying that they will freeze in the dark in their homes. Frankly, that is not a choice that people can or should make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932869">When we talk about this idea that somehow it is going to have some impact and make people feel pain, yes, it certainly has made them feel pain. It has forced people to make those difficult choices of letting their kids go a bit hungrier so they can afford to heat their homes or afford to drive to work. There is no doubt it has made people feel pain, but has it had an impact on the environment? Certainly not. The Liberal government has never met an emissions target, because its only approach has been to try to make Canadians feel pain and to make life more unaffordable for them. That is not the way to approach the situation we face. All that has done is make people feel that pain needlessly. That has been the result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932870">Not only that, our oil and gas sector has been vilified, which is harmful to our economy. It harms people's paycheques and the opportunities for not only Albertans in my home province, but people all across this country, as well as their livelihoods, which in some cases have been taken away. In other cases they are struggling that much more to try and get by. If we hit them with a carbon tax and a second carbon tax on top of that, it just becomes more difficult for people to live their lives. That is what the result has been.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7932871">How has the government gotten away with this? We only need look at the text of our opposition day motion itself to provide that reminder to Canadians. It notes that the so-called clean fuel standard that the Bloc Québécois supports would raise gas prices in Quebec by a whopping 17¢ per litre. The Bloc has openly stated that carbon taxes need to be increased much more radically. This is, of course, absolutely ridiculous at a time when people in that province, like in every other province, are already struggling to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932872">Of course, the NDP and Liberals have supported measures to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ per litre, which will only further burden already struggling Canadians, and they are empowered to do so by members of caucus from all regions of the country. I will give an example of the Atlantic Canada members of Parliament. They claim they are not in favour of carbon taxes, and yet they have supported carbon tax measures 23 times since the current government has been in office. Canadians absolutely deserve much better than that kind of deceptive behaviour. This is a clear indication that they have absolutely no regard for the financial well-being of their own constituents. Instead, they just have a blind adherence to their <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and their political party. It is those parties' penchant for ignoring the real costs and the true impact on the taxpayer, who is paying the freight. That is what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932873">We are in a position in this country where the Liberal-NDP government constantly demands more and more from Canadians to fund its agenda. It ends up trapping them in a vicious circle where those same policies that fire the very inflation leave them with less and less to pay for them. No government measure illustrates that better than the Liberal-NDP-Bloc carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932874">I would like to touch on the outcome of those Liberal-NDP-Bloc policies. I mentioned earlier that the Liberals have never met an emissions target in eight years, so it is clear that their carbon tax, which they claim they have to charge in order to curb emissions, is just simply a monumental Trojan Horse concealing what is simply a monstrous cash grab. Their so-called price on carbon raises the cost of absolutely every good and service as it gets downloaded through manufacturing, production and distribution chains to land on the Canadian consumer. Not only is the carbon tax buried in the price of everything that we buy, Canadians also find it as a direct line item on their utility bills for essentials, such as home heating, and many of the other products that we need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932875">We have seen that Liberal policies have accomplished the absolute opposite of what government policy should do. The intent should be to help those who are most vulnerable in our society and, at the very least, to cause them no harm. Unfortunately, the Liberal carbon tax has been causing outsized harm to those same vulnerable groups. The tax has led to an increase in the cost of goods and services that most impacts those who are already struggling to make ends meet. We are seeing that first-hand in the struggles of low-income families, seniors on fixed incomes and people living in rural areas when they are faced with higher transportation costs and what that means to an already stretched household budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932876">Instead of helping the most vulnerable, the Liberal carbon tax has created those burdens on people who can least afford it. Since Parliament resumed last week, we have heard Conservative members explain the impacts on the cost of food, for example, that inflation, the carbon tax and other government measures are having. I will not get into those details, but we have heard them. They have been elaborated on quite significantly in this House by many members of my party. Liberal members heckle and seem to be tired of hearing about it, but the truth is, because they do not want to hear it repeated, that when we tax the farmer, when we tax the trucker and tax everyone involved in the supply chain, we tax the consumer and make life more unaffordable for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7932877">At the end of the day, we need to see the carbon tax axed so we can bring down the price on everything for Canadians. There is only one party in this House of Commons that will do that, and it is the Conservative Party.</ParaText>

They are putting up policies that make it impossible for the industry to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932883">What does that mean? That means that instead of using Albertan and Canadian oil and gas, which is the most environmentally friendly in the world, we are seeing oil being used from places like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and others that do not have that same environmental record. That then harms the opportunity for Canadians to make a living and for Canadians to be able to afford to heat their homes and feed their families, and that is the—</ParaText>

Not once in their speeches have we heard them say that we need to make more of an effort to fight climate change. We never hear them say what my colleagues said earlier, that the oil companies made $200 billion in profits in 2022. We never hear them talk about how the government is helping out the oil companies. In fact, it has helped them to the tune of $82 billion in subsidies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932901">Like many members in the House, I went across my riding this summer and talked to people about what was affecting them the most. I would be very surprised if most members did not hear the feedback that the cost of living is really hampering everyone across the country. The cost of mortgages has doubled. Twenty-five per cent of mortgages in Canada have increased rapidly, and those Canadians are struggling to make their mortgage payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932902">The cost of groceries is going nowhere but up. Carrots and oranges are up 75%. Potatoes are up 74%. Lettuce is up 94%. That is hitting people's pocketbooks each and every time they go to the grocery store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932903">With regard to the cost of home heating and the the cost of gas, in Saskatchewan we do not have the luxury of going on a transit system to and from work very often. People drive to work. Moms have to drive their kids to soccer, football and hockey. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278422" Type="2">Banff—Airdrie</Affiliation> put it very rightly when he said that it is not a luxury to heat our homes in the winter in Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932904">Saskatchewan gets pretty cold in the winter. I am not sure if other members have been there in January, but -40°C is quite a regular occurrence. I say that because I want to tell a bit of a personal story about what happened to my family and a friend of mine and their kids on the way home from hockey one night a couple of years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932905">They were coming home from the rink and a blizzard just came in. They were halfway home and the people from the rink all stopped in the middle of the road to make sure they could see. They could not, so they were stuck. Actually, eventually, my wife and kids and my friend ended up hitting the ditch. The temperature that day when they got to hockey practice was -10°C. By eight o'clock at night, when they were in the ditch, it was -30°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932906">This is one thing I always think about when we talk about the use of electric vehicles, which sometimes and in some places are useful. That night, my wife, my three kids, my friend and his kids spent nine hours in a vehicle in -40°C. If that was an electric vehicle, they would all be dead right now. There are places where electric vehicles can be used, but this is a situation where it would have been catastrophic. There were 10 to 12 cars lined up in a row when this snowstorm hit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932907">Yes, we have to do better and use technology to make sure that we can lower our emissions, but sometimes there is a necessity to maintain what we have right now. That is one thing I want to put on the record. Sometimes when we tax people there is no choice but to still use fossil fuels in this country and still use clean, sustainably made and produced fossil fuels from our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932908">My colleague also had another great point. Whenever we do not use oil and gas from Canada, we ship it in from nations across the world that do not have anywhere near the environmental standards that we have in this country. Actually, in essence, the less fossil fuel we use from Canada from our oil and gas sector, which we do not promote because we think it is a dirty word, the more the world's emissions go up. If we want to talk about the environment, we will talk about the environment all day on this side, because we believe that technology, not taxes, will fix this problem and lower emissions in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932909">I look forward to splitting my time with a member of the Liberal Party sooner rather than later. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932910">To get back to the point, the crux of this motion is to make life more affordable for all Canadians. I think the NDP and Bloc doth protest too much. I have heard a lot of passion coming from the Bloc and the NDP about this motion, because it hits a little too close to home for them. They realize that they are on the wrong side of this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932911">The Conservatives have been talking about affordability for years and the fact that there is a financial crisis coming. Costs are rising on everything, and that is affecting pocketbooks and making people in this country try to stretch their paycheque further and further each month. I asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="278728" Type="2">Milton</Affiliation> about food bank usage in his city and he could not answer because he is too busy talking from prepared PMO notes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932912">I will talk about the food bank usage in my city of Regina. In 2017-18, food banks gave out about 48,573 hampers, and we need to do better than that. The unfortunate fact is that in 2022-23, they had to give out 75,246 hampers. That is a 64.5% increase in the amount of food they had to give out at the food bank in Regina. The even sadder part is that 40% of the food bank usage was by people under 18. I will say that again: 40% of the food bank usage in my city is by people under 18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932913">We keep hearing from the NDP-Liberal government that it has never been so good in this country. However, after eight years this country is broken. Nine out of 10 young people in this country do not think they will be able to afford a home, ever. We used to pay off a mortgage in 25 years. Now in this country, people need 25 years to save up to afford the down payment on a home. That is not the Canada I want my three children to grow up in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932914">There are measures that we can take immediately. I heard from the parliamentary secretary that people get more back from the carbon tax. That is not true. People go to the grocery store. If the government taxes the farmer who grows the food, taxes the trucker who trucks the food and taxes the grocery store owner who has to keep the lights on and sell the food, that all trickles down to the consumer. The grocery rebate does not cut it. It is not making up the difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932915">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself stood up and said thank goodness the government increased the child tax benefit because it helps to pay the mortgages that have increased. That is not the point of that benefit. It is supposed to help raise kids and help put kids in sports, not help pay mortgages, which have continually increased because of out-of-control spending by the current Liberal government and its NDP junior partner. It is out-of-control spending. When the government put $60 billion more debt onto the backs of Canadians in this country with its last budget, that caused inflation to rise. When inflation rises, that causes the Bank of Canada to increase interest rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932916">Do not take my word for it. Tiff Macklem, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, said that every time there is an announcement that the carbon tax is going up, inflation goes up across the country. That is exactly what the Governor of the Bank of Canada said to the people of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932917">We are also talking about what we can do, and everyone asks what our plan is. Our plan is to control spending, which would decrease inflation and decrease interest rates, incentivize municipalities to build houses so housing becomes more affordable once again, and give building bonuses to the municipalities that are far exceeding the targets they have. That is what we are talking about doing. There is hope for this country, and we are going to turn hurt into hope in the coming years. We will roll out plans that involve technology, not taxes, for the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932918">What is interesting is that the New Democrats, the Bloc members and the Liberals have all talked about how much they care about the environment. The funny thing is that the NDP-Liberal coalition has never met an emissions target that it has set. It has caused all this pain for our country, including an affordability crisis, a housing crisis and doubling the price of rent, and it has done nothing to hit an emissions target for the environment. The Liberals committed to planting two billion trees. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278382" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation> has actually planted more trees than has the entire government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932919">When it comes to putting Canadians first, we will always put Canadians first and listen to our constituents. I am happy to support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932921">Let us start with oil imports. Today, the rate of oil imports coming into our country is lower than it has been in decades. In fact, it is lower than it was at the time of the Conservative government of which the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was a member. There were actually higher oil imports at that time. I wanted to correct that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932922">I will also correct another piece. When we are talking about inflation and the connection to carbon pricing, the Bank of Canada said that the impact of the carbon price on inflation is 0.15%. That is less than half of a per cent, so the numbers the member opposite is stating are just incorrect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932936">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to take part in this debate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932937">Our government is relentlessly focused on building an economy with stable prices, steady growth and abundant, good middle-class jobs. The last three years have been difficult, which has increased the financial pressure on Canadians. First the country was slammed by the COVID pandemic, then came the COVID recession, supply chain bottlenecks, labour shortages, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, wildfires and hurricanes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932938">Fortunately, the Canadian economy has remained resilient, and in many ways, we are performing much better than our international peers. There are nearly one million more Canadians in the job market today than before the pandemic, and the OECD predicts next year Canada will experience the strongest economic growth among all G7 countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932939">Since 2015, our government has been making significant investments to support Canadians and make life more affordable through actions that are making a real impact and putting more money in the pockets of Canadians. For example, the government is supporting about 3.5 million families annually through the tax-free Canada child benefit, with families receiving up to $7,400 per child under the age of six, which is an increase of $440 from last year. In fact, the latest payment was issued to Canadian families just last week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932940">Over the past seven years, the Canada child benefit has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty and provides real, meaningful support to middle-class families every single month. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932941">Our government has also increased old age security benefits for seniors aged 75 and older by 10% as of July 2022, which is providing more than $800 in additional support to full pensioners. This is in addition to strengthening the Canada pension plan, which will eventually raise the maximum retirement benefit by up to 50%. Increases to the guaranteed income supplement for the lowest income single seniors has raised benefits for nearly 900,000 low-income seniors. Our government has also enhanced and expanded the Canada workers benefit to better support millions of low- and modest-income Canadian workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932942">In 2021, the latest year we have data for from Statistics Canada, there were close to 2.3 million fewer Canadians living in poverty compared to 2015. In other words, in 2021, 7.4% of Canadians lived in poverty, which is down from 14.5% in 2015. Our government remains committed to reaching its goal of a 50% reduction in poverty by 2030 based on 2015 levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932943">Through measures and programs like the ones I have just highlighted, we have strengthened the social safety net millions of Canadians count on, all the while ensuring Canada maintains the lowest deficit and net debt-to-GDP ratio of G7 countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932944">In the past year, we have supported Canadians through global inflation by introducing a suite of targeted measures to help the Canadians who needed it most to help them pay their bills. This included a one-time inflation relief payment last fall to 11 million low- and modest-income Canadians, which was worth up to $467 for a couple with two children and up to $234 for a single Canadian without children. It also included direct tax-free payments of up to $1,300 per child over two years to eligible families to cover dental expenses for their children under the age of 12 while we continue to work on implementing the new Canadian dental care plan. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932945">Since 2015, it has been obvious that our priority is to build a strong middle class so that everyone can succeed, and it will continue to be like this. That is why, at the beginning of this fall session, our government tabled an important bill, the affordable housing and grocery act, which would eliminate the GST on new apartment construction projects, in addition to helping to stabilize grocery prices for Canadians. These are foundational investments that continue to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932946">Even the pillar of our climate action plan, a price on carbon, is providing more money for most Canadians than it costs them. Climate change is a threat to Canadians and the entire world, and carbon pricing is an essential tool to address it. We know that Canada, like the rest of the world, needs to transition our economy as quickly as possible to clean sources of energy, so we can eliminate carbon pollution, which is changing the climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932947">In 2008, in my own home province of British Columbia, the government implemented North America’s first broad-based carbon tax, which applies to the purchase and use of fossil fuels and covers approximately 70% of provincial greenhouse gas emissions. The Conservatives may think it was a joint NDP and government bill, but it was the free enterprise premier at that time, Mr. Gordon Campbell, who was the one who brought in this leadership when it came to the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932948">In 2016, when we announced the pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon pollution, some provinces, including British Columbia, were already leading the charge on pollution pricing and were seen as global leaders. The pan-Canadian approach was designed to leave provinces and territories the flexibility to continue to lead with their own pollution pricing systems, while setting minimum national standards that ensured carbon pollution pricing would be in place across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932949">Canada’s carbon pollution pricing policy is designed to be affordable for Canadians while growing a clean economy. All of the direct proceeds from the federal carbon pricing system are returned to the jurisdictions where they were collected. If we do not act, we will face a world of ever-increasing costs and instability due to natural disasters, such as forest fires, flooding and crop failures. This summer’s wildfires and natural disasters throughout Canada was a reminder that we must take serious action, as fast as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932950">In conclusion, our relentless focus as a government is on investing in Canadians, restoring middle-class prosperity and building a country where everyone has a real chance to succeed. The members opposite are calling for action and, frankly, we are doing just that.</ParaText>

I am quite interested to speak to today's Conservative opposition day motion, brought forward by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. It speaks to many of the issues that we are dealing with in society and how best to tackle them in today's economy, in today's Canada and the world context that we are situated in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932969">I am pleased to take part in today's debate to speak about the economic situation in Canada and the rest of the world, and some of the measures we, as a government, are taking to make life more affordable from coast to coast to coast in this beautiful country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932970">We know that interest rates are high, and that is weighing heavily on Canadians. We know rates have become what I would call normalized after the 2008-09 financial crisis, and we are seeing this both here in Canada and in the United States. Liquidity measures have been reversed, there is quantitative easing and so forth. We are seeing a return to normalized rates. However, we know that this is, in part, being driven by global inflation and the battle against it, as well as the normalization of the economy post-COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932971">Global inflation has driven up the cost of necessities, and people are worried about their family finances. Canadian consumer prices rose by 4% last month. That is why our government is focused on building an economy with strong and consistent growth, as well as abundant, well-paying middle-class jobs. We are committed to helping Canadians get through this difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932972">We are seeing some positive results from all our hard work. The OECD projects that Canada will have the strongest economic growth in the G7 next year. DBRS Morningstar also recently confirmed our AAA credit rating earlier this month. I would note that I actually worked at DBRS for a number of years before going into the bond markets here in Canada. I would like to say hello to many of my colleagues who are still at that entity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932973">There are 980,000 more Canadians employed now than before the pandemic. Most notably, the labour force participation rate for Canadians in their prime working years reached a new record of 85.7% in June.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7932975">Studies show that every dollar invested in early childhood education generates between $1.50 and $2.80 in economic activity for the broader economy. Affordable early learning and child care is important to our economy and to our country. It is one of the most important ways we are helping middle-class families across Canada with real, meaningful support every single month. All provinces and territories have signed agreements with the federal government, reducing the average cost by over 50%, and we are on track to reach the $10-a-day child care that we committed to by 2026. That is something I think all members of this House should proud of and applaud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932976">The government will provide an additional $625 million to support provinces and territories in investing in infrastructure that would make child care more accessible and would target underserved communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932977">I would like to say that, with my almost two-year-old in day care these days, we have seen an over 50% reduction in our day care fees, saving us approximately $800 a month in after-tax money.

              <ParaText id="7932980">Making sure Canadians have access to affordable child care is important, but we also know that far too many Canadians are struggling with the increasing cost of essentials, such as housing and groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932981">Such initiatives as putting a price on carbon, an effective and affordable way to combat climate change, has been putting more money back in the pockets of Canadians. Eight out of 10 households get more money back than they pay, with low- and middle-income households benefiting the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932982">We know that more needs to be done to address affordability. That is why we began this fall parliamentary session by introducing Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932983">I just came from subbing in on the finance committee with CMHC officials, and it was great to talk about the removal of the goods and services tax on new purpose-built rental housing to encourage the construction of more rental homes, including apartment buildings, student housing and senior residences, across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932984">I come from an area of the country where builders build houses and the associations are located. Since 2015, I will put on record, I have argued that we remove the GST on purpose-built rental housing in combination with the provinces. The GST combined with the HST would allow, encourage and incentivize more purpose-built rental housing to be built across the country and here in Ontario even more so. All the associations are applauding it. I encourage this measure and that Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document> be passed as quickly as possible by all sides of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932986">This is another tool to help create the necessary conditions to build the types of housing that we need, that Canadians need and that families want to live in. This measure would also remove the restriction in the existing GST rules to ensure that public service bodies, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, charities and qualifying non-profit organizations that build or purchase purpose-built rental housing, are permitted to claim the 100% enhanced GST rental rebate. The government is also calling on the provinces that currently apply provincial sales taxes or the provincial portion of the HST on rental housing to join us by matching our rebate for new rental housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932987">In fact, the finance minister of Ontario, an old colleague of mine whom I worked with for a number of years in Toronto at DBRS, came out that same day and said that the Province of Ontario would be joining the federal government in removing the tax on purpose-built rental housing, the HST portion on the federal side. We encourage all provinces and territories to join in, follow the lead of some of the provinces and territories and eliminate the provincial component.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932988">We are also requesting that local governments put an end to exclusionary zoning and encourage building apartments near public transit in order to have their housing accelerator fund applications approved. Earlier this month, the government announced that London, Ontario, will be the first city to benefit from this fund, and it will certainly not be the last. It represents one of the ways we are encouraging initiatives aimed at increasing housing supply. It also supports the development of complete, low-carbon, climate-resilient communities that are affordable, inclusive, equitable and diverse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932989">Every community across Canada needs to build more homes faster, so we can reduce the cost of housing for everyone. We know that there are more cranes currently in the city of Toronto than in any other city in North America. We could combine cities in North America, and we would not reach the same number of cranes. I want to salute all the builders and workers out there from the carpenters union, IBEW, the pipefitters, everyone working on the condos and high-rises in downtown Toronto, in the GTA, across Ontario and Canada who get up every morning and build the housing we need. We need to applaud them. We are going to give them more work, not just today but in the years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932990">Without more homes in our communities, it is difficult for businesses to attract the workers they need to grow and succeed. When people spend more of their income on housing, it means less money is being spent in our communities for necessities such as groceries. We are taking immediate steps to enhance competition in the Canadian economy, with a focus on the grocery sector, to help stabilize costs for middle-class Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932991">Through Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C‑56</Document>, the government is introducing the first series of legislative changes to the Competition Act to give more power to the Competition Bureau to investigate when industries are behaving unfairly, for example where price fixing or price gouging is occurring, and take enforcement action; remove the efficiencies defence, to end anti-competitive mergers that raise prices and limit choices for Canadian consumers; and empower the Competition Bureau to block collaborations that stifle competition and consumer choice, particularly in situations where large grocers prevent smaller competitors from establishing operations nearby.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932992">By making these changes, we will empower the Competition Bureau to investigate price gouging and price-fixing. I have been calling for this for a very long time. More competition and less consolidation, more innovation and lower prices mean more choice for consumers across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932993">In conclusion, our government understands that many Canadians still need to get through these difficult times. Canadians are being pressured, and we understand that. The focus of our government is investing in Canadians, restoring middle-class prosperity and building a country where everyone has a real chance to succeed. We will continue to do that day after day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933017">Madam Speaker, climate change is real and is having a major impact across Canada and around the world. We have to face that fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933018">We have two options. We can either impose taxes, like this government is doing, or we can take real action with concrete, effective measures. On September 8, in Quebec City, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, member for Carleton and leader of the Conservatives gave an important speech highlighting what our future government would do if we are fortunate enough to have Canadian voters put their faith in us. That is what we all hope for the good of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933019">The Conservative leader talked about the very real impact of climate change. That is why we believe that we need tangible measures to tackle this reality, which affects Canada and the entire planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933020">First, we need tax incentives to reduce pollution using high-tech tools. The Liberals think they need to impose a tax, but we think we need to create tax incentives for the high-tech sector to tackle climate change. We need to give the green light to green technologies and make it easier for Canadians to access green energy sources like hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy and any new technologies that we develop. We need to give the green light to green energy and stop conducting studies all the time and creating red tape. We need to take action to green-light green energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933021">We also need to promote and develop the know-how and natural resources that we have in Canada so we can export them around the world, but also make use of them here at home. In Canada, we have everything we need to make things like electric cars. I am thinking about lithium, among other things. It is on us to develop it as fast as possible in order to give Canadians and the entire planet access to the Canadian natural resources they need and the Canadian expertise that sets us apart around the world in a positive way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933022">We, the Conservatives, are proposing concrete action that will deliver real results in the fight against climate change. What is the Liberal government's approach? After eight years of the Liberal government, Canada has never met its targets. The Liberals will say that that is not true, that Canada has met them. Yes, but that was during the pandemic. I am not sure that shutting down the economy is the right thing to do, quite the opposite, in fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933023">A study examined 63 countries to see how effectively they are fighting climate change. The study was not done by the Conservatives, but rather by the UN. It found that, after eight years of this Liberal government, Canada ranks 58th out of 63 countries. Why is that? It is because this government is always quick to talk, to moralize and to lecture everyone, to blame everyone else on the planet and, above all, to tax people more. That is the problem we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933024">This government's greedy desire to take even more money out of people's pockets is its trademark. What is more, its ally in this matter, the Bloc Québécois, wants the government to radically increase the amount of money it takes out of taxpayers' pockets by radically raising the carbon tax. It is not me saying that. It is the Bloc. That is not the right thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933025">Let us set the record straight. Canada currently has two carbon taxes. The first is the Liberal carbon tax, which applies from coast to coast to coast. Here are the facts: As we have always said, Quebec and all the other provinces have full jurisdiction in this area. That is why Quebec has had a carbon exchange for over a decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933026">For federal Conservatives, it is not about deeming that good or bad. We respect Quebec's desire to have a carbon exchange, and that is fine. From time to time, the exchange is the subject of some debate in Quebec. People have been talking about it over the past few days. That is okay; that is what debate is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933027">I would like to remind the House of a statement made by a former member of Quebec's National Assembly, a former Quebec government minister and former PQ member and minister. No, I am not talking about the current Bloc Québécois leader, who is and always will be the most polluting environment minister in Quebec's history because he gave the green light to the most polluting project in Quebec's history. I am talking about Sylvain Gaudreault, the former member for Jonquière and former minister, who said that the carbon exchange was based on paying for the right to pollute. He said, “It's a major flight of capital—we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars.” I will not go into the details, but of course Quebec's carbon exchange is up for debate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933028">What people are forgetting is that the federal Liberal government gave itself the power to set the price of carbon on Quebec's carbon exchange, effective next year. We never heard the Bloc Québécois complain that it made no sense for Ottawa to barge into an area of provincial jurisdiction by setting the price of carbon. Should we be surprised? Not really, since these people support the carbon tax from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933029">That brings me to the other point. Aside from the rain, everything we own has been transported. The last I heard, Quebec is not 100% self-sufficient. Sometimes Quebeckers buy things produced outside Quebec, things produced in Canada. Invariably, these goods are transported, and transportation generally involves combustion engines. In that case, the Liberal carbon tax applies. That means the first Liberal carbon tax has a direct impact on Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933030">Let me turn to the second Liberal carbon tax. I find it comical that they have given it a big honking title rather than calling it a carbon tax. Here are the facts. Even though they refer to it as the “clean fuel regulations”, the reality remains. When the government imposes a price after a good is purchased, they can call it whatever they want, but we call it a tax. That tax, which is 17¢, will apply in Quebec. This is not coming from us; it is coming from the Parliamentary Budget Officer. After conducting an in-depth study, as he always does, he concluded that it would cost an extra 17¢. Add tax on top of that, and oil will cost 20¢ more per litre used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933031">That means that there are two carbon taxes that were created by the Liberal government and supported by the Bloc Québécois. We offered the Bloc an opportunity to distance itself from all this. On June 5, we tabled a motion to that effect, condemning both taxes and specifically the “clean fuel regulations”, yet the Bloc Québécois voted against it. That just makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933032">What especially does not make sense is the greedy attitude of the Bloc Québécois, who want to take even more money out of taxpayers' pockets. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278648" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> told the House, in that eloquent way that he has, that we need to drastically increase taxes. I respect everyone's point of view, but that is not an opinion that we share. What an arrogant, irresponsible and completely pretentious attitude toward people who are struggling to get by these days. No big deal, we just need to drastically increase taxes: That is the Bloc Québécois's policy, and it is enthusiastically supported by the Liberals, unless a Liberal plans to rise and say that they disagree. Do they agree with that? Do they agree with the idea of drastically increasing this tax?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933033">They are very quiet. Later, they will have the opportunity to say that this does not make sense, as will the other members of the Bloc Québécois. One might think that the member for Longueuil—Saint-Hubert just got carried away, but such is not the case. He said what he thinks, which is a very good thing. The problem is that this is the worst thing we could do with inflation being the way it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933034">As we speak, people in Quebec City are lining up in front of a food bank to be able to eat. That is unacceptable. Quebeckers, like all Canadians, have seen housing prices double in the past eight years. Inflation is the highest it has ever been in the last 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933035">What do the Bloc Québécois and the Liberals want to do? They want to radically increase the Liberal carbon tax. That is totally unacceptable, disrespectful and despicable, at a time when all Canadians and all Quebeckers are facing very serious problems because of inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933036">We need to join forces. Above all, we must not overtax people. We need to give them some breathing room. Taxing people is not an effective way to fight climate change.</ParaText>

It has nothing to do with his time in politics or as the environment minister provincially. It is for once again bailing out his son this morning as he has probably done so many times throughout his life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933059">I arrived in Ottawa yesterday, read the contents of today's motion, went to get my notes and realized I had forgotten everything in Kingston. My father drove halfway to Ottawa to rendezvous to deliver those notes so I could be properly prepared for today. As an avid watcher of CPAC, I am sure he is tuned in right now. I want to express my thanks to him for once again bailing out his son.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933060">I know there is a lot of information that has been talked about today in terms of the effects of pricing pollution and what this government has been able to accomplish. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="278501" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation>, who is only one of many, has spoken several times about not meeting targets and the ineffectiveness of policies that this government has brought on board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933061">I want to bring to the attention of the House the growth of these policies and put into context how effective these policies have been. The growth of the renewable energy and Canada's progress on phasing out coal-fired electricity has seen emissions from the electricity sector decrease by 64 megatonnes between 2005 and 2021. This progress puts Canada in an excellent position to meet those 2035 targets that we have set to get to a net-zero electricity grid by that point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933062">The data also shows a 16% decrease in residential emissions, with less home heating by oil being used. Many Canadians are taking the steps to change their homes' energy efficiency by making the switch to heat pumps, solar and cleaner options. I think it is very important, while I say this, to also point out that there is one sector that has continued and grown in terms of emissions, and that is the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933063">Despite the oil and gas sector continuing to grow in terms of emissions, the net emissions throughout our country have continued to decrease. In fact, the oil and gas sector is the only industry that has actually continued to increase in terms of emissions over the last few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933064">I think it is very telling, and Canadians are rightfully concerned about this, that I have presented three or four petitions since the House resumed last week specifically calling on the government for strong and bold emissions caps when it comes to this sector particularly. I think it is the right thing to do. I never comment on it when I am presenting the petition because the rules do not permit me to, but I certainly think that it is the right thing to do, to put on bold caps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933065">We are in a transition. Whether Conservatives like it or not, the world is moving away from fossil fuels. One in every 10 cars in this country that is being sold is an electric vehicle. Regardless of the fact that Conservatives do not want to believe it, it is absolutely true. As a matter of fact, in 2021, the average new light-duty vehicle had 25% to 35% lower greenhouse gas emissions than a similar new vehicle in 2011. The progress we are making is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933066">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278501" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation> got up and said we have not met our targets. There are a lot of Conservatives who have said we have not met our targets. I would rather have very bold, ambitious targets that we do not quite achieve, than loose statements like, “We are going to fix the environment with technology.” What does that even mean? That is the Conservatives' entire plan. They say they are going to fix the environment and climate change, which they suddenly believe in, with technology, and then nothing else after that.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Madam Speaker, we have evolved for the last several hundred years with the advancements of technology. I really appreciate that insight, but could they provide a bit more specifically with respect to how they are going to do it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933069">I find it very interesting that Conservatives have done this for the 11th time. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> earlier said that this was the fifth time this year. It is also the 11th time since this Parliament resumed two years ago after the election that Conservatives have brought in this motion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933070">I am glad to hear that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> allows them to speak to this topic. We certainly know that he restricts their opportunities to speak on other issues, such as that take-note debate we had last week on the possibility that India was involved in murdering a Canadian citizen. We had a take-note debate on that, and not a single Conservative member asked a question. The House leader for the Conservatives spoke for five minutes, and then they vacated the debate from that point forward. They were not allowed to speak on it. They were hushed on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933071">It also happened a couple days later when an email was sent out by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s office instructing Conservatives not to comment on the protests that were going on outside with respect to the issue of LGBTQ rights. We saw Conservatives once again being silenced by their leader. They did not say a single word. There was nothing on Facebook or on Twitter. As a matter of fact there is one member I feel really sorry for. I will not name her. She actually did tweet something, and I thought it was great that she was showing support for the LGBTQ community, only to remove it later on. I think it is extremely unfortunate that the leadership, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, told her she had to take it down, and then she obviously did that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933072">It is really interesting that we are here today speaking about something the Conservatives have brought up 11 times, and meanwhile the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> silences them with regard to other very important issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933073">However, what makes this even more interesting, confusing and perplexing, is the fact that Conservatives have a history of running on pricing pollution. I asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> why he, led by Erin O'Toole in the last election, did not say anything during the election about why he was against pricing pollution when Erin O'Toole, the man with a plan, had it in his platform. The member for Carleton said that we can go back to 2007 and see he has been against it. Why did he not say anything about it during an election, when it actually meant something?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933074">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> We did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933075">
                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Madam Speaker, he says “we did”. They are heckling me, saying they did, but the public never heard about it. I guess the member made a phone call or sent an email that only Conservatives got to see. They should stand for their principles. If they were really against it back then, they would have stood up back then during the election and actually said they were against pricing pollution, but they did not. They bought into Erin O'Toole's plan. They ran on Erin O'Toole's plan, and now they are in this place and they have brought forward 11 motions, one after another, against that plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933076">However, Erin O'Toole was not the only one. Stephen Harper also did it, so some of those Conservatives have run under multiple leaders looking to price pollution, yet here they are, once again, with no shame at all saying they did this twice under Stephen Harper and Erin O'Toole, but now are suddenly against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933077">How can people actually believe what Conservatives tell them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933078">I want to read something. This comes out of the B.C. legislature. I found it this morning. I found it very interesting. I will read a quote:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In 2008, our government made the decision to implement a tax on carbon. It was designed to help British Columbia reduce greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time be fair to hard-working families. To do that, by law, we made it—the carbon tax—revenue-neutral. What does it mean to have a revenue-neutral carbon tax? It means that every dollar collected from B.C. carbon tax is given back to taxpayers in the form of tax credits or tax cuts.</QuotePara>

Well, the fact of the matter is that we have the option of how we wanted to bring this about, as far as a carbon tax. Our policy—it’s law—is to put it back into the pockets of taxpayers. We don’t see it as a slush fund, which it appears that the NDP sees it as. Since 2008, the carbon tax has raised almost $8.5 billion and returned more than $10.6 billion in tax reductions for businesses, individuals and families.</QuotePara>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Our carbon tax appears to be working. Independent studies have found that between 2008 and 2012, fuel use in B.C. dropped by 16 percent per capita. In 2015, a review of seven independent studies suggested that B.C.’s carbon tax has reduced emissions in the province by up to 15 percent. All of this has been accomplished without taking a dime off B.C. taxpayers.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="7933083">Do we know who said that in the B.C. legislature, back on February 27, 2017? The now-Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="278707" Type="2">Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge</Affiliation>, who sits in this House, the same member who got up earlier in this debate and tried to chastise this government for bringing in a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933084">These are his words. I am not making it up. I am literally reading from the record of the B.C. legislature on February 27, 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933085">How can that member actually come into this House and speak to this issue against it as if he has any authority on it, given the comments that he made just a few years ago on this exact same issue?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933086">All I am doing here is underscoring the hypocrisy that we see time after time after time. I should really say that 11 times because they have brought in a similar motion 11 times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933087">They ran on it. They did not ever challenge their leaders on it. They spoke about it in other legislatures as if it was the be-all and end-all to fixing the problem that we have with climate change. Now, suddenly, they come in here and act as though a carbon tax, a price on pollution, is absolutely ludicrous, that it will never work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933088">Explain to me how this is not one of the ultimate forms of hypocrisy. It is literally oozing down the steps on that side of the aisle. I cannot understand how they would ever put themselves in a position to demonstrate such incredible hypocrisy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933089">All we get from Conservatives, as I indicated earlier, is finally the recognition that climate change is real. Whether humans have created it, well, they have not gone that far. I am sure they are still debating that internally, but, at least now, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278428" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> mentioned, moments ago, that climate change is real. I think I have heard a couple others say it from time to time. At least, we are hearing that now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933090">All they offer is to say that they will fix this with technology. That is their solution. They will fix this with technology and that is it, a hard stop there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933091">We can talk about what more we can do. I agreed with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> earlier, when she was speaking about this issue, when she said that the carbon tax is only one thing. Of course, it is only one thing, putting a price on pollution. We need to do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933092">I think, as I indicated earlier, that another great system that we need to implement is cap and trade. We need to bring in cap and trade and put on strong emissions caps in the oil and gas sector specifically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933093">A lot of people do not understand that, rightfully so, because it is not as simple to explain as an actual price on pollution, but the cap-and-trade model allows the government to set an overall cap on the GHG emissions for sectors covered over a given period. This cap is gradually and progressively reduced over time, encouraging the emission reductions. At the end of a three-year period, for example, emitters must obtain an emissions allowance for each tonne of GHGs they release into the atmosphere and surrender those to the government. They must surrender enough allowances to cover their emissions or penalties will apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933094">The whole idea here is nothing new, as this idea was conceived and brought into North America back in around 2005, 2006, and that was with the western initiative. This was a number of states. This was Quebec, which still, to its benefit, and rightfully so, is in the western alliance, and Ontario, at the time, although Doug Ford has backed out. This was a plan that basically put a cap on the amount of emissions and if one needed to exceed that, one would have to sell off one's emissions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933362">What I find to be even richer than that is the fact that some members of the House, in particular the member for <Affiliation DbId="278707" Type="2">Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge</Affiliation>, were part of a government that supported pricing pollution and introduced pricing pollution. That member went on to give a long speech in the British Columbia legislature about how effective pricing pollution was and how well it was working in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933363">I am sure the member felt quite confident when he ran in the 2021 election on the plan that Erin O'Toole had put forward at the time. I am sure he thought it was the right plan, because he had seen this successfully work in British Columbia. Now he is with a new <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> who does not feel the same way, and he has suddenly changed his tune. Indeed, he rose in the House earlier today and asked a question specifically on this topic, as though he never made those comments or took those positions in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933364">I find it extremely difficult to give any credibility on this issue to the Conservatives. They tend to do exactly what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> was saying earlier, which is to look for any opportunity to exploit individuals, in particular individual hardships, in order to utilize that for some kind of political gain. We continually see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933365">I would like to touch on my comments with regard to the Atlantic accord. What we do know is that both in Nova Scotia and in Newfoundland, the premiers have been calling on the government to install legislation, to give the opportunity for Atlantic Canada to benefit tremendously, economically and environmentally, but in particular economically, on a new opportunity to produce wind energy in Atlantic Canada, offshore. This is where the future is going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933366"> People can put their head in the sand and pretend that the future still remains in oil and gas. They can die by that sword by insisting that it is the only option and the only form of energy that will ever be required, or they can get with the times, open their eyes and see what is going on throughout the world, see what is going on just in our country alone with respect to that transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933367"> Even if, as Conservatives have said many times in the past, they are not in favour of that Atlantic accord, even if they still believe that oil and gas is the only way to go, why would they not be in favour of unlocking the opportunities of Atlantic Canada to potentially prosper off a new form of energy? We would think that Conservatives would at least say they do not believe it will ever happen but we should go ahead and try. They will not even do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933368">That is how beholden they are to oil and gas, generally speaking, and to the industries that are profiting billions of dollars every year. For some reason, the Conservatives are absolutely relentless in their quest to shutter any opportunity of any kind of new technology that does not involve the extraction of fossil fuels from the ground. I find that extremely troubling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933369">I always thought that eventually the Conservatives would come around, that eventually they would say that since 10 out of every 100 cars in Canada being sold are electric cars now, it is probably going in that direction. However, it seems as though the Conservatives, at every possible opportunity, absolutely claw onto and grasp at every last little straw in an attempt to hold onto the fossil fuel industry, as though it is the only thing here for their survival.</ParaText>

That was proven false by their own Parliamentary Budget Officer, as emissions keep going up and they have not hit a single emissions reduction target they set for themselves. This is why they should have thrown on a bumper sticker that said, “Not as advertised”. This was a scam from day one and it is coming to light now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933404">The carbon taxes and the carbon tax scam are also very discriminatory because every province feels them differently and gets charged differently. For Albertans, it is yet another attack on our province by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Not only has he repeatedly kicked Albertans down, he has also made sure that Alberta does not again become the prosperous province it used to be. By introducing Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, supported by the NDP, the Liberals and NDP made sure that no good pipeline projects would be able to be completed in this country. Pipelines are great way to lower emissions and not have our products transported on trains and trucks. They are safer, more secure and will bring down emissions. They can bring home not only more powerful paycheques for Canadians, but jobs, prosperity and a better economy. </ParaText>

It has repeatedly blocked projects. What is the result of that? We see dictatorships around the world making profits. We see emissions going up. As an example, Germany's chancellor came to Canada within the last year literally asking for our liquid natural gas and was willing to take it immediately. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had more than 15 good LNG projects on his desk when he became Prime Minister. Not one has been completed yet.

We heard stories of seniors having to turn down the heat in their homes and literally making do with blankets during the wintertime because, after eight years of the irresponsible Liberal-NDP government, things are way more expensive than they have ever been before. These costs have driven up everything and have made it so that 1.5 million Canadians are now visiting a food bank in a single month. Liberal inflation has driven up interest rates and Canada is most at risk in the G7 for a mortgage default crisis. This has also driven up rents and everything else. </ParaText>

She had to move in with her abusive ex-husband once again and live in that same situation because she could not afford to feed her kids anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933408">The Liberal-NDP government refuses to acknowledge that the carbon tax has real consequences. When the government is taxing the farmer who makes the food, the trucker who ships the food, the manufacturer and the people who are storing the food, that tax ultimately goes on the Canadian who is buying the food. That is the sad reality after eight years of the current incompetent Liberal-NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933409">Canadians' disposable income is getting smaller and smaller due to the deficits that the Liberal government continues to drive up. It is not just that: The Liberals have increased the cost of a house by doubling the amount of mortgages and rents and the time it takes to save up for a down payment on a house. They are also increasing the costs inside the house, like heat, gas and grocery costs. All of these have gone up and they are all inflationary, which was proven by the Governor of the Bank of Canada.</ParaText>

One, farmers are exempt from the carbon price. The Conservatives continue to talk about that. They are exempt. Two, the member talked about indigenous communities and large industrial projects. His party is standing in the way of legislation that indigenous communities in Atlantic Canada are calling for to help make a difference on those industrial projects he talks about in the renewable energy sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933415">However, I am going to ask the member a very simple question because I do want to see where the Conservatives stand. They talk about cutting all carbon pricing, but yet many industrial projects, like ones in Saskatchewan and in his home province of Alberta, are building industrial capacity on the basis of carbon pricing. Would his party cut all forms of carbon pricing that are really important to the industrial future of his province as well?</ParaText>

This has no rebates to it and is going to be very impactful in a negative way to Quebeckers. Bloc members need to join with us. They need to ask for this to be cancelled.

In Alberta, they have destroyed the renewable energy sector, which is costing tens of thousands of jobs. This is quite strange when they are saying they actually believe in renewable energy. That same government in Alberta is also attacking the retirement security of Albertans, and we saw when the Harper government was in place, that the Harper regime actually was taking apart retirement security for Canadians. As such, the issue of the credibility of Conservatives comes up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933434">Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague on his eloquence, the quality of his speech and especially his strong and passionate defence of his province, Alberta. I thank my colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933435">We are here today because after eight years of this Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the economic situation of Canadian and Quebec families is only getting worse. This morning, I saw on Twitter that there were record lineups at food banks. This happened at the Bouchée généreuse food bank in the Quebec City area. The journalist says he has never seen such long lineups before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933436">People are relying on food banks because they simply cannot afford groceries anymore, now that everything is more expensive. A Leger poll published today in Le Journal de Québec is quite worrisome, especially for young Quebeckers. More than half of young people are living paycheque to paycheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933437">That means that they get paid $500 on Thursday and, by the following Wednesday, all that money is gone and the bank account is empty. They simply have to wait for the next paycheque and hope that nothing bad happens during the night, like their car getting towed. People just do not have the money. That is what living from paycheque to paycheque means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933438">Unfortunately, in Quebec, 51% of young people are living paycheque to paycheque. The number of workers living paycheque to paycheque increased by 26% in 2022. According to the poll, this is causing more stress. The higher cost of living is demoralizing those aged 40 and under, 62% of whom feel unable to cope with societal issues, an increase of 5% compared to 2022. They feel less confident in their ability to face challenges. The cost of rent is getting to be a real problem for them: 72% say that rent makes up too big a chunk of their budget. That is 8% more than the previous year. Those are huge numbers when we talk about something as important as housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933439">I also want to quote a comment from that article. Kassendra Hachey, who is 28, said: “I live paycheque to paycheque. I work every other weekend on top of going to school. I have to work at least 24 hours to make ends meet.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933440">Unfortunately, that is the reality and situation for young Quebeckers today, after eight years of this Liberal government. With its inflationary spending, the Liberal government has made the situation intolerable. It is unacceptable for people to be experiencing a situation like this in 2023 in a G7 country like Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933441">We are at a turning point where real choices need to be made. Either we continue in the same direction where fewer and fewer people will be able to afford housing and fewer and fewer people will be able to afford food, or we choose to take action to bring down prices, mortgage payments and inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933442">That brings me to today's motion. It is a quick and easy solution that we can implement immediately and that will have a direct impact on the wallets of these young people, the wallets of every family across Canada and in Quebec. Our proposal is to cancel the carbon taxes, which are increasing the price of everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933443">I can already hear the Bloc Québécois members say—as they have said over and over again today—that the carbon tax does not apply in Quebec and that the Conservatives are wrong. They used unparliamentary language. The <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the Bloc Québécois used unparliamentary language throughout his speech this morning. Unfortunately, no one noticed. I am pointing it out because, unfortunately, the leader of the Bloc Québécois took the liberty of saying things he should not have said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933444">Any carbon tax imposed on Canadians still has an impact on Quebec. It is not complicated. This is because everything produced elsewhere in Canada is subject to the carbon tax. What is produced elsewhere in Canada is not necessarily available in Quebec. That food has to be transported all the way to Quebec. We know that a lot of food processing takes place in Ontario. It has to be transported by trucks, which are subject to the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933445">Therefore, when food reaches grocery store shelves in Quebec, it obviously costs more because twice the carbon tax will have been imposed, along with the GST. In short, Quebeckers are suffering because of the carbon tax imposed by the federal government in the other provinces across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933446">In Quebec, the Bloc Québécois had a unique opportunity to ensure that there were no additional costs on carbon added to the price per litre of gas at the pump. The government brought in the clean fuel regulations through the back door. The House did not vote on these regulations because the Liberals adopted them behind closed doors. They did not think it made much sense so they did it in secret.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933447">We saw them coming. We moved a motion on June 5 to say that it did not make sense to increase the price of gas per litre again when Canadians and Quebeckers do not have any money left in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933448">Anyone who lives in a big province like Quebec will know that a car is vital for getting around in the regions. Sometimes it takes two cars to get around, go to work, attend activities, do what needs to be done. We saw the Liberals coming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933449">We therefore moved a motion to repeal the carbon taxes that are indirectly affecting the cost of groceries and to ask the government to repeal the clean fuel regulations. These regulations, which the Liberals snuck in under the radar, were actually a second carbon tax. We wanted to prevent the price of gas from going up 20¢ a litre plus GST for Quebeckers. We told ourselves that anyone with any common sense who wants to defend the interests of Quebeckers would agree with this common-sense motion so that we could put money back in Quebeckers' pockets right away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933450">We were in for a surprise. The Bloc Québécois, which claims to be the great defender of the interests of Quebec and the regions of Quebec, did not support our motion. We were sure that the Bloc Québécois would support this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933451">The Liberals voted against it. The NDP voted against it, which is not surprising because that is how the costly NDP-Liberal coalition operates. The NDP followed the Liberals' lead. The Bloc Québécois voted against this motion, against repealing carbon tax 2.0, which would have stopped the government from raising the price of gas by 20¢ a litre in Quebec by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933452">The Conservatives were the only ones to stand up, but unfortunately, there are not enough of us. Since July 1, Quebeckers have been included in the clean fuel regulations, which will make gas and groceries more expensive. Those are the facts. That is the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933453">Not only is that the truth, but we were flabbergasted by what we found out later. We wanted to understand why the Bloc Québécois would not vote in favour of our motion to cut carbon taxes. We started digging through Hansard to find some of the speeches made by members. We realized that the Bloc Québécois members love increasing the price of gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933454">On May 26, 2020, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278377" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation> said, “Here are some ideas of what we can do. We can increase the carbon tax. Yes, I said it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933455">On February 7, 2023, she said, “We need to keep the fuel tax. We cannot give in and cancel it, which would be dangerous and get us nowhere. I never said it would be easy. It is not easy, but we have to do it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933456">What is she saying we have to do? Take more money out of Quebeckers' pockets. That is what that means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933457">On June 1, 2023, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278377" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation> also said, and I quote, “we are not in favour of cancelling the clean fuel regulations. In addition, we do not approve of the Conservative grandstanding on the important issue of inflation and the rising cost of living.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933458">Did I understand that correctly? Does the Bloc Québécois not see the rise in inflation and the cost of living? This is not grandstanding. It is reality. I think it is high time that the Bloc members opened their eyes and took a look at what is happening around them and what is happening in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933459">On June 1, 2023, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278335" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation> said, and I quote, “In my opinion, saying that the carbon tax is responsible for today's inflation is a simplistic solution to a complex problem.”</ParaText>

It forces the Bank of Canada to say that interest rates have to be increased to slow the economy down because costs are increasing too quickly. What does that do? It increases the cost of mortgages. What does that do? It annihilates any hope young people may have of ever owning a house. That is what eight years of a Liberal government does.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933482">Madam Speaker, as usual, it is a pleasure to meet with my colleagues in the House of Commons to discuss and debate a motion moved by the Conservative Party for their opposition day. I am always pleased when I have the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with my Conservative colleagues on their proposals because it is an opportunity to understand their position, their priorities and their vision for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933483">I am not usually one to get upset, but unfortunately, most of the proposals they have made over the past few years have made me sad because they are bad for Canada. Today, we are studying a motion on the carbon pricing. More specifically, the Conservatives are calling on the government to introduce a bill to eliminate all carbon pricing to lower the price of gas, groceries and heating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933484">I will begin by explaining why the government put a price on carbon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933485">The threat posed by climate change is very real. It is not a problem that is only going to happen in the future. It is happening now. All of our regions felt it this summer when we had the worst wildfire season in the history of Canada. There has also been flooding across the country, particularly in my riding of Kings—Hants. What is more, the frequency and intensity of storms is definitely a challenge for all Canadians. It is a challenge for everyone. We are familiar with this reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933486">The initiatives put in place by the government and all parliamentarians in the House are for our children and grandchildren.

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7933487">I want to highlight that there are 77 carbon pricing initiatives around the world. I have had the opportunity to go to the World Bank site, and people can actually look at where they exist in the world and what types of initiatives other countries, other jurisdictions, have taken on. It is not as though Canada is the only country in the world that has a price on carbon. There are many other countries that go that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933488">The Conservatives like to draw attention to carbon pricing. Nowhere did the Government of Canada, on this side, ever suggest that carbon pricing alone is going to be a silver bullet mechanism to help solve climate change. In fact, it is one mechanism among many that this government has presented. However, as I have said and perhaps teased some of my Conservative colleagues opposite on, the idea of introducing a price signal into the market and letting the market respond accordingly is inherently a small-c conservative principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933489">I asked the member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation> about the fact that there are projects across this country from companies that are responding to the price signal and driving really important innovation. The Conservatives like to talk about the slogan “technology, not taxes”, and it is indeed a slogan because they have no evidence of how they are going to incentivize the private sector and our great Canadian companies to make innovations and drive transitional change. Billions of dollars in this country are premised on that, and not only do companies now understand that it is in their best interests to do this because it is where there are generational opportunities, but of course they want to get around the price signal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933490">The Conservatives stand here today and do not signal that they are willing to support any form of carbon pricing in this country. That is problematic because billions of dollars of investment in this country rest upon that. Indeed, I will not suggest that we have it perfect, and I will get into that in my remarks, but the Conservatives do not offer a compelling alternative whatsoever. They just simply oppose without putting forward any solutions of their own.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933491">From a political perspective, I am curious about and interested in this motion, particularly the way it is worded. Perhaps the Conservatives and the Bloc Québécois are fighting. The Conservatives named the Bloc Québécois in the text of their motion. I think there must be some kind of argument going on between the Conservatives and the Bloc Québécois. Perhaps the alliance between the two parties has started to break down because of the Conservatives' actions. We will see, but that is what I think is happening right now. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7933492">I want to start with the clean fuel standard. I note this initiative just so that all my colleagues, Canadians watching at home and perhaps people here in the gallery can understand what it is. The clean fuel standard is an initiative to reduce the carbon intensity in the fuels that we use. There have been other initiatives throughout time that I would say are similar to it. For example, there were times that we moved on regulations to remove lead from the fuel we use in our cars. I believe that initiative was championed by the Mulroney government some years ago, back when the Conservatives were progressive and we had actual action on climate and environmental initiatives coming from the Conservative Party of Canada. However, indeed, it was the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and I will continue to remind Canadians that there is a difference. My constituents remind me every day that there is a big difference between the predecessor party that someone like Scott Brison was elected to in 1997 and what the Conservative Party of Canada has become today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933493">This is the initiative: to decarbonize our fuels. We are essentially asking oil and gas refiners in Canada to do that. They can do so with a number of different initiatives. They can add biofuels into the content of their fuels. They can work with farmers. There are tremendous opportunities in the agriculture sector to do offsets through credits. They can work on putting out charging stations. They can put home heating pump programs in place to demonstrate that they are getting the carbon intensity of their fuel down. There are a ton of options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933494">I want to talk about the projects. The Conservatives often talk about the cost. Indeed, they have in the text of this motion “17 cents per litre”. The parliamentary budget office has said that perhaps in 10 to 12 years there will be a 17¢ cost. In Nova Scotia, that was three cents a litre this summer. Yes, the program is not designed to rebate, but the program also drives industrial action. For example, the Conservatives have not stepped up today and talked about Come By Chance, the sustainable aviation fuel facility in Newfoundland and Labrador, with 87 million dollars' worth of investment in the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador. It matters. The Conservatives have not talked about the electrolyzer. I have to be honest: I do not know what that is, but Irving Oil knows that it matters to its clean energy future. It has invested $90 million in it as part of the hydrogen strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933495">I was out in Regina, Saskatchewan. Perhaps a Saskatchewan member of Parliament will engage with me on this. A big billion-dollar co-operative is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help drive its initiatives, in part because of the clean fuel standard. However, the Conservatives never talk about that, and it is important to note it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933496">The Conservatives are concerned about the three cents a litre in Nova Scotia, and I do not want to sound dismissive; I know every penny matters right now. The affordability question is an important one. However, if the Conservatives want to highlight the three-cents-a-litre increase on gasoline in Nova Scotia as a result of the clean fuel standard, they also need to highlight the major industrial investments being made in the Atlantic region. Maybe, as I have done publicly, they could encourage the provinces to see that, while the program was not designed to rebate, provinces have more money in their treasuries as a result of these major industrial projects and could reduce the provincial gas tax to make sure that is taken care of. They could do that. These are some suggestions that I offer to my Conservative colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933497">The text of the motion is inherently, and I better not use the word “misleading”, but I have problems with the contents and the way the motion is written. For example, on 17¢ litre, the Conservatives do not give any context to the reader at home about what that means. They talk about things such as quadrupling to 61¢, and they give no context. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933498">It was tripling just a few months ago. We would hear Conservative members, like a flock of crows, saying, “triple, triple, triple”, and we heard that for months. I guess now they are going to have to say “quadruple, quadruple, quadruple, quadruple”. I do not know how it has changed, but it has changed. They play a little loose and fast with the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933499"> Again, the question around affordability and the question about whether or not we can look at adjusting measures under the carbon price is fair game. I am there, and I am going to get to that in my speech, but it is the idea that somehow they just basically put this out that I have problems with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933500">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation> stood up in this House a few speeches ago and said that the carbon price applies to a tractor driving on a farm. That is fundamentally untrue. If the Conservatives want to suggest that the carbon price applies to grain drying and that it should be removed, then yes, that is factually correct. They can go there. I have stood here and voted for the bill that came forward, Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933501">However, we have to keep the debate in some realm of fact. It is like we are in a post-truth era, when people get up to say anything. I know we can have different perspectives on this, and I know that there is a range of debate, but we have to keep this in the confines of what is actually real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933502">On that, as we have talked about the price of fuel, groceries and home heating, I have an article from the National Post. I know that the Conservatives read the National Post because, of course, it is a bit more conservative leaning. I think some of it is fair. I read it too. The article is from September 21, 2023, so not that long ago, and I would encourage all members of the House to read it. There was a question about how much the carbon price contributes to the things the Conservatives are talking about today. I will read from the article, which I am happy to table later if I get unanimous consent. It says that the Bank of Canada estimates that 0.15% of inflation is tied to carbon pricing. Yes, there is some impact, but what we do not talk about, of course, is that the money is being rebated back to households. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933503">The article also says that the carbon price contributes to less than 1% of the cost of groceries. When we look at what the Conservatives are calling for, yes, every dollar matters, but when we talk about this being a mechanism to drive some of those industrial projects I talked about earlier, that is extremely important. In fact, Trevor Tombe, who is an economist from Alberta, cites that it is 30¢ on every $100 grocery bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933504">This is an important question, but the Conservatives are essentially calling for a reduction of 30¢ on every $100 that is spent on groceries in this country. I think they should join us in other initiatives that really matter for being helpful support: child care, the Canada child benefit and supports for seniors. There are a lot of different initiatives that they can get on board with. I am not so convinced that this one alone would solve the question of affordability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933505">I have talked about carbon pricing as it relates to major industrial projects, and I think I have exhausted that one. However, I look forward to my hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278784" Type="2">Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame</Affiliation> standing up. We will have a great debate on whether or not that matters to his province, and we will get that on the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933506">I want to talk about the position of Atlantic MPs, because we Liberal Atlantic MPs are specifically noted in the text of the motion before us. I cannot speak for every one of my Atlantic Liberal colleagues, as that would be inappropriate, but I will speak as one Atlantic Liberal member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933507">Unlike what the leader of the official opposition had to say in question period today, I am not against carbon pricing. I am calling on this government to have adjustments to its approach on the federal backstop. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933508">Unlike my Conservative colleagues, who just want to burn it down and say, “No, this is terrible”, but offer no solutions, I am trying to be constructive in both my comments here in the House, anything I say publicly, and what I say to my constituents on the intent of the policy. I go back to climate change and the generational challenge that we have before us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933509">This government is trying to move in the right direction, and the intent is the right one, but I think there are a couple of things that need to be adjusted. I am happy to talk about them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933510">First of all, the definition of what qualifies as a rural community has to be re-examined. Right now, if one lives in a census metropolitan area versus if one is outside defines whether one is urban or rural. We know the country is a bit more nuanced than that. There is an opportunity to re-evaluate that. There are some communities that may be within a CMA but are inherently and objectively rural communities. I have said that before and will continue to say it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933511">The rural rebate provided for constituents outside of those CMAs could be examined and could be increased, and not because rural Canadians do not want to be a part of the fight on climate change. We have to make sure there is a difference between the lived realities in urban and rural areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933512">On affordability of home heating, I want to note that this government put $118 million into Atlantic Canada in October. We have not heard one single mention of that from the Conservative benches. It is a program that makes a difference on energy efficiency, and it is a program that makes a difference on home heating oil usage. It is good for the environment, but particularly to the intent of this bill, it is really important for affordability. There was not one word mentioned on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933513">There has to be more time for those programs to work out, and I made it very clear that I hope the government will consider exempting or otherwise indemnifying individuals until such time that the merits of that program to help people get transitioned off can be in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933514">The last thing I would say is we need to continue to focus on the supply side with, for example, EV charging stations and maybe perhaps more of an emphasis on the heat pump program. I have talked to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278121" Type="2">Long Range Mountains</Affiliation>, and I know in Newfoundland and Labrador there is some work that has to be done on electricity upgrades to ensure the heat pumps can actually function and we can move forward. However, this is all really good for focusing on affordability and also tackling the issue of climate change. That is my proposition, which is that it is not mutually exclusive. These things need to happen at the same time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933515">I want to go to Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>. The Conservatives are going to roll their eyes because I have been at them over the last week, but I am still perplexed as to why the Conservative Party of Canada, the official opposition in this country, is opposing a bill that is supported by the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Premier of Nova Scotia, the clean energy sector, indigenous communities and business stakeholders. We are engaging with fisheries, and I say that because I can image the member for <Affiliation DbId="278784" Type="2">Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame</Affiliation> is going to ask about the fisheries. They are extremely important stakeholders who deserve to be and are part of that conversation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933516">Everyone is on board, this is the way to enable it, yet Conservatives stand in opposition. They have something to answer to Atlantic Canadians on that question because they are standing against the interests of Atlantic Canadians. They talk about the technology, the future of renewable energy in Atlantic Canada, not taxes, but they will not even let the technology drive forward. It is so hypocritical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933517">I have really enjoyed engaging in this. I cannot wait for questions. I am going to move quickly so we can get as many members in as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933518">To conclude, carbon pricing is an initiative that is implemented around the world to help create a mechanism to drive change. This government is focused on investing on the supply side to help people make that change. We have made sure, in the way the program is designed, that money goes back disproportionately to households to help protect them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933519">I have talked about the statistics, and about how much carbon pricing, according to the Bank of Canada and according to economists in the National Post, a paper I hope the Conservatives read, is contributing very little to the overall things they are talking about here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933520">I have explained my position on carbon pricing. I believe in the intent. I believe in the inherent nature of why we are doing this. However, I am calling for adjustments. I stand here proud, as an Atlantic Canadian member of Parliament, recognizing that, for the constituents I represent, the national program needs to be adjusted to better reflect their reality. I am offering solutions. I look across the way, and I see very little in terms of solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933521">On a bill that represents billions of dollars to Atlantic Canada's economy, let us forget the fact that this represents an ability to decarbonize our electricity grid and perhaps provide power to my good friends over in Quebec through Atlantic Canada. This is about jobs, prosperity and great economic opportunities for communities. The Conservatives continue to stand against that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933522">I look forward to a member of Parliament from the Conservative caucus of Newfoundland and Labrador or Nova Scotia getting up and going on the record here today and explaining to their constituents why they are standing in the way of billions of dollars of opportunities, and I think I am going to get that answer right now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933533">Madam Speaker, I said this earlier today, as I have been in this chamber all day today, and I think that the motion that has been put forward is frankly a fundraising opportunity for the Conservatives. They are not treating this seriously. They are not interested in engaging seriously in debate on how to make this program work for Canadians and how to actually meaningfully address climate change. Therefore, I am going to ask the member about his speech and about how we could fix a carbon program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933534">In my province of Alberta, Rachel Notley brought in the very first one, the carbon levy, and it was highly successful. One of the things that it did was actually contribute to reducing our carbon footprint by including things such as billions of dollars in investment into transport and billions of dollars in rebates so that folks could put solar panels on their homes and retrofit our homes. There was millions of dollars that went to developing bio-energy and millions of dollars that went for methane reduction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933535">I wonder whether the member would be interested in looking at a carbon levy or a carbon tax that would be used to reduce our carbon footprint and meaningfully deal with the climate emergency.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7933536">Madam Speaker, that is an important question. What I heard from my hon. colleague is that she understands the importance of a price signal and the importance of carbon pricing and recognizing that, whether in her home province of Alberta or one of the other 76 jurisdictions around the world, this is seen as a really important way to be able to support the fight on climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933537">I agree with the member's comments that we have to construe this policy in a way that is fair and equitable to all parts of the country. As I said in my remarks here today, I would like to see a higher rural rebate. I would like to see some thought given around the home heating question in Atlantic Canada, where 40% of our households still rely on home heating. The government has put really good programs in place. There is the $118 million that I mentioned, which would be very similar to the transit piece that the member mentioned in Alberta. However, those programs need time to get out, and we have to balance the affordability question versus environment. They go hand in hand, so I think of any of these.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933538"> I would really welcome a mature and responsible debate instead of some of the mudslinging I see. To be fair, there are some Conservative members on the other side who stand up to provide credible positions, but far too much that I have heard in this debate today is just information that is not factually correct. We have to be better as parliamentarians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933539">Madam Speaker, we have cited a few headlines, and here is one that came out four hours ago in the National Post: “Most Canadians want carbon tax reduced or killed: poll”. The articles says, and this is astonishing, “While Alberta typically charts as the most anti-carbon tax jurisdiction in Canada, this time it was Atlantic Canada”, where 50 per cent of respondents want the carbon tax completely eliminated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933540">The hon. member talked about three cents. In my province of New Brunswick, carbon tax 2 was eight cents plus HST, but we are dealing with numbers that people do not see. Between my province of New Brunswick and Maine, the carbon tax shows just how big the gap in gas prices is. Pump prices in the state of Maine are 50¢ per litre less than they are in New Brunswick. That is all taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933545">On the isthmus, we are there with 50%. As I said on Radio-Canada this week, if the courts indeed determine that this is a purely federal responsibility, we will be there with 100% of the cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933546">I stand here asking for adjustments to the carbon price. The member opposite suggests that carbon pricing should not exist in Canada, contrary to the fact that 77 jurisdictions around the world point to this as being an effective policy. Beyond that, the Conservatives have provided no credible plan on how they are going to challenge and address the issue before us. Therefore, the member has some explaining to do as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933547">On Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>, so that when the member clips this and sends it home to his constituents, this is a generational opportunity for Atlantic Canada for offshore wind. The premiers of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador want it. The member stands against it. He needs to go home and explain why he is standing in the way of billions of dollars of generational opportunity, especially when the line from the Conservatives is “technology, not taxes”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933548">Last, with respect to the 50-cent difference between Maine and New Brunswick, if he goes to Maine, I am sure he will find that there is a 50-cent difference between the price of milk in Maine and in New Brunswick. There are a lot of price differentials. He is tying this exactly to what we are talking about today, which is not necessarily a true reflection of the fact that there is a price differential between Canada and the U.S. on a number of products. Maybe he is saying that he does not want to support the dairy farmers in New Brunswick and across this country and that he wants to get rid of supply management, which we have seen from the Conservative Party. It has not been strong on that policy that matters for rural Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933549">Madam Speaker, I am sharing my time this afternoon with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278382" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933550">It is always an honour to rise in the House of Commons to speak on behalf of my constituents of Peterborough—Kawartha and of all Canadians. I am the shadow minister for families, children and social development, and I have been pretty vocal in my cry of the mental health crisis across this country, in particular for our kids. They are not doing okay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933551">Today, what we are going to talk about in the House directly impacts our children. Today is an opposition motion day put forth by our leader, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation>. An opposition motion has been put forth by us. We are the official opposition; we are not in government. We do not get to set the agenda and we do not get to set policy. We are here as opposing members to bring balance to the government. The problem is that we do not have just the Liberals in power; we have an NDP-Liberal coalition that signed a deal that is deeply hurting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933552">The opposition motion that was put forward today and that we are debating in the House is that “the House call on the government to introduce legislation, within seven days of this motion being adopted, to repeal all carbon taxes to bring home lower prices on gas, groceries, and home heating”. My Conservative colleagues can applaud for that. It is a very important piece of legislation and will give members an idea, when the vote happens, where the members of the House stand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933553">The reality is that there are very real consequences to decisions and policies made in the House, and there are very real consequences to taxing fuel, which is what the carbon tax is doing. When we tax fuel that a farmer needs to run his tractors on his field or to take care of his animals, we are then going to have to transfer that tax to the trucker, who is going to have move that food. We are then going to have to tax the manufacturer of the food. Members can guess who ends up paying that compounded price. It is Canadians, the people at home watching this. What happens to their hard-earned paycheque? It falls out of their hand like sand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933554">I asked last night, through my social media channels, to hear from my constituents, because that is what we are elected to do in the House. We are elected to listen to and be the voice of our ridings. There are about 115,000 people in my riding of Peterborough—Kawartha. We are a bellwether riding, which means we are reflective of the entire country. We are a bit of a microcosm of what happens in Canada. I asked people to share their stories with me of how the carbon tax is impacting their lives, and I asked if I could read those into the record, so that is what I am going to do right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933555">I am going to start with Shannon Montgomery Sundberg, who writes that she does not even know where to start. She is a business owner and needs fuel for everything. She needs truck parts, plow parts, machinery, oils and insurance. Her customers are not able to pay what they owe, because their own families are struggling. Shannon says that she cannot afford to hire extra help; there is not enough work to keep the business going. The lack of income is starting to affect her mental health, for which, she says, there is no help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933556">Shannon writes, “It is so much more than carbon tax. It is a whole broken system. Ontarians are being forced out.” They feel that the government does not want them, and that it “should be helping its people, not stomping on them while they are down.” She says divisions created by the government make her cry almost daily. Everywhere she looks, she sees people in difficulty. As a mother of four grown children, who have spouses and children of their own, Shannon says that she worries every day about the cost of healthy food. She asks, “Can you imagine as a mother not being able to offer good healthy food to your kids and their kids because you are trying to hold on yourself?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933557">Shannon calls herself “a very proud Canadian”, but she nonetheless has a “disgusting feeling” towards the whole government. She writes, “Every single person under our Prime Minister has had every opportunity to walk away and/or speak up. We the people voted the Government in and we the people should be able to say enough is enough. We want a Government for the people.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933558"> Chad writes, “We live in a rural part of Ontario. With the current fuel prices, to fill my truck and SUV for my wife and I for one week is about $325. We spent $500 last week on groceries as we have a family of 5; [that is] $825 in one week for groceries and fuel.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933559"> Carol Anne Grant writes that their power bill for one month is now $400. With the cost of heating their home, she says, their whole pension goes to paying household bills, with nothing left for groceries. Stats from Food Bank Canada say that seven million people are not able to feed themselves and that 1.5 million people a month are using food banks. These are people with jobs. That is what is happening across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933560">This next message comes from Jeff Dunk, who writes that he works for a trucking company and that there are drivers sitting at home. There is not enough work because people do not want to pay the current rates for transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933561"> Erica's message is pretty profound, as all of them are. Erica writes, “My husband and myself work decent paying jobs (combined over $100,000) and we have two kids. We rent our two bedroom home and have two vehicles. I run out of money two days after pay day.” One of their children is diabetic. She says, “the cost of groceries is ridiculous. I am spending about $400 every two weeks to feed my kids.” That means that the hydro bill is not getting paid, or sometimes they pay just enough to keep the lights on. Sometimes the heating gas bill is not getting paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933562">Erica goes on to ask, “How is it that a family making over $100,000 a year can't be comfortable? We are just as broke as we were when we were barely making $50,000 a year combined.” She has worked hard and finally has a wage she always dreamed of, yet she says, “I am getting nowhere. I am stuck in the small rental because I can't afford the rent for anywhere else. I am penny pinching for two weeks to make it to next pay day. I am tired. I feel defeated. It is no wonder mental health has become a crisis. Trudeau is to blame for that.”</ParaText>

We know this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933565">We can look at the Children First study that came out in August. This is an incredible organization that does studies. This is what is happening to children in our country. Food insecurity in children is up 29%. Canada ranks 30th out of 38 in the OECD for child well-being. Canada ranks 81st out of 193 countries on the global KidsRights Index, which is down from 48th in 2022. Listen to this one: Suicide is a leading cause of death in children. Yes, this is linked to the carbon tax because the most compassionate thing someone can do as a leader is make life affordable. That is what we need in this country.</ParaText>

The cost of child care was way too high. Jennifer's husband works the night shift at a logistics warehouse of a major grocery corporation. As long as he has worked there, there has never been such a slowdown, especially considering it is the week before Thanksgiving. They are cramming more orders onto fewer trucks. Because stores are selling less, orders are smaller and less frequent, and production is down to a third of the usual. Jennifer writes, “Hero workers who worked their asses off during Covid are now getting slapped in the face right before Christmas with layoffs and jobs lost; that is what the carbon tax has done to my family.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933592">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow my friend, the formidable MP for <Affiliation DbId="278557" Type="2">Peterborough—Kawartha</Affiliation>. We come from different parts of the country and different backgrounds, but as are all Conservatives in our big, growing movement, we are united with our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> to fight to axe the carbon tax; to bring down food and fuel prices, as well as heating and cooling costs for all Canadians; to build homes Canadians can afford; and to bring jobs, money, businesses, natural resource development and exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933593">Conservatives will bring project approvals up and the cost of traditional energy down. We will green-light green technology and ensure major projects and infrastructure can get built in this country again, so all Canadians can have accessible, affordable, reliable fuel and power, and, most importantly, hope for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933594">Our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> and Conservatives warned the NDP-Liberal government repeatedly during the past eight years that its reckless tax, spending and inflationary deficit agenda would drive investment out of Canada and make everything more expensive for everyone. Only a few months after I was elected as the MP to represent the people of Lakeland, in response to the 2016 budget, even I warned of the dangers of this regressive, repressive tax. Before the Liberals imposed it, I said then, which is clearly true today, that the carbon tax was just a revenue generator for government to feed reckless spending and out-of-control deficits masquerading as environmental policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933595">However, the NDP-Liberals have traded on all Canadians' deep concern and care for the environment to cover their obvious cash grab. The proof is in the most difficult ways. Almost a decade into their irresponsible, harmful experiment, it has been all economic pain and no environmental gain for Canadians. Of course, the MP who predicted everything about the consequences of the NDP-Liberal agenda was our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, in his previous role as the official opposition finance shadow minister. What is remarkable is that he also warned of the risks and costs back in 2007, 16 years ago, of the Liberals' plan to implement a carbon tax, which he warned would cost everyday Canadians thousands of dollars that they would not be able to afford. He has always opposed it, and we still do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933596">In terms of inflation, rising interest rates and the skyrocketing prices for essentials such as gas, groceries and home heating, Conservatives warned about the connections of all these policies. We warned that the dreams of new and young Canadians would be compromised and undermined by the NDP-Liberal policies that always do, in real terms, the very opposite of what they claim. The NDP-Liberals like to say that they do not take lessons from Conservatives or our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, but they really should have. It would have saved all Canadians years of struggles, bankruptcies, foreclosures, anxiety, catastrophic losses of generational opportunities, hundreds of thousands of job losses, billions in investments and a brain drain to other countries, allies and foes alike. It is a tragic hindsight, and it is obvious that they really should have listened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933597">Canadians remember the Liberals' main 2015 promise that they would help the middle class and those working hard to join it, but the facts are stark, and these are pesky things for politicians such as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who do not keep their word or take responsibility. As the Prime Minister has been in power for almost a decade, it is time for him to answer for it. The truth is that, under the previous Conservative government, more Canadian kids and vulnerable families were lifted out of poverty than at any other time in the history of our country, and Canada's middle class became the richest middle class of any country on earth in 2014. At that time, it really was sunny skies ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933598">What has happened today? The Liberals have moved the way their government measures the poverty line to pretend their policies have worked. The middle class is dwindling, because the vast majority of Canadians cannot pay their bills or cover their essential costs, and more Canadians are falling behind after eight years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933599">The truth is that there is no honest way to skirt the fact that the NDP-Liberals' carbon taxes have very real, punitive and burdensome impacts on everyday Canadians. In Lakeland, the NDP-Liberals' carbon tax will cost people nearly $4,000 a year in the next six years. The consequence is that Canadians everywhere, not just in Lakeland, are struggling to make ends meet, to put food on the table, to fuel their vehicles, and to heat and cool their homes and businesses. In the vast majority of our country there are just no other immediately available and affordable options for Canadians. They are left with no choice. They are squeezed by all sides, and it is at a breaking point after eight years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his NDP-Liberal policies. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933600">The Liberals can spin it all they want. They can dig in and stubbornly justify their harmful agenda, but the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer confirms what we warned, that the NDP-Liberal carbon tax hikes the cost of literally everything. This is why 80% of Canadians pay more than they will ever get back from the Liberals, exactly as we said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933601">The independent PBO also found that the tax has not actually reduced emissions since it was imposed. It is a cash grab. It is not a bug, an accident or an unintended consequence. It is a feature of their agenda. The Liberals themselves admitted that their carbon tax is meant to make driving more expensive, and they are plowing ahead to quadruple those costs and add a second carbon tax on top of it. Together, those taxes would hike prices at the pumps by 61¢ a litre in the next seven years. Seriously, who could afford this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933602">There is no light at the end of the tunnel for most Canadians under these NDP-Liberals, who are totally out of touch. Now, exactly as we warned, Canadians are out of money. Canadians are not sitting around hoping the government that claims it is here to help would make it totally impossible for them to afford to drive and heat their homes, but this is actually exactly what the NDP-Liberals and Bloc want to do and are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933603">As we warned, it is mostly hurting the working poor, people on fixed incomes, rural and remote Canadians, indigenous communities and, especially, people in rural regions in the west and Atlantic Canada. This is because of the differences in the realities of the various regions and provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933604">Canadians in our biggest cities can hardly even afford to rent a single room in a single house. That alone is thousands of dollars. They cannot keep up with interest rate hikes caused by soaring inflationary deficit spending, which are pushing their rent and mortgages out of reach. We also warned about this in 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933605"> It is not a pleasure, at all, to tell the NDP-Liberals that we told them so, because of all the pain, anger and anxiety they have caused. However, they also cannot pretend that Conservatives did it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933606"> Colinton is a village of 170 people near Athabasca, in a beautiful area where the landscape shifts to rolling hills and more lakes, giving way to the treasured and beautiful boreal forest that spans throughout northern Alberta. Gordie from Colinton wrote to me and said that his daughter and her husband have four kids, and here is the crucial and horrible part that would be familiar to most Canadians: They both have well-paying jobs. However, by the time they pay rent, gas, power and heating, the family has to skimp on groceries or choose to not pay some bills. As we all know, this often ends up in a spiral people cannot escape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933607">This is not just happening in Lakeland.

The consequences are that Canadians cannot cover the basics. They cannot afford to eat. What is this for?</ParaText>

Energy security, self-sufficiency and sustainability dictate the price of food and the standard of living, which is a crucial thing for this country to secure that has absolutely languished and been lost, I fear generationally, under the NDP-Liberals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933634">Madam Speaker, it has been quite a day. We have heard a lot of different things. I will do my best to remain calm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933635">For starters, the Conservatives wonder why we do not adopt their motions, why we do not vote in favour of most of them. I will tell them, quite honestly, that it is because most of their motions are rigged. Most of their motions contain inaccuracies. Then, they get offended when we say they are not telling the truth. We are here to serve the public interest; we are not here to pass anything and everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933636">It is interesting, because our party is mentioned in the motion. During question period today, I even saw members of the official opposition asking questions of the Bloc Québécois. I found that very interesting. Perhaps they see an independent Quebec in the future, with some of us in government. I found that amusing, so I just wanted to point it out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933637">The motion states that the Bloc Québécois supported and adopted the clean fuel regulations with the Liberal government. It also refers to the Liberal-Bloc coalition. It is rather funny, though, because coalitions change from one week to the next in this Parliament. Sometimes we hear about the Liberal-NDP coalition. Sometimes the Conservatives also move motions that make sense, and we support them. When that happens, the Liberals talk about the Bloc-Conservative coalition. It changes all the time, so it is super entertaining. I invite people at home to do a survey on this and compile the statistics to see which coalition is the most frequent. Clearly, it is a bit ridiculous to make these accusations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933638">Today's motion states almost verbatim that the Bloc supported the clean fuel regulations. I often tell my constituents that it is very important for the Bloc Québécois to be present in the federal Parliament, even if our political party will never be in power, because we have a great deal of influence. That said, I did not think our influence was that significant, since regulations are adopted by the government. We do not vote on regulations, so when the Conservatives say that we passed those regulations, it is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933639">If it upsets the Conservatives when we tell them that it is a lie, then what can we say? I will go back to what I was saying. On top of that, these clean fuel regulations will have no impact on Quebec because the Government of Quebec already has regulations that call for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 15% by 2030. That is what it says in the regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933640">We are not the ones who adopted the clean fuel regulations and we never supported them. What is more, these regulations will make no difference to Quebeckers' wallets. What I am saying is serious because they have been repeating this all day long. Repeating a lie a million times does not make it true. Actually, it depends on the lie. For a year now the Conservatives have been saying that the Liberal government has been in power for eight years. When they started saying that it had been only seven years. It was therefore not true. In a month it will be eight years, at which point it will be true. I am not sure if that will work for the other lies, but it works for this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933641">We are here to work for the people and to try to move forward on issues. Some will say I am a dreamer, but I want to quote John Lennon. I just had a flash. There is a line in the song <I>Imagine</I> that goes like this:<Poetry OriginalReceived="True"><Verse><Line>You may say I'm a dreamer</Line><Line>But I'm not the only one</Line></Verse></Poetry></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933642">As a parliamentarian, I dream of the day when election campaigns last a month and a half or two months instead of three or four years; in the interval, we would work for the common good. I invite my Conservative colleagues to watch sittings from the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. I think we manage to work well together, and I am very proud of that. I have said it several times before in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933643">I try to bring the same attitude here. In that spirit, I will not start calling this or that member a liar. Instead, I will state that what was said is not true. Some might say that it is the same thing, but at least I will not use unparliamentary language. At least there is that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933644">The Bloc Québécois did not adopt the clean fuel regulations. I hope they make a clip of what I just said. The carbon tax does not apply in Quebec. I hope they make a clip of that, too. Quebec has an emissions trading system that was established with California and that is still in force. The system was set up in 2013, if I am not mistaken. That date is just off the top of my head. It may have been a little more recent than that. Actually, forget I mentioned the date. This system was adopted prior to the carbon tax and is advantageous for Quebeckers. It is estimated that it adds 8.8¢ to the price of a litre of gasoline in Quebec, compared with 14.3¢ for the carbon tax. That definitely means we are at an advantage, not a disadvantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933645">When the Conservative members from Quebec strongly denounce the carbon tax, accuse the mean old Bloc of costing Quebeckers a lot of money and say that, if they take office, they will repeal the carbon tax and put money directly back in Quebeckers' pockets, it is not true. Quebec's emissions trading system will remain in effect even if the Conservatives repeal the carbon tax that applies in other provinces. It is important to point that out. When I rise in the House, I will always make it my duty to clearly and calmly set the record straight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933646">We said that the Conservatives were proposing simplistic solutions. Earlier, a member quoted our use of the word “simplistic” and said that the Conservatives' solution was indeed simple because it would put money back in Quebeckers' pockets. The word “simplistic” actually means something that seems simple but is actually ineffective and poorly thought out, something that does not actually solve the problem. With all due respect, I would invite the Conservatives to look up the definition of the word “simplistic” so that they know for next time. Perhaps they should stop trying to exploit opposition to climate change and the cost of living for their own political gain. It is true that the cost of living is high and that that is very serious, but there are other places where the government can find money. Oil companies are making outrageous profits. We talked about that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933647">At the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, we studied inflation at the grocery store and made some recommendations. One of them, of course, was about the need to determine the breakdown of the profits being made by the major grocery chains, which constitute an oligopoly. The five major grocery chains control 80% of the market. We are hearing a lot today about the price of gas. Funnily enough, the oil companies are also an oligopoly. As far as gas is concerned, we know how much money those companies are making. As far as the grocery sector is concerned, we do not know. What we are saying is that we need this information to determine what action the government can take, because concrete measures will have to be taken to help our agri-food businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933648">There is one thing that boggles my mind when it comes to the fight against climate change. It is hearing some people say that we need to produce oil and build pipelines, without taking climate change into account, because they expect that this will lower the cost of living. I urge my colleagues to talk to vegetable farmers, particularly in Quebec, but also elsewhere. Some had to deal with torrential rains all summer long. Of course, we cannot always make a direct scientific link between a particular season and global warming. However, I could also mention forest fires, more frequent hurricanes and a whole host of other events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933649">We cannot link each element directly, but we can see that the frequency is higher, that the climate disruptions are substantial and that it is costing money. It is not true that climate change does not cost money. It is costing us a tremendous amount of money. This summer, the forest fires cost us $8 billion, and that does not even take the long-term effects into account. Just think of the cost of insurance. There will come a day when the companies will no longer want to insure people who live in fire-prone areas. That is important as well. As far as insurance is concerned, can we determine together how to share the cost of the risk factor with farmers in order to maintain food production for the future? Keeping food production local and not relying on foreign companies that can raise prices overnight could also bring down the cost of living.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933682"> Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> is important to me, but it is very important to the communities that we all represent: CNIB, Fighting Blindness and all of those organizations plus all of the people who are suffering from blindness and vision problems, and I know that there are many in this room itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933683">Now that I have managed to get the bill to third reading, I want to begin by thanking all members for getting it that far, and I hope that this is the last time that I am speaking to it. Maybe we can get this bill eventually moved over to the Senate and get the work done there that needs to be done that will improve vision for thousands and thousands of Canadians. There are many MPs who have vision loss or vision problems themselves, and I am hoping that a nationalized strategy will bring all of the partners together as we move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933684"> October starts next week. In October we will be celebrating Children's Vision Month and I am honoured to be able to speak to you all today, on the eve of this occasion, about my bill, Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, establishing a national strategy for eye care. I trust that again together, because we do not do anything alone and it takes all of us, we will be able to move this forward and get the House's support for Bill C-284 in the third reading stage to help children reach their full potential with good eye health and vision care. We cannot let the blur obscure children's future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933685">As early as 2003, the Canadian government made a commitment to the World Health Organization to develop a vision health plan for Canada by 2007 and implement this plan by 2009. Just to remind members, we are at 2023. The vision loss community has been waiting for a very long time to see Canada take some steps when it comes to a national eye care strategy, but Canada has lacked any substantive framework on the matter of public eye health care to this day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933686">When I started to look closer at the issue, it was clear to me that it has to be changed. We have taken tremendous steps forward in improving the health of Canadians with the promise of national pharmacare and most recently a plan to implement national dental care. The introduction of a strategy to improve vision care is another critical step in this direction. It is worth reminding members that, in 2021, the Canadian Council of the Blind in partnership with Fighting Blindness Canada, the Canadian Ophthalmological Society and the Canadian Association of Optometrists, with support of other organizations, commissioned a study on the cost of vision loss in Canada. The study revealed that Canada is experiencing an emerging crisis in avoidable vision loss that has the potential to get even worse unless action is taken immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933687">Members might well be aware of those striking numbers: Over eight million Canadians have an eye disease; 1.2 million live with vision loss or blindness; and 1,292 deaths were associated with vision loss in 2019 alone. There is a high percentage of seniors and school-age children who have undiagnosed eye problems. The study suggests that without changes in public policy, the number of Canadians living with a blinding eye disease will increase to up to 14 million Canadians by 2050. Meanwhile, 75% of vision loss can be prevented, and prevention is the key. Establishing a national eye care strategy would ensure that Canadians' vision health is prioritized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933688">We all take our vision for granted. It is only when we start to find that we cannot see as well as we used to or as well as we would like to that we start to maybe pay attention by checking the last time we had an eye exam, and making sure that we are taking good care of our eyes as we take care of other parts of our body. Unfortunately, we often do not until it is much too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933689">There are so many challenges when one cannot see, from social isolation to depression to travel difficulties. Vision loss has a profound loss on individuals, their families and society, costing our economy an estimated $32.9 billion a year. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933690">I will just repeat that number: The cost because of vision loss is $32.9 billion a year. Over half of that cost is attributed to the reduced quality of life primarily due to loss of independence, especially in the aging population. Another $4 billion is attributed to reduced productivity in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933691">Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, when passed, would commit the government to a national strategy, a framework dedicated to improved access to eye care and rehabilitation services, a strategy that also envisions the creation of a vision desk at the Public Health Agency of Canada and investments in research to find new treatments to prevent and stop blindness. The bill is also calling on an enhanced access to eye health care for indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933692">Our eyesight is precious. Without it, we are bound in countless ways: physically, socially, cognitively and more. The impacts of blindness include an increased risk of financial hardship, as well as the inability to drive, read, participate in physically activity or socially interact with others, which can often lead to depression and other mental illnesses. Improving eye health would contribute to improved well-being and unlock human potential for everyone. I invite my colleagues to join me on this mission to protect this valuable sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933693">Making eye health, vision care and rehabilitation services a health priority requires members' support. I encourage all who are here today to become champions for Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> in their own areas and refer it to the Senate as soon as possible so we might all be able to celebrate it as the law of the land sooner rather than later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933694">Again, I call on all my colleagues in the House to please support Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> in its third reading today, on the eve of the Children's Vision Month of October, which is to help children reach their full potential with good eye health and vision care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933695">To my colleagues, I thank them very much. I appreciate getting to the third reading. The best thing tonight would be for the bill to collapse, go for a vote and have it move on to the Senate, but I am in my colleagues' hands as this debate progresses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933712">Madam Speaker, most of us take our eyes for granted until we have a problem with them. When we have a problem, it is not the time to be scrambling for solutions. That is why I support Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, the national eye care strategy act. I thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278356" Type="2">Humber River—Black Creek</Affiliation> for bringing this matter before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933713">One of the reasons I like this legislation is that it understands the need for co-operation in health care. It calls on the Minister of Health to establish a national strategy for eye care in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments, as well as indigenous leaders and other health care-related stakeholders. There are approximately eight million Canadians who suffer from some form of degenerative eye disease. That means one in five Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933714">Look around this chamber. Statistically, it is likely that 68 hon. members are afflicted by a degenerative eye disease. Sometimes people are not aware of it. It could be one of us. It could be me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933715">Fighting Blindness Canada, the largest charitable funder of vision research in Canada, estimates that 75% of eye disease cases are preventable in the event of early diagnosis. That is a sobering number and explains why we need a national eye care strategy. This afflicts one in five Canadians and in most cases is preventable. We would be derelict in our duty if we did not work to address this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933716">The most common eye diseases in Canada include macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. All of those can lead to blindness if not treated in time. The earlier the treatment, the better the chances of a positive outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933717">The bill calls for a national strategy to identify the training and educational needs of health care practitioners who specialize in ocular care; to promote improved research on prevention and treatment; to promote data sharing between the federal and provincial governments in relation to eye disease prevention; and to facilitate the rapid approval of new treatments used for eye disease. It is not that nothing is being done now; it is that we need to do more. That is why this bill calls upon the Minister of Health to take into consideration existing strategies directed at prevention and treatment of eye disease. A national approach taking into account what is already being done in the provinces should be of benefit to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933718">This is a health care issue, one that affects the quality of life of millions of Canadians. As I said earlier, we tend to take our eyes for granted. I can think of few things that are more terrifying than slowly going blind, but that is the reality many Canadians are facing, and we have the opportunity in this House to do something about it. If we are serious about health care, then we should be serious about eye care, as our eyes are vitally important to our health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933719">As well as being a health issue, this is a financial issue. Fighting Blindness Canada estimates that preventable blindness in Canada costs about $33 billion each year, as the hon. member said earlier. That includes $9.5 billion in direct health care costs, $6.1 billion in indirect health care costs and $17.4 billion for the cost of well-being. Admittedly, this is not as much money as the Liberal deficit, but it is still a staggering amount when we stop to think about it. That is the cost of eye disease that could be prevented through early detection and treatment, something that would be enhanced by having a national eye care strategy as outlined in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933720">Vision loss will usually have a negative impact on an individual's financial health. Along with that comes a loss of independence and reduced quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933721">Canada's population is aging, and many eye diseases are age-related. That means the number of individuals living with vision loss is growing. Those numbers will increasingly impact Canada's health system and economy, so it is important that we act now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933722">It is important, as the bill states, to “identify the needs of health care professionals for training and guidance on the prevention and treatment of eye disease and to vision rehabilitation;” to “promote research and improve data collection on eye disease prevention and treatment and on vision rehabilitation”; and to “promote information and knowledge sharing between the federal and provincial governments in relation to eye disease prevention and treatment and to vision rehabilitation”. We have the ability to make this a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933723">Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> also calls for the designation of the month of February as “Age-Related Macular Degeneration Awareness Month”. I also support that. This designation has been used in other countries as a way to bring the issue to a wider audience. In so many cases of eye disease, prevention starts with awareness. By concentrating on the issue for the month of February, more Canadians will become aware of the eye issues they may face as they age and what can be done in terms of prevention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933724">All of us age, although most of us cannot imagine what things will look like when we are older. We may think that macular degenerative eye disease is going to happen to someone else and not to us. However, the truth is that it affects too many Canadians. If a person does not suffer from it, probably someone in their family or a close friend or colleague will. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933725">The experts tell me that macular degeneration occurs most often in people over 60 years old, and Canada does have an aging population problem. What is a problem now will only grow larger as the rest of the baby boomer generation moves into retirement. Age is a big factor when it comes to degenerative eye disease. A person in their 50s has about a 2% chance of getting age-related macular degeneration. By the time they reach 75, their chance is about one in three. Yet, as I said, most macular degeneration issues can be prevented with early recognition and treatment, which is why a month spent raising awareness of this issue is so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933726">Losing one's eyesight is terrifying to contemplate. Vision loss is an issue that literally affects millions of Canadians. We have the ability to do something to prevent it. There is no reason to delay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933727">I support Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, the national strategy for eye care act. We need to do what we can to protect the health of Canadians. I encourage members to support the bill. </ParaText>

I cannot be with them, but they will see that the work we are doing in the House of Commons is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933729">I want to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="278356" Type="2">Humber River—Black Creek</Affiliation> for her initiative. Hats off to her. She is the member behind Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C‑284</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933730">We talked about this earlier. I note that the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the NDP and also the Bloc Québécois agree on this bill. Therefore, I think the time has come to move forward, and we are getting there. Tonight, it is nice to have a calm atmosphere, so we can listen to each other. Some people may be falling asleep but, that said, this is an important subject. Everyone has been earning their keep these past few days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933731">The current bill is similar to several bills that have been introduced in recent parliaments. I am thinking about bills on autism, cancer and diabetes. These bills are designed to raise public awareness of these illnesses, both in terms of prevention and education. We know very well that prevention is necessary and the key to a healthy world. Whether through sport, diet or healthy lifestyle choices, we can work towards having a healthier population and thus put less pressure on the health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933732">However, prevention also involves raising awareness and providing information. We are not all specialists who know everything about every disease. That is understandable. We do, however, need to be vigilant about our own health. That goes without saying. It is all about taking prevention into our own hands. That said, we also need to know how to detect symptoms and recognize when it is time to consult a health professional. No one wants to clog up the emergency room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933733">Millions of Canadians are suffering from eye disease. We know that. Eye health is important to our quality of life. We are therefore in favour of Bill C‑284 because it is not restrictive and does not interfere with Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction over health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933734">This bill requires the federal government to produce a report that will form the future Canadian strategy for eye health.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933740">I will share a story about a constituent. His name is Sylvain. His story will illustrate why Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> is important. His situation is a bit like mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933741">Sylvain is a man in his fifties. He works at a big bank. He is a very busy man. He has been wearing glasses for a number of years. Over time, he notices that his vision is not as keen as it used to be. He assumes that it is a natural part of the aging process. It seems to line up with his age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933742">Sylvain neglects to make an appointment with the optometrist because he is a busy man. He does not take the time to do it. He figures he will get his eyes tested someday and get a new prescription. When the time comes, he goes to his eye exam and he has to see the ophthalmologist. Unfortunately, the news is not good. He gets an alarming diagnosis: It is glaucoma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933743">Many people are familiar with this disease, which damages the optic nerve so that information is not properly transmitted from the eye to the brain. The way I explain it to people is that it is as if you woke up one morning and you feel as though you are looking through a straw. Sylvain was about to retire. He had plans. He was living in Montreal but was moving to the country, to the Laurentians, in my riding. He was planning to travel and go on bike rides. In the winter, he was planning to ski in the area. In the end, he had a lot less quality time and he had to set aside some of his plans.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933744">Because of the type of glaucoma that he had and the stage of the disease, it was too late for Sylvain. Even the drugs he was prescribed could not slow the disease's progression. It was really impossible, and that is why prevention is key. There is a lack of knowledge. This disease must be prevented. It is unacceptable that people like Sylvain and many other Quebeckers and Canadians are unable to recognize the warning signs, but we cannot blame them. At the same time, if people do know the signs, then they can take action. It is also not easy to get the right information. Some people even have trouble distinguishing between a cold and the flu, so imagine trying to tell the difference between glaucoma, astigmatism or another eye problem, and yet some eye diseases can be fatal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933745">I mentioned at the outset that I was once in a similar position. In my early forties—some would say it was not so long ago—my eyes were fine. All of a sudden, I felt my eyesight change. My eyesight had started to deteriorate as I got closer to 40, so I got my eyes checked out. I was told that I had early-stage glaucoma. I was shocked to think that I, at 40 years old, would need laser eye surgery to prevent glaucoma. I learned afterwards that it runs in my family. My colleagues can imagine how many people fall through the cracks and cannot get surgery, like Sylvain, who now sees the world as if he is looking through a straw. I was lucky. I did not even know what glaucoma was. Even while preparing this speech, I had to read up on the disease because I was not sure of the facts anymore. That shows how ill-equipped we are as a society to recognize the major symptoms of many diseases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933746">I am sure that many Quebeckers in the House will talk about this. I would like to remind my colleagues of an ad that ran on television. It was a major national campaign in Quebec known as Memo-mamo. Lise Dion, a well-known Quebec comedian, was featured in these ads, which urged women to book an appointment for a mammogram and get early cancer screening. More than 60,000 women in Quebec have registered with the Quebec breast cancer screening program. That is a record in 100 years of campaigning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933747">It took a major awareness and education campaign for Quebec to get a breast cancer prevention policy. Women are the ones who are most commonly diagnosed with this type of cancer, which has the highest survival rate if the screening detects it in time. The same goes for the example I gave of glaucoma. It takes money to run screening and prevention campaigns. The federal government needs to be able to conduct such health campaigns in Quebec. In order for the Quebec department of health to take the necessary measures to keep Quebeckers healthy—and let us not forget that health falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec—the federal government needs to understand that the bill is important and that the Bloc Québécois supports it. </ParaText>

I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278356" Type="2">Humber River—Black Creek</Affiliation> for introducing this important legislation, which addresses a long-neglected issue in our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933749">Above my desk in my office here in Ottawa is a portrait of Tommy Douglas. When I think about the impact that he has had on health care for Canadians, I often reflect on his saying this: “When we're talking about medical care we're talking about our sense of values.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933750"> Our New Democratic Party has been advocating for a comprehensive, public health care system since our founding convention in 1961, where it was affirmed: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933751">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Believing that a country's most precious possession is the health of its citizens, the New Party will introduce a National Health Plan, providing benefits to those who need them without regard to their ability to pay. The plan will cover a full range of services: medical, surgical, dental and optical treatment, as well as prescribed drugs and appliances.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933752">I am proud of the role that New Democrats have played in establishing our national health care, as well as recent work we have done to force the Liberal government to establish a national dental care program. We will continue to work toward a national pharmacare plan. I believe that it is also important to add eye care to our universal health care model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933753">In one of the richest countries in the world, it is shameful that millions of our fellow Canadians lack access to essential eye care. Over eight million Canadians live with an eye condition that puts them at significant risk of blindness. We know that, as the population continues to age, this number will only increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933754">Seventy per cent of existing vision impairments in Canada are estimated to be correctable with prescription glasses, yet not everyone who needs glasses can afford them. The impact this has on the independence and quality of life of individuals and their families is significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933755">In 2019, vision loss had a direct and indirect economic impact of $33 billion, a number that is expected to rise to $56 billion by 2050. I appreciate the comprehensiveness of this bill; in particular, it would identify the training, education and guidance needs of health care practitioners and other professionals related to the prevention and treatment of eye disease, including clinical, practical guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933756">It would also promote research and improve data collection on eye disease prevention and treatment. It would promote information and knowledge sharing between the federal and provincial governments in relation to eye disease prevention and treatment. It would ensure that Health Canada is able to rapidly consider new applications for treatments and devices used for macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933757">What is more, this bill designates February as age-related macular degeneration month, raising awareness and education about the most common cause of vision loss in individuals over 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933758">I want to take a moment here to recognize Hamilton Health Sciences, McMaster University, St. Joseph's Healthcare and the researchers at the Regional Eye Institute at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, who are currently undertaking one of the most comprehensive studies on the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration. This work will help us understand the prevalence of AMD among Canadians, and it could even provide us with valuable insight on the genetic and lifestyle risk factors linked to developing it, as well as treatments to slow vision loss in patients with AMD.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933759">The need for a national strategy is, in part, obvious, because it is the right thing to do. However, it is also needed because there currently exists an inequality and inadequacy of eye care services at the provincial level. For instance, most health guidelines recommend having an eye exam once a year for people aged six to 18 years or 65 years or older, as well as those with diabetes or an eye disease. However, Manitoba and Nova Scotia only insure eye exams every 24 months for all seniors. Ontario has ended free annual eye exams for seniors through the Ontario health insurance plan, so those who cannot afford to pay out-of-pocket for an eye exam are putting their health at risk. The different services provided by each province will lead to greater health inequalities for Canadians, solely because of where they happen to live. This clearly highlights the need for a national eye care strategy and the importance of having eye care fully covered by our health care system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933760">There is also a gender issue at stake. Women carry a greater burden of visual impairment. Recent studies show that one in four women is at risk of visual impairment compared to only one in eight men. In a society that claims to value gender equality, this disparity is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933761">As the NDP health critic and my colleague from Vancouver Kingsway pointed out, this legislation aligns with the NDP's long-standing commitment to universal public health care. It also echoes the excellent work of my NDP colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278160" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation>, who introduced Motion No. 86 this past May calling on the federal government to work toward a national strategy for eye and health care. New Democrats are not newcomers to this issue, Madam Speaker, as you of all people would well know. We are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with organizations like Fighting Blindness Canada, the Canadian Council of the Blind and the CNIB, which are leading the call for greater support for eye care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933762">In conclusion, I ask my colleagues across all parties to support Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>. Early detection and treatment of eye disease can prevent 75% of visual loss cases, but only if people have access to eye care. New Democrats believe that every Canadian has the right to live a full and productive life, and that must include quality eye care. Let us ensure that our public health care system finally covers us from head to toe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933764">I would like to begin, as my colleague before me did, by thanking my esteemed colleague, the hon. member for Humber River—Black Creek, for the extensive work she has done on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933765">I might dare to call myself a poster person of someone who has faced eye health care challenges since my early forties. Late detection of glaucoma with a delay in having it addressed caused me to go through a very complicated cataract surgery and then another surgery of the cataracts, so I had two cataract surgeries with two detached retinas back to back, followed by two glaucoma surgeries. Because of the medication, I then had to have a cornea replacement last year. That was all due to the late identification and treatment of the condition of glaucoma in my eyes. Unfortunately, all of them were in my right eye.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933766"> I dare to call myself a poster person for this bill, and once again, I thank the hon. member. I also thank the doctors who helped restore my eyesight to the level that it is now so that I can function. I would like to specifically highlight Dr. Amrahdyan, who is my ophthalmologist; Dr. Berger, who is my retina specialist; Dr. Berke, who is my glaucoma specialist; and Dr. Chiu, who is my cornea specialist. They all worked very successfully on restoring the health of my eye.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933767">That is all to say how important eye health is. The key part is about how important it is for it to be part of our overall health. Vision loss can have a massive impact on daily life. I could spend hours talking about the impact it had on me. Two back-to-back detached retinas basically meant that I had to lie flat on my face for 18 weeks, over two nine-week periods, without being able to move. That stopped me from eating something for more than five minutes. The rest of the time I was basically flat on my face, and I could not actively participate in any activity, whether it was work or family events or anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933768">It is important for us to make sure we really support this bill and work across the aisle to make sure that it passes to develop the strategy that is needed and embed it into the health care system. As Canada's population ages, the importance of maintaining good eye health and preventing vision loss is imperative. Vision loss can be caused by several common eye diseases, including macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. I am glad to say that I do not have diabetic retinopathy, but I unfortunately have to say that I have suffered through all of the others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933769">According to a report from Deloitte and the Canadian Council of the Blind, more than eight million Canadians had a common eye disease in 2019 and were at serious risk of losing their vision, as I was. Throughout a person's lifetime, and especially as they age, it is important to maintain good eye health. Routine vision care can help to reduce the risks of blindness and vision loss later in life and improve the outcomes associated with eye diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma. I cannot emphasize how important it is to ensure that everyone has access to an optometrist and an ophthalmologist and they go through routine eye examinations as early as they can.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933770">One's vision does not need to be impaired to see an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. People need to make sure their eyes are healthy and can continue functioning to have a quality life. This is why I am standing in the House today in support of Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, which would establish a national strategy for eye care to support the prevention and treatment of eye disease to ensure better health outcomes for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933771">This bill calls on the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to establish a national strategy in consultation with the provinces, territories, experts and indigenous groups. This strategy would allow governments at all levels across Canada to work together to address vision loss. Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> demonstrates to Canadians that we are all working to better support their eye health through a comprehensive and collaborative approach. A national strategy for eye care contributes to ensuring that Canadians are getting the vision services they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933772">The federal government's health portfolio is leading and supporting a range of activities related to eye disease prevention and treatment, in support of health care delivery, which is undertaken by the provinces and territories. I would like to spend a bit of time talking about some of the supports that the federal government is giving the provinces and territories around health care in general. We are hoping that some of them, through the provinces and territories, get directed to eye care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933773">As we all know, budget 2023 committed close to $200 billion in funding to support our health workforce; reduce backlogs; expand access to family health services, mental health and substance abuse; and modernize our health system. This includes $46.2 billion in new funding to be transferred directly to the provinces and territories through new Canada health transfer measures, as well as tailored bilateral agreements to meet the needs of each province and territory, personal support, work wage support and territorial health investment. As we all know, $25 billion of that is focused on what we call the shared priorities between the provinces and the federal government. My plea to all levels of government, including my own government, is that some of that shared funding be focused on eye health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933774">Addressing health workforce shortages and surgical backlogs, including for vision-related surgeries, is a key part of the plan and is a health system priority for this government. I was really fortunate to be able to get immediate support when I went through back-to-back detached retinas. That is considered an emergency. However, I had to wait more than three months to get scheduled for a cornea transplant. I would like to once again thank Dr. Chu for doing such an amazing job in helping to restore my sight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933775">The Government of Canada recognizes that supporting research is key to a fulsome understanding of eye health, including how to prevent vision loss. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research has supported key vision-related research that has strengthened the evidence base. Health Canada also regulates drugs and medical devices, including those intended for eye diseases and conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933776">Finally, the government fully supports Canada's public health system, which provides coverage for any vision care services that must be performed in a hospital. There are those who have glaucoma and they receive special consideration when they visit a doctor. However, those who do not have it have to pay for the services when they go to their ophthalmologist or optometrist. I am hoping that some of this shared priority focuses on making sure those services are provided as part of the health care system. The efforts to protect Canadians' vision in the long term is something that all members and all Canadians would benefit from and stand behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933777">Once again, I wish to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278356" Type="2">Humber River—Black Creek</Affiliation> for putting forward this bill meaningful bill.

              <ParaText id="7933786">There is a reason I love this bill so much. When we look at our health, let us be honest: Nothing else matters in the world other than our health. Someone does not know they do not have health until they do not have health. I always say it is like that age-old adage: When someone is sick and laying on the ground with the flu or something, they could have all the money in the world and all the possessions in the world, but without their health they cannot do anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933787">What I like about this bill is that it puts a focus not only on our eyes, but on the overall health of our eyes and the impact our eye health has on us. It also talks about prevention, and that is the smart economics, I would say, of this bill. When we look at prevention, that is really when we are working upstream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933788">Often in this House, what we are doing is intervening. The damage has already been done and we are doing an intervention, constantly. We are doing damage control all the time. We see this in so many aspects, such as our mental health crisis and our opioid crisis. We are trying to undo all of these things. However, if we focus on prevention and research, we will save ourselves so much money in the long run. I like that this bill has a specific focus on research and prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933789">There is an area about this bill that intrigued me and got me thinking. I am the shadow minister or critic for children, families and social development. We have a ton of children in this country who are not reaching their full potential in learning. Something is often overlooked, and I can remember my own experience of this with my kids when things were not working out at school or something was going on. The simplest thing we can do is check to see if their vision is working, if their eyes are working. People do not know any different. If someone's eyes are not working, but they have never had them tested and do not know any different, that is what their baseline is. They do not know that they cannot see the board or cannot see their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933790">There could be a whole bunch of kids acting up or their behaviour has changed or they are not reaching their full potential. They could be a bright child but have fallen through the cracks because they are not engaging socially, or they do not feel smart so their worth declines. That has a spider web of impacts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7933791">We can help our children have access. A ton of children fell through the cracks in so many areas with the pandemic, which I am going to park because I have so many feelings on that. They really fell through the cracks and did not get access to testing. I think that if we have a national eye care strategy that helps in those very first few years, diagnosing whether there is a vision issue, we are going to prevent so many long-term issues. The same can be said for our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933792">Before I get to our seniors, I want to talk about the economic impacts when we look at prevention and what this is costing our system. There was a report from 2021. It is two years old, so the data could be even more current. A headline about the report reads, “New report reveals vision loss costs Canada almost $33 billion annually”. That is not chump change. That is not nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933793">If I go back to the beginning of what I said, our health is our mental health, so our mind and body have to be working well. If our eyes are not working well, this is going to impact our mental health as well, which costs the system. I do not even know that one can quantify whether that $33 billion would take into account all of the other secondary issues that would happen as a result of not having access to eye care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933794">The article about the report goes on to say, “What is most concerning is that 75 percent of vision loss is either preventable or treatable if caught early”, so we can see why the private member's bill has garnered support in the House. It is because it is just common sense, as we would say on this side of the House. The report revealed the following costs from vision loss borne by society and individuals every year—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933797">Madam Speaker, I believe that the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> was appointed to cabinet about two months ago, so my question is whether he has received his mandate letter yet from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Particularly, if he has received the mandate letter, could he provide the House with an update on the status of the amnesty for firearms and whether it is in place until October 30?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933798">I know there are a lot of folks across the country who are impacted by this. There is a lot interest from different advocacy groups about what is going to happen on October 30: whether there is going to be a buyback program in place by then and whether the amnesty is going to be extended. There are a lot of folks from different groups who just really want to get some understanding on whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office has given the new <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> a mandate letter, and whether that mandate letter has provided a little more clear direction on what the minister should be doing with regard to the October 30 deadline, which is quickly approaching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933799">I know this is something that, probably regardless of political stripe, a lot of folks are getting communications on in their offices, inquiries both from constituency groups and from different advocacy groups on all sides of the firearms debate. I was hoping the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> could provide an update on whether he has received his mandate letter. Broadly speaking, I think that is of interest to the House. Also, could he provide an update on the status of the October 30 amnesty as well as the status of the buyback program?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933801">However, it is important to note that when it comes to gun legislation in this country, Canadians have sent a very clear message that we expect to take off the streets those dangerous assault rifles that were meant to do maximum harm and were never meant to be in the hands of people in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933802"> With that being said, we have heard many perspectives, including those from indigenous communities and from hunters who are reasonable gun owners who use weapons for the purposes of hunting or sport shooting. Therefore, we want to make sure that in the process, when it comes to any gun legislation, we are listening and considering, making sure that our gun legislation is balanced.

We are still consulting to ensure that the rollout will provide the clarity that the member opposite is requesting.

The details of the buyback program will come forward and we will ensure that Canadian communities are safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933804">Madam Speaker, admittedly, it is a little concerning to hear that the government is still consulting and working on the buyback program and does not have clear direction for the House, given that we are about 30 days out from the amnesty expiring. Even when talking about firearms coming off the street or whatever, we can have a whole policy discussion about firearms ownership in Canada, but at the end of the day this is really about timing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933805"> We are now at 30 days away. We have not heard from the government with respect to whether the amnesty will be extended. I know that there are groups on all sides of the debate that are wondering if it is going to be extended. How does the government put in place a buyback program in a month? There needs to be a buyback program for retailers and for owners who obtained firearms legally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933806"> Again, maybe my colleague opposite would just like to take a moment to clarify: Is the October 30 amnesty going to be extended; and is the buyback program going to be implemented before October 30?</ParaText>

I do not share the pessimism that the member opposite has, when it comes to consultations to ensure that our policies are effective. The impact that we want to have in this country with this program is to create safer communities and get dangerous assault rifles off our streets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933808">Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in Adjournment Proceedings to have another go at a question I asked on May 30. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933809">I talked about the fact that, when fully implemented, the carbon tax is going to be 41¢ a litre, and the Liberals have a new carbon tax in the guise of fuel regulation that will add another 17¢. GST, of course, is going to be added to both of those, bringing us up to 61¢. I pointed out that Canadians cannot afford an extra 61¢ on a litre of gasoline. This does not just affect Canadians who drive a car. This makes fuel for public transit more expensive and the vehicles that municipalities run more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933810"> However, the response was quite striking. The <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> got up, and gave an entire answer talking about natural disasters, fires and floods, as if to say that Canadians have to pay this tax in order to stop hurricanes and forest fires. To bring that kind of political answer is just ridiculous. We have heard over and over again the claim that, if we oppose a tax on the basic necessities of life that all Canadians need, it is somehow our fault that devastating forest fires and deadly weather events happen, because we asked the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933811">How high does the carbon tax have to be? At what point will we solve a century of forestry mismanagement and the mismanagement of culling pine-beetled trees that allowed for these tinderbox conditions to arise? If the carbon tax is the solution, how high will the tax have to go? It staggers the imagination, and it is deeply offensive to Canadians who cannot afford to live. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933812">Rent has doubled. The down payment to buy a home has doubled. Mortgage payments have more than doubled. Groceries are out of control. The cost of heating a home is beyond what many Canadians can pay, and the new carbon taxes on fuel will add 61¢ a litre. Canadians cannot afford these expenses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933813">Therefore, for the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to get up and lecture me, lecture the opposition benches and, in so doing, lecture every Canadian who has to pay these taxes, really, telling them that it is their duty because this tax is responsible for stopping these catastrophic and complicated events. To trivialize such things as forest fires and wildfires by simply making it a matter of accepting a carbon tax is very disappointing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933814">I ask again: When will the government make life a little bit more affordable for Canadians and repeal these punitive taxes? </ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="300664" Type="18">Mr. Adam van Koeverden (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and to the Minister of Sport and Physical Activity, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7933815">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> this evening to talk about our plan to fight climate change and ensure affordability for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933816">Before I start, I spent the summer in my riding talking with my constituents and asking them how we can help more because things are expensive these days. When I was not meeting with my constituents and hearing from them, I was discussing the issues with economists, experts and researchers, and delving into the PBO report a bit. One thing I did not hear from any of my constituents this summer was that they would like us to do less to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933817">Fighting climate change requires more than just one approach. Certainly, pricing carbon is a necessity. It has won a Nobel Prize in economics. I do not have a Nobel Prize in economics, and I do not know if my colleague opposite has a Nobel Prize in economics, but the gentleman who does, whose name is William Nordhaus, won it for demonstrating clearly that, if we want to fight climate change from an economic perspective, then market-based instruments such as carbon pricing are an absolute necessity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933818">With respect to what my colleague opposite referred to as trivializing a natural disaster, there is a scientific straight line drawn between burning more fossil fuels, emitting more carbon pollution and increasing heat in northern boreal forests and the prevalence, intensity and duration of forest fires. It is not something that really can be debated. Climate change is having an impact on the severity of these forest fires, and we just had the worst year on record. It goes hand in hand that we want to fight climate change because we want families to be safe in their homes all year round. We do not want to have to evacuate far northern communities for weeks on end for fear that climate change will ruin their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933819">My colleague is right, that there are other ways to fight forest fires, such as through forest management strategies and having a better response to national disasters, but it does not change the fact that, if we want to fight climate change, then we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Canada's population is 0.5% of the global population, and we are responsible for 1.5% of global emissions. Simple math tells us that, as a result, individuals in Canada create three times as much pollution as the global average. That should tell any Canadian something, which is that we have work to do as Canadians. We should be stewards of the environment and the climate. Every young person who I meet within my riding, or in Alberta, as I spent some time in Alberta this summer, want us to focus on fighting climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933820">Unfortunately, all day today we did not hear any ideas from Conservatives other than they would axe the tax. That is their strategy. That is their new bumper sticker. That is the new T-shirt the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> goes around wearing. However, that is an irresponsible thing to say if they do not have an alternative, because the Conservatives have not put forth a plan to fight climate change or reduce our emissions. Instead, they use vague terms such as “technology”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933821">I have a question for my colleague. I hope he will indulge me. I have done my best by not reading my notes and listening intently to the member's speech. In an alternative universe, back in 2021, let us say that Erin O'Toole had won the election and the member opposite for <Affiliation DbId="278460" Type="2">Calgary Rocky Ridge</Affiliation> was the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change or perhaps the Minister of Transport. Would he follow through on his commitment that he ran on in 2021 to price carbon in Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7933823">If I am to take the point the member made in his response, which was that we are not fighting climate change and that the carbon tax is a successful policy instrument in fighting climate change, I might be prepared to accept his full argument, but the carbon tax has not allowed for Canada to meet any of its emissions targets. We are not controlling emissions or reducing emissions through the carbon tax. All it does is make life more expensive for Canadians who cannot afford to eat, heat or buy groceries.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7933824">Madam Speaker, that is actually not true. Canada's emissions have fallen, and Canada's emissions per GDP have fallen dramatically, in fact, and it is a result of action by this government. However, there is a lag period as well, because the previous government did almost nothing to fight climate change. It thought it was a big joke. The Harper government referred to the Kyoto protocol as a “socialist” regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933825">We still have a long way to go in this country, but it is going to take a concerted effort on behalf of each member of Parliament to listen to people in their riding who are actually experts, economists, experts on affordability and experts on fighting climate change, to develop a strategy that works for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7933826">Back to the issue of affordability for just a second. I happened to have a look at the PBO report, and I noted the bottom three quintiles of earners in Alberta net more money through the climate action incentive payment than they pay. Those are the most vulnerable Canadians. Those are the people who need it most. They are getting more money back because the two top quintiles, the fourth and the fifth quintiles, burn more fossil fuels.</ParaText>
