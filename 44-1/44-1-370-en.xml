            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278430" Type="2">Mr. Terry Dowdall (Simcoe—Grey, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8711791">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of all the great residents of Simcoe—Grey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711792">I just want to give a quick thanks. Last week was Remembrance Day, and I was invited to 15 ceremonies. I attended two of them on Remembrance Day, the only two I could go to during that time period since I was driving. I just want to thank the volunteers in my EDA for helping out to make sure that a wreath was placed at each event. I also had many volunteers out this weekend, as we had two parades, one in Angus and one in Collingwood. We have many parades. I thank them for their support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711793"> For those who were not here the last time I spoke, I was talking about seeing scandal after scandal, whether it is WE Charity, SNC-Lavalin or, probably  the largest one, the green slush fund, and about our frustration. I was talking about some of my residents, like Stephanie, who started a new poultry farm in my riding. She was due a GST rebate in April but had not received it by June, so she reached out to my office. In July she was told it was under audit and to follow up in three months. Already frustrated after the three months, she said that the GST refund could really help keep her new business going. However, it is government, so we waited until October 3, and guess what we were told. There was no audit noted on her file at all and no one was sure what was holding up the refund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711794">A week later, the CRA said there was no agent on her file at all. For nine months, this brand new business waited for a much-needed rebate cheque, but the CRA had no one on the file, could not say why the refund had not been processed and could not tell her when it might be. It is another incredibly frustrating experience for a Canadian just trying to get ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711795">As I have said here before, all of this is while the Liberals directed $338 million to projects in which board members of the green slush fund had a direct conflict of interest. For anyone who is paying attention right now, that is why so many people are frustrated with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and want him to go. Even some members of the Liberal Party are starting to understand that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711796">I am going to end my speech with the words of one of the courageous whistle-blowers who helped bring the Auditor General's attention to the corruption at the green slush fund:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The true failure of the situation stands at the feet of our current government, whose decision to protect wrongdoers and cover up their findings over the last 12 months is a serious indictment of how our democratic systems and institutions are being corrupted by political interference.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711798">I want to take this opportunity to thank that whistle-blower, who brought this to light. We do not need it, but it is why we are seeing frustration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711799">It is time to axe the tax. It is time for us to build the homes. It is time to fix the budget. It is time to stop the crime. Frustrated Canadians have had enough. They are worried about another budget and what the government will do to all Canadians and how it is going to affect their lives. It is time for us to call a carbon tax election and let them decide what the right thing to do is. It is time to bring it home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711800">Mr. Speaker, the multi-million dollar game continues as members of the Conservative Party want to send a very strong message to Canadians: They are more interested in the interests of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> than anyone else's. They are not listening to what Canadians are saying and continue to play a multi-million dollar game. I say shame on the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711801">If they wanted to contribute something positive and change the dial, one thing they could consider doing is recognizing that the leader of the official opposition still refuses to get a security clearance to deal with the issue of international foreign interference. My constituents still want to know why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> does not want to get a security clearance. What is he hiding? Is there something in his past that he does not want to tell Canadians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711802">Mr. Speaker, I find it quite comical to get that type of question. Last week, we had a week in our ridings, and I hope the member opposite spent a lot of time visiting his constituents. No one talked about anything other than the scandal and corruption of the government at every event I attended. From veterans to those at birthday celebrations to new Canadians, they all wanted to know when the election was going to happen. The emails I receive in my office are consistently about the frustration that Canadians are feeling. They understand that the government does not seem to care, so it is time to have a carbon tax election. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711803">Mr. Speaker, the member referenced Remembrance Day commemorations. This is very important. I want to underscore the incredible work that went into the Remembrance Day commemorations in New Westminster—Burnaby, including at New Westminster Secondary School, the remarkable ceremony at George Derby veterans hospital, at the New Westminster City Hall, at the South Burnaby Cenotaph, at Burnaby's Korean War Memorial and at the Royal Canadian Legion branch 83 in Burnaby and branch 2 in New Westminster. All of these commemorations were extremely important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711804">We know that our veterans gave their lives for democracy, and what they want to see is a functioning democracy. The NDP in this corner of the House was instrumental in getting to the bottom of the SNC-Lavalin scandal and the WE Charity scandal, as we are doing now with the SDTC scandal. We support the motion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711807">It is a simple process. It is unfathomable that the House made a decision and we have a government that is not going along with it. What I am hearing in my riding is that people are frustrated. Why are we here? Why do I have the ability to vote and to make a difference when the government will not accept the vote on this issue? Once again, le us get the documents so we can move on. </ParaText>

For example, hospitals could be built. I know of two that need funding. We could lower taxes so there is more money in seniors' pockets. All the money going to scandals could, quite frankly, go to debt or to finding ways to save money. Right now people are struggling, whether it is with food, rent or mortgages, so any money the government is wasting is money that is not going to good causes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711815">Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the good people of the riding of Waterloo, especially the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 530. We had a tremendous ceremony in Waterloo, and it was really impressive to see the number of people who showed up. We need to appreciate and never take for granted the democracy we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711816">A point that was raised was about the challenges Canadians are facing and the importance of housing. That is interesting. As we know, 18 members out of the entire Conservative Party care about and support their municipalities when it comes to ensuring that each individual has a safe and affordable place to call home. It is unfortunate that partisan politics is being played, and I commend those 18 Conservative members for stepping up and supporting their municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711817">Was the member one of those 18 MPs? Does he know anybody in the House who is opposed to this question of privilege? I support it and support the Speaker's ruling to ensure that it goes to PROC and we get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>

I can say that for a lot of programs, there are lots of announcements saying the Liberals are going to have all this funding and it is going to be fantastic, but it does not work. The rural areas do not get funding. Sometimes, not enough people can access funds from the programs; it is only great announcements. The Canada Infrastructure Bank, for example, was a flop that did not amount to anything. We just get empty promises at election time so the Liberals hope they can get some votes. Quite frankly, I think Canadians are frustrated and have had enough.</ParaText>

I have the same thing happening in my riding with a small business owed $90,000. For no reason, it has been withheld. The Liberals seem to have a lot of time to give their friends money and get into all these corrupt situations, but do not have enough time to help Canadians.

Are their staff more frustrated today when dealing with these bureaucracies than when they were elected? I am sure the answer would be yes, and I think that would be true right across the board if people were to give a true answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711823">For me, there has been frustration in getting information, getting through on the lines and getting money back, and all the while, the only thing that is better is the number of employees. Way more employees have been added, yet we have a lot fewer services. The frustration from individuals coming into my office is unbelievable. They will wait all day sometimes to get something with no phone calls back. It has never been like this before, so it is frustrating.</ParaText>

It seems that every day there are new revelations surrounding this scandal-plagued minister. With each of these new revelations, it is crystal clear, to seemingly everyone but the minister and the Prime Minister, that the minister is about the last person in the House who should be sitting around the cabinet table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711832">Let us look at the facts. The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> was a partner with one Stephen Anderson in a shady PPE company called Global Health Imports. This is a company that has been sued by multiple clients and has been ordered by Alberta courts to pay back $7.8 million for ripping off clients. Not only that, the minister almost certainly violated the Conflict of Interest Act. More specifically, the Conflict of Interest Act states clearly that a minister of the Crown shall not be involved in the operations of business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711833">Text messages reveal that someone named Randy from Global Health Imports was intricately involved in business during the very same time that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> sat in cabinet. More specifically, those text messages reveal that this Randy from Global Health Imports was involved in a half-a-million dollar shakedown of a California based client that had ordered PPE equipment. At the behest of this Randy, the client, the Ghaoui Group, transferred half-a-million dollars to Global Health Imports, the PPE was never delivered and the Ghaoui Group has commenced legal action, claiming wire fraud, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711834">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> says he is not that Randy, except for the fact that, at all material times, the Ghaoui Group believed that the Randy in the text messages was the Minister of Employment. The minister's business partner, Stephen Anderson, has admitted there is no one from Global Health Imports named Randy other than the minister. The text messages reference Randy as a partner. We know the minister had been a partner. The text messages place this Randy in Vancouver. It turns out that the Minister of Employment was in Vancouver at the same time, and no one can find this other Randy. There is no plausible explanation as to who this other Randy could be. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the Randy in the text messages is the Minister of Employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711835">Therefore, the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> broke the law and violated the Conflict of Interest Act. On that basis alone, he should be removed from cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711836">However, there is more. Recently, we learned that Global Health Imports, while the minister was an active partner in the company, made two bids for federal contracts in which the company held itself out as a wholly owned indigenous company. The problem with that is that it is not a wholly owned indigenous company, because neither Anderson nor the minister are indigenous. What the minister and his business partner Anderson did is clear. They tried to take advantage of the government's indigenous procurement program to obtain government contracts. In short, they tried to steal contracts that should be awarded to legitimate indigenous businesses. This is cultural appropriation that is completely disgusting, and it is something else. It is called fraud, and it raises questions of potential criminality involving the minister. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8711837">The minister says that he had no idea, that it was all Anderson who did this behind his back. I wish to re-emphasize that the minister was a 50% shareholder and was one of two business partners. For the minister to claim that he had no idea that they were trying to rig the system to steal government contracts is not believable. It is even less believable in the face of what has come to light, which is that the minister has a long-standing track record of misrepresenting his indigenous status. In that regard, I would note that this is a minister, according to news reports, who, as far back as the 2012 Liberal convention when he was seeking a party nomination, represented himself to be Métis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711838">In 2015, after he was elected, in a social media post, the Liberal Party listed the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> as one of 10 indigenous Liberal MPs elected. The minister said that he was Métis back in 2012, but then, when he was elected to this place, between 2016 and 2018 he repeatedly characterized himself as a non-status adopted Cree, referencing his adopted great-grandmother, who he claimed had Cree roots. He even touted that he had a Cree name called “strong eagle man”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711839">When confronted about his status and the fact that he was falsely representing this, the minister has seen fit to now change his story to say that he is not a non-status adopted Cree. In fact, he is now alleging that his mother is Métis and his brother is Métis. The bottom line is that this is a <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who continually changes his story. He misrepresents who he is. He misrepresents who he is not. The minister is a cultural appropriator. He has tried to appropriate and represent himself as being indigenous for political gain as well as financial gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711840">Today, it is reported in the National Post, if that is not enough, that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s company, Global Health Imports, while the minister was a partner, was sharing a PO box with none other than an individual involved in cocaine trafficking, someone who was busted by the Edmonton police in 2013 and busted again in the Dominican Republic, caught with 200 kilograms of cocaine. This is who the minister is associated with, who the minister is doing business with or who he is at least connected to in terms of sharing a post office box. It really begs this question. Whose company are ministers in the government keeping?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711841"> Between the $7.8 million in judgments against his company, the fact that he violated the Conflict of Interest Act, the fact that he has misrepresented himself as indigenous for political and financial gain and his ties, now, to someone connected to cocaine, it begs the question, again. What is it going to take for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to fire the minister from Edmonton, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711842">We have before us a question of privilege to bring in Anderson, who defied a parliamentary committee when he refused to disclose who Randy was, and we know why. Because it is the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>. When he comes before the House at the bar, we need to ensure that the process is an orderly one.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711880"> Mr. Speaker, it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the Conservative Party wants to keep playing this multi-million dollar game, and that is what it is. It is all about the self-interest of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party of Canada, which wants to prevent the House of Commons from being able to debate issues that Canadians are genuinely concerned about and a number of pieces of legislation that are before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711881">I would repeat the question I had asked the member opposite, and I think members opposite should listen very carefully. This is the tactic of the Conservatives, even when they were in government, when Stephen Harper was the prime minister and their current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> was a member of the cabinet and the parliamentary secretary to the prime minister. The way they attempt to win an election is to label things as corrupt and to attack personalities, and no personality has been harder hit by the Conservative Party than the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s. They do it not only inside the chamber but also outside the chamber, and they have no reservations whatsoever in terms of misleading Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711882">We can look at the question I asked the member opposite. Not once, not twice, but three times the independent office of the Ethics Commissioner has cleared the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> in question, yet the Conservative Party does not recognize that. It does not recognize the independence of the office, because what trumps the commissioner is the political, self-serving agenda of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party in general. That is why we have seen individual former prime ministers reflect very negatively on the Conservative Party. The late Brian Mulroney, Kim Campbell and others have been critical of the Conservative Party of Canada today because it has lost its moral compass in dealing with issues of a progressive nature as it focuses solely on misleading through social media, and virtually attempting to paralyze the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711883">There are no opposition days, no government business, legislation or private members' bills being discussed, because the Conservative Party is completely preoccupied with this multi-million dollar game. This is a continuation, just like another privilege issue we are debating. The Conservatives brought forward another privilege issue, which we have before us today. They said to stop the debate on the amendment to the amendment to a motion that they introduced, which all of us wanted to support, but it did not fit their agenda because they did not want it to come to an actual vote. They did not want the debate to go to the standing committee. Instead, they want to use the motion as a way to blackmail members of Parliament and to filibuster what should be taking place on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711884"> It is disrespectful to Canadians. It is absolutely a waste of tax dollars, and I would suggest that, ironically, it is borderline in contempt of Parliament, the manner in which the Conservatives continue to play this multi-million dollar game. The best way to describe it, in terms of the abuse, is to look at the motion we are debating today. The essence of it is that a member of the community is called to the bar and has to answer questions. Is there anyone opposing that?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8711885">However, like the other motion of privilege, which is still going to be debated this afternoon, it stops the government from bringing anything else forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711886">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Yay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711887">
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Mr. Speaker, one member across the way said “yay”, but there are other issues, and not just government issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711888"> The Conservatives have opposition day motions, and when they bring them forward, they like to say the motions are confidence motions. However, I think Canadians would love to see an opposition day motion that deals with the housing accelerator fund. We have 17 Conservative members across the way who are scared because the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is saying the party opposes it. The party is going to kill that particular fund. Therefore, we have Conservative MPs who are having a difficult time trying to justify their very existence on such an important issue. We should have a vote on that particular issue, but we cannot do so. The Conservatives know full well that all they have to do is continue to put up speaker after speaker on matters of privilege, and then nothing else can take place on the floor for debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711889">The housing accelerator fund is providing thousands of housing units, or homes, in every region of our country, but we have the official opposition opposing it. Actually, that is not fair to say. We have the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> saying that the program is bad and needs to be cut. However, a dozen or more Conservative members are saying they like the program. They are writing to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> to say that they want this program to be applied in our communities. We have mayors in different areas of the country saying that this is a good program. However, there is this division within the Conservative Party. In order to avoid that sort of a division, why not continue to talk about privilege? It is a privilege motion for which everyone is saying yes to having the member come before the bar, but the Conservatives have no interest in voting on it. As I have indicated very clearly, it is a fairly straightforward motion that Mr. Anderson be called before the bar to answer questions. If everyone believes that, fine, we will accept that and allow it to come to a vote. However, what is the purpose of the Conservative Party not only continuing to debate the motion but now also actually moving an amendment to the motion, which means that we could see dozens speak to it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711890"> What happened on the previous motion? We saw over 100 Conservatives speak to it. Weeks and weeks of potential debate on other issues were left to the wayside and never dealt with, such as Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>, an act to amend the Citizenship Act; Bill <Document DbId="12960457" Type="3">C-66</Document>, which would transfer issues related to sexual abuse from military courts to civil courts; Bill <Document DbId="12062671" Type="3">C-33</Document>, strengthening the port system and railway safety in Canada act, which deals with our supply lines; and Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the proposed online harms act to protect children on the Internet. This is not to mention the fall economic statement or the many opposition days that are being lost because the Conservatives are filling the time on issues of privilege, even though the very motions they are bringing forward are ones that we are okay with actually seeing pass. The reason, as I started off by saying, is that it is a multi-million dollar game, and it is all about character assassination. This is why I posed the question to the member opposite: What is the issue? </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8711891"> The issue is that we have a <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> representing an Edmonton riding, and there have been concerns in regard to some text messaging and how that could have had an impact on the issue at hand. As I have pointed out, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has looked at this issue not once, not twice, but three times and cleared the minister responsible each time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711892">When I posed that particular question to the member, his response was that it is not true. It is true. Members of the Conservative Party know it is true, but they continue to push. Why is that? It is because, as I pointed out in my question, even when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was the leader of the Liberal Party in third party, the Conservative Party continued to attack the individual. Nothing has changed. The wonderful thing about Hansard is that everything said inside the chamber is actually recorded and there for people to read. People do not have to believe me; they can just read the Hansards. We can go back to the time when the leader of the Liberal Party was in third party. We will find personal attacks on the leader, especially in member statements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711893">We have witnessed it of other ministers inside the chamber. It is the type of thing where I could enter into that same field, talk about personalities and start to look at the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. I referred to an interesting document. By the way, the relevance of this is in regard to the issue of attacking the character of an individual. It is some sort of a report that was published. The title is “Stephen Harper, Serial Abuser of Power: The Evidence Compiled”. Actually, not all the evidence is compiled, because there are a number of things I am aware of that are not actually included in this document. However, it is about abuse of power, scandals and corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711894">There are 70 of them listed, for anyone who is interested, but one of them that is really interesting is that Stephen Harper was actually found in contempt of Parliament. We can think about that. He is the only prime minister in the British Commonwealth, which includes Canada, to ever be found in contempt of Parliament. Can we guess who his parliamentary secretary was? It was the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711895">That is one, but I am a little off topic there. I go through this article, and the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>'s name comes up on more than one occasion. Let us go to page 9, to something called the vanity video; the article reads, “The Globe and Mail revealed that Harper’s chosen Minister for Democratic Reform [the now leader of the Conservative Party] commissioned a team of public servants for overtime work on a Sunday to film him glad-handing constituents.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711896">It goes on, but he was promoting using civil servants and wearing his Conservative Party uniform, and of course, we cannot do that. If the Ethics Commissioner was to look into that, I suspect maybe they would have found some sort of fine or a penalty, or he would have been found offside. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8711897">However, one of the ones Harper is really well known for is the “Elections bill [that] strips power from Elections Canada”. The story says, “The Fair Elections Act also makes it harder for Canadians to vote as more ID is required. Nationwide protests in which more than 400 academics took part forced [the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>] to withdraw some measures in the bill because of their alleged anti-democratic bent.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711898">Anti-democratic: I think there could be some relevancy here. It goes on to say, the “Democratic Reform Minister [the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>] accused the Elections Canada CEO Marc Mayrand of being a power monger and wearing a team jersey.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711899">Here we have the Conservative Party now calling into question the Ethics Commissioner, but when the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was the minister responsible for democratic reform, he labelled the chief of our electoral system, Elections Canada. That is why I do not say it lightly. We have a leader of the Conservative Party who is in borderline contempt, in terms of what we are witnessing in Parliament today. He has no qualms doing that. It is demonstrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711900">Not only that, but if we take a look at the issue of security clearance, I do not know how many times I have asked the question of Conservative MP after Conservative MP: Why does the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation> not get the security clearance so that he can better understand foreign interference? That is a very real issue. We have all sorts of things that are taking place in our community. An individual has been murdered; individuals are being held in many different ways for financial purposes. We have all sorts of interference in political parties, in the leader of the Conservative Party's own leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711901">When he was elected as leader, there were issues related to foreign interference and how that influenced the leadership that he ultimately won. The Bloc, the Green, the NDP and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> all have the security clearance. He is the only leader who does not. Why will the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> not do likewise? The arguments he uses are bogus. He knows that. We have experts clearly indicating that the leader of the Conservative Party has nothing to worry about in terms of being able to get the security clearance, from a perspective of being able to listen and talk about the issue of the day. That is not the concern. However, it does raise an issue. What is in the background of the leader of the Conservative Party regarding which, ultimately, he is scared to get that security clearance? I believe there is something there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711902">There is something that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> does not want Canadians to know. I think we should find that out. That is why, whether it is me or other members of the government, we will continue to call upon the leader of the Conservative Party to get that security clearance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711903">Instead of playing this multi-million dollar game, let us start dealing with the issues that are important to Canadians. Let us talk about the fall economic statement and the legislation before the House that the Conservatives do not want to have discussions on. Let us have opposition days and private members' bills. We should allow the chamber to do the work that Canadians want us to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711904">As the Conservative Party, and the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> in particular, is so focused on them, I can assure people following the debate that the Government of Canada and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will always continue to be focused on Canadians first and foremost. Unfortunately, we have to participate in this game; however, at the end of the day, we will continue to push a Canadian agenda, an agenda that reflects what we believe Canadians want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711905">That is something we will continue to advocate for. I would ask that, if Conservatives across the way understand the cost of the game they are playing, they stop with the character assassination they began back in 2011. Let us get down to business and do some good things for Canadians. We can do so much more if we start working together. Not only were all the other parties given a responsibility to do some good things inside the chamber, but the Conservative Party was too. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711936">Mr. Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> from Alberta has said a lot of things, but we know he is a fake and a fraud. He said that he was not the Randy involved in the company in question in hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraud cases that are now before the courts. He said he was not involved with the company while he was in cabinet, but of course now there is evidence that is not true. He also said that he was indigenous, in order to profit from contracts, effectively stealing from members of first nations communities. He should resign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711937">Here we are today, again dealing with more revelations about the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton. There are lots of proud Albertans who serve on this side of the House. I know it is a real challenge for them to have to hear over and over again about the member whom the Liberal Prime Minister has elevated to cabinet to represent that province, because the minister does not represent the people and the values of the great Canadian province of Alberta, nor does he represent the values of the hard-working Canadians from across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711938">We have heard today in debate from representatives of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that there is some kind of Conservative fiction, but they are telling on themselves. After nine years, the facts have become really inconvenient for the NDP-Liberal coalition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711939">The National Post says, “‘It's just shocking’: Liberal cabinet minister's shifting Indigenous identity scorned”. Global News says, “Ethics Committee reopens...inquiry in wake of new ‘Randy’ texts”. Here is another from the National Post: “Multiple texts about ‘other Randy’ blamed on ‘auto-correct’ by [the minister's] former business partner”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711940">Le Devoir says that the minister from Edmonton's past is being questioned. I want to zero in on this for a quick second because there has been a lot of talk about the other Randy. How many other Randys are there? Let us start with fake journalist Randy because the article in Le Devoir, from June 27, lays out the the disproved claim by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> at the heart of the scandal that Randy was a journalist, so journalist Randy is reported in Le Devoir.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711941">There is also across the Canadian media spectrum, including in CBC, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s fake claims about being indigenous, so there is that other Randy. In committee, Liberal members have said that the other Randy might not even be Randy; it might be Randeep, so there is the cover-up Randy. Today in the news, there is cocaine Randy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711942">There is a cocaine connection with a Liberal cabinet <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation>. It is not like he owned a 1% share in a company; 50% of the business was owned by the Liberal minister. What was the business? It was a pandemic profiteering enterprise, to be clear, that is now at the centre of more than a half-dozen fraud allegations that are before the courts and that is the subject of an unresolved investigation by the Edmonton police about a suspicious fire in the warehouse of the Liberal minister from Edmonton.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8711943">That is what we are talking about, and his 50% business partner came before committee and lied. That is why we find ourselves before the House with a prima facie case of privilege and why he needs to come before the House. Questions need to be put to him about that because he lied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711944">We know there are rules in this place about parliamentary language, so let us quickly rewind. The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Liberal minister</Affiliation> has said that he was a journalist. It is printed in the media. It was looked into, and it is not true. He has said that he is indigenous. We have seen it in media reports, and again, what he said was not true. He has said that he was not involved in the ongoing operation of his business, but then, in the media and in court filings, we see more about the fraud that his business has perpetrated. We see that his claim is not true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711945">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Liberal minister</Affiliation> claimed that it could not have been him who was communicating with Mr. Anderson, his 50% business partner, because he was at a cabinet retreat in Vancouver. There were text messages in which his business partner said that he was talking to Randy in Vancouver, but he claimed that “Randy” was an autocorrect, and that the dozens of messages including it were all autocorrects, but that is exactly where he was. When we brought him back before the committee, like in so many other examples in this Liberal scandal, he changed his story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711946">The Liberals talk about the Ethics Commissioner having cleared him. Only these guys would come in here to say that he has been investigated a bunch of times, but they have not been able to nail him yet, when that is because he keeps hiding the evidence. The first time, he said, “Oh, I turned over the phone records,” but it was not all of the phone records.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711947"> This <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Liberal minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton was just asked over the last couple of days at a press conference whether the Edmonton police should investigate what has been revealed, and he did not say yes. Why would this Liberal not want the police to investigate if he has nothing to hide? He said that the Ethics Commissioner said that he is clear, but the Ethics Commissioner is not able to go to court to get a warrant and seize the bank records and the phone records that would demonstrate that this minister was doing the exact opposite of what he said he was doing. He was directly involved in the operation of his business, which, by the way, was bidding on and winning federal government contracts while he was sitting at the cabinet table. That is a fact, but he said that it did not happen. We cannot believe anything he says.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711948">If it is not astonishing for Canadians that this <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Liberal minister</Affiliation> and his business partner are sharing resources and their business is co-located with cocaine traffickers with hundreds of kilos of cocaine being involved in their trafficking enterprise, it might be astonishing that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and that Liberal parliamentary secretary will stand up and go to the barricades for him because they do not think he did anything wrong. That is how rotten the Liberal government has become. The corruption we have seen includes hundreds of millions of dollars from the green slush fund going to Liberal insiders, with 186 conflicts of interest, and $60 million for arrive scam, which was two jokers in a basement getting paid $20 million to do no IT work on that IT program. While one in four Canadians in this city and across the country are lining up at food banks, which are record numbers, they are lining the pockets of Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711949"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in 2015 that there would be sunny ways. It sure is sunny for Liberal insiders and their well-connected friends, but for everybody else, it is stormy skies and a rocky ride. They do not know how they are going to feed themselves. They do not know how they are going to heat their homes this winter. Small business insolvencies are up 40% this year, to say nothing of the businesses that are just not opening because business owners cannot survive in this anti-competitive, inflationary environment with the Prime Minister raising his carbon tax on absolutely everything.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8711950"> The Liberals are punishing Canadians for just living their lives, and it is all to finance their reckless spending, but all the money they take from Canadians is not enough. They have still devalued our currency with their money printing to pay for their schemes and pad the pockets of their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711951">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was twice found guilty of breaking Canada's ethics laws. His <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> broke the law. The Liberal Speaker, the former parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, broke the law. The <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation> broke the law. Those are all Liberals, and they all broke the law. It is a cabinet and caucus made up of serial lawbreakers, so it is no wonder that we learned today about the cocaine connection of that Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton, a right hand of the Prime Minister, who is at the centre of more than a half-dozen fraud cases before the courts, and his business partner came before committee and lied. That minister said he had no communication with his business partner while he was serving in cabinet, but he was doing it from a cabinet retreat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711952"> If we want the answers, and if we want the truth from these guys, we cannot believe that we are going to get it on the first crack. That is why this is so far beyond the Ethics Commissioner. There was a pointed question from a journalist who said that this Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was too much of a chicken to agree that the police should investigate and the police should take a look. These are who these Liberals, and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, after nine years, have in charge: fraudsters and scammers, fakes and phonies. They are disenfranchising the very people they claimed they would be the best at protecting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711953">That Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton spent his weekend on an apology tour, now that he has been caught for claiming to be indigenous to win contracts for indigenous-run businesses, but he is only sorry that he got caught. That in and of itself should have every one of them over there standing up and calling for his resignation, but where are they on that? They are too blinded by their hope that, in the dying days, as crew members of the Titanic, they might be called up to the bridge to serve in the cabinet. They are thinking that could be them, so they better not say anything. They better not stand up for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711954"> That is their legacy. That is that death rattle that we hear from the Liberal government. It is the sound of complicity from self-interested Liberals who are literally trying to change the law so that the election can be a week later, knowing that they are going to lose their seats, so they can get their pensions. Their preoccupation is looking after themselves and not looking after Canadians. It is a government of apologies and photo ops. That is what it has done for nine years, and Canadians are paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711955"> What have the Liberals not broken? They broke housing in our country. They broke our immigration system. It is unbelievable. They also broke our food banks. Food bank use has doubled. Food banks are running out of food. They have had to extend their hours. When 25% of Canadians are depending on food banks, and the unemployment rate is under 6.5%, that is an awful lot of people who are working and who have to rely on the food bank to feed themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711956">However, it is worse than that. I am hearing from food banks about folks who have to get to the food bank between shifts at their two jobs, which are not enough to pay the bills. People have to go from their first job to the food bank, get enough food to feed themselves and their families, and then go back to work at their next job. That is the legacy of the government after nine years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8711957">Who is the government looking out for? It is not Canadians. It is not looking out for the Canadians who are struggling to afford a meal, heat their homes or buy their first home. The government is abandoning Canadians in their time of need. When we put forward common-sense solutions, such as taking the GST off of new home constructions under a million dollars, the government will not do it. Why is that? First of all, it would increase housing supply by about 30,000 homes a year and would save Canadians tens of thousands of dollars on the purchase of those homes. That is not what it is interested in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711958">It is a government of photo ops and apology, but man, does it have a lot to be sorry for. The government should not be telling Canadians that they should be sorry, which is what it likes to do. It should stand up to apologize because what we have seen is shameful. There is a minister of the Crown serving in the Liberal government whose business is connected to cocaine traffickers, and that connection has been while he was in cabinet. We are not talking about something from 20 years ago. He is currently involved. The only reason he is not an owner of the business anymore is that he collapsed his shares on the eve of his appearance at committee to testify about his involvement with these fraudsters and hucksters. It is obscene what goes on with the Liberals and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> after nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711959">However, I have great news for Canadians. There is scandal, mismanagement and corruption, which we are seeing over there today, that Canadians have become used to and that has been normalized. It has them feeling as though there is no hope. Life was not like this before the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the NDP-Liberal government, and it will not be like it after them. There is no political opportunity that the Liberals would not take to help advantage themselves. It does not seem to faze them if it disenfranchises or disadvantages Canadians in the process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711960">We really have to wonder why, without having to drill down into any of the waste in the government programs they have put out, which just build more bureaucracy but do nothing to help Canadians, such as their supposed solutions for housing that have driven down housing starts and driven up bureaucracy, or the tens of millions of dollars on their failed confiscation with compensation scheme, their so-called gun buyback, to give people money for things the government never owned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711961">Meanwhile, we have police unions across the country, including the Toronto Police Association today, calling out the government and red circling the Liberals for the chaos and disorder on the streets. The Liberals will say that they are all Conservatives and Conservative lobby groups. The largest police association, the largest police union in the country, is calling them out, but they are so blinded by their own self-interest that they just cannot get out of their own way. How can they stand up today to defend the indefensible? The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Liberal minister from Edmonton</Affiliation>, who refuses to resign, will not stand up today to offer his resignation or an apology on the floor of the House of Commons, although Canadians deserve a lot more than that. He should have been fired. It seems like the Liberals do not have the moral clarity or the intestinal fortitude to do the right thing and make sure that the Liberal minister from Edmonton does not continue to serve in cabinet and represent their party and their <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711962">The Liberals are going to have a rude awakening when Canadians get that carbon tax election because common-sense Conservatives will demonstrate our plan to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime, especially the crimes of the criminals on the front bench and backbenches across the way.</ParaText>

It is really shameful and I understand why they are so upset.

              <ParaText id="8711990">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague from Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes for his outstanding work on the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. I thank him for helping Canadians learn more about this and, above all, for shining a light, day after day, on all those revelations in the newspapers about Canada's <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Official Languages</Affiliation>. It takes dedication, and it is also a lot of work. Indeed, I doubt a day goes by without my colleague learning something new about the various ways in which the minister responsible for official languages has used his duties, his position, his name or his other name—I will talk about that later—for his personal gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711991">I also want to thank all the members who sit on the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, especially my Conservative colleagues who have relentlessly asked questions. Thanks to those questions, we have learned a great deal about this whole affair that is currently before the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711992">This is a very important issue. We are talking about a minister in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s cabinet who, well, is a fraud in many respects. He has demonstrated that, and now we have tangible proof. I will come back to that a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711993">Canadians are struggling right now. We live in a country where the cost of food is skyrocketing, where young people cannot even imagine ever owning a home because housing prices are so high, and where food banks are in crisis. Newspapers are reporting that food banks are in crisis. We live in a country where violent crime is on the rise, in big cities and in rural regions alike. Crime is up 256% since 2015. What matters most to this Prime Minister and this cabinet? Their top priority is to protect the Minister of Official Languages and make sure he keeps his job, despite all the evidence that has been presented against him, showing that he gleefully put his hands in the cookie jar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711994">When he was caught with his hands in the cookie jar, he rushed to eat them all up, to get rid of the evidence and to keep his hands free so he could go right back in for more. That is what is happening right now with this situation involving the Minister of Official Languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711995">I have a little file on everything that has happened so far with the Minister of Official Languages, such as the story about the other Randy. Several people may have testified about that. It is rather startling to look at all the press coverage since June. I am only going to read the headlines, but I think it is important for Canadians to understand how the situation with the Minister of Official Languages has evolved. I will start with the francophone media, where there have been fewer articles. Those listening will see the correlation with the rest of my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711996"> The first article reporting on this situation appeared on June 27. The headline read, “Minister's past questioned”. On July 5, Radio-Canada published an article entitled “[Official languages minister] cleared by an ethics inquiry, but not by the opposition”. There were no articles between July 5 and October 2. On October 2, Le Droit published an article under the headline, “[Official languages minister]'s business dealings again the subject of debate”. On November 15, the following article appeared in Radio-Canada: “[Minister of Official Languages] apologizes for lack of clarity about his indigenous identity”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8711997">On the surface, for the francophones listening to us and for the people watching us who follow federal politics, this might seem like a trifle. People might wonder why the House of Commons is spending so much time talking about the Minister of Official Languages.</ParaText>

Every time the Liberal government is attacked, a member of the NDP tries to cause a distraction to defend and protect it. It is almost a reflex. If we are where we are today—and all we have to do is think about the state of our public finances, about what is happening to Canadians standing in line at the food bank, about the ever-rising crime rate, about the people who are living in tents because they do not have a home—it is because the NDP supports, has supported and will continue to support this ineffective Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712059">This ineffective Liberal government has a fake in its cabinet, a fake who admits it. However, he does not have the decency or the courage to hand in his resignation. He does not have the courage or the decency to respect ministerial responsibility and resign.

There is another fib on the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Official Languages</Affiliation>' resume that is very serious for an official languages minister. The Minister of Official Languages campaigned as a successful entrepreneur. We understand why he was successful, given his ties with the government. However, he also ran as a journalist. The Minister of Official Languages claimed to be a journalist. That is true. It is not a joke. Le Devoir questioned that and took an interest in this particular situation on June 27.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712091">I would like to say that unlike the Conservatives, who are acting incredibly childishly and disingenuously in the House of Commons, we believe in transparency and getting to the bottom of things. That is why we have raised broad concerns about both the questions of privilege: the SDTC, which my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> has raised repeatedly, and now this issue of calling before the bar Mr. Anderson, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="278613" Type="2">Hamilton Centre</Affiliation> has raised in committee and in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712092">We have raised concerns because we want Canadians to get to the bottom of this Liberal scandal. I will submit as well that when it came to the SNC-Lavalin scandal, it was the NDP MPs who played the pivotal role in getting to the bottom and getting answers for Canadians. When it came to WE Charity, it was the member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> and I who got to the bottom of that issue, and when it comes to SDTC and the questions swirling around GHI, these are issues the NDP believes Canadians have the right to transparency on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712093">That is absolutely a fundamental principle in this democracy. It was abused horribly during the Harper regime. Conservative corruption, scandals and cover-ups were unbelievable. I will come back to that in just a moment. Every single Conservative MP should hang their head in shame when they speak to issues of transparency and accountability, when we had the worst government in Canadian history, without a doubt, over a number of years with a majority government, shutting down every single parliamentary inquiry and every single attempt at transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712094">We did not have people called to the bar during the Harper regime, because Conservatives refused it and shut it down. They refused any information going to Canadians. Conservative MPs stand up and postulate and do the play-acting they do so well, when they had the worst, most corrupt regime that engaged in the broadest cover-ups in Canadian history and have never apologized for it. They have never come forward and said they were sorry. They obviously have not learned the lessons. In fact, we know the four slogans the Conservatives would love to bring forward in the next election, and they are all to “bring back”: bring back Conservative cover-ups; bring back Conservative cuts, as we saw during the Conservative regime; bring back Conservative corporate tax havens; and bring back Conservative corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712095">The reality is that Canadians deserve better. They deserve better than the Liberal scandals we are seeing now, and they deserve better than the unbelievably horrible years of the Harper regime and the cover-ups, scandals and misspending of billions of dollars that no Conservative MP has ever apologized for. No Conservative MP has ever stood up and said, “We really screwed up. We should not have covered up. We should not have had all of this corruption.” They have never done it, so Canadians cannot trust Conservatives to clean up Ottawa, and they obviously cannot trust Liberals either. That is why the NDP has stood up and said repeatedly that we need transparency. Regardless what the source of the scandal is, it is important to get to the bottom of things.</ParaText>

I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="278613" Type="2">Hamilton Centre</Affiliation>, who is our ethics critic, was forthright in pushing for answers that Canadians deserved to get to ensure that Canadians would understand what transpired. Because Mr. Anderson was not forthcoming at committee hearings when repeatedly asked questions to which Canadians demand answers, it is important that he be called before the bar and forced to answer those questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712105">I have two points to make before I come back to the issues of how Parliament and the government should be run. From the NDP's standpoint, and from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>'s standpoint, it is time that we close off the decades of Conservative corruption and Liberal scandals and that we move to a Parliament and a government of which Canadians can be proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712106">My first point is that these are serious allegations of connections, as Conservatives have pointed out in their statements as well, concerning the issue of illegal activity linked potentially to a post office box that was registered in the name of a company, which was at least 50% owned by a member of cabinet, and they need to be fully explored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712107">I want to remind the Canadian public of how bad things were under the Harper regime. We do not want a repetition of that. I will read into the record an article dated May 8, 2008, from the Toronto Star, which talks about concerns about a top cabinet minister in the Conservative government and a former girlfriend with past ties to the Hells Angels. The article states that Prime Minister Stephen Harper “dismiss[ed] security concerns over the relationship between a top cabinet minister and a former girlfriend with past ties to the Hells Angels.” Stephen Harper also brushed off the matter and instead accused the opposition of being “gossipy old busybodies”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712108">That was the reaction of Stephen Harper to a similar situation. This is why I say that New Democrats, as the adults in the House, are not going to take any lessons from the childish Conservatives. Their reaction to a similar set of circumstances being tied to a minister in the Conservative cabinet was to say that there was nothing to see. That is the Conservative record. That is the record of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. That is the record of every single Conservative MP, except for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278236" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> who resigned because he could not stand the hypocrisy of the difference between what Conservatives say and what they actually do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712109">This is something that Conservatives wear, and they will wear it forever until they stand and apologize to all Canadians for their misbehaviour, for their corruption, for their cover-ups and for their cuts that hurt so many people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712110"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> spoke earlier about the cuts to veteran services across the country. How mean do people have to be to finance these massive overseas tax havens with $30 billion a year given to the corporate elite and the billionaires, but to finance it, they will cut health care, cut supports for seniors and cut veteran services? How irresponsible do they have to be?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712111">It is an unbelievably mixed-up sense of priorities to say billionaires first and veterans get thrown out on the street. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> spoke very eloquently to that earlier. That is the Conservative record. It is cutting veteran services, forcing them out on the street and forcing them to be homeless. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712112">Not a single Conservative MP has ever stood up and apologized for the years of corruption and cuts, and all the hurt caused to so many Canadians. I think Canadians would be forgiving if one Conservative were willing to stand up and say that the Conservatives are sorry for all the damage they did to our country; that they are sorry for the $300 billion that we gave to the rich, the well-connected and Conservative insiders, that they apologize for that; that they are sorry for slashing our health care system, the implications of which we still see today; that they are sorry for throwing veterans out on the street; and that they are sorry for cutting CBSA and RCMP officers, cutting the crime prevention centres, seeing crime go up. Crime is always higher under the Conservatives. We have seen this time and again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712113"> In the United States, the Republican states have the highest crime rates. In Canada, Conservative provinces have the highest crime rates. Why? Because Conservatives cut all the infrastructure and the institutions that actually enhance public safety, including the cruel cutting of crime prevention centres. We know that a dollar invested in crime prevention saves $6 in court costs, policing costs and prison costs. To cut the crime prevention centres is unbelievable hypocrisy. The Conservatives pretend that they have some credibility on public safety. They certainly do not; they were terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712114"> The Liberals can be criticized, as we do in the NDP corner of the House, for not fixing what the Conservatives broke. They have not re-established the crime prevention centres. They have not sourced up CBSA and the RCMP to the extent that is needed. They have not corrected all the Conservatives' gaffes and irresponsible actions, and that is on them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712119">Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives laugh at their health care cuts that caused so many problems. They laugh at cutting all the public safety infrastructure. They laugh at the $30 billion, according to the PBO, that they gave Mr. Harper and the entire Harper regime. Every single Conservative MP voted for the $30 billion that went to offshore tax havens. Canadians are not laughing. Under the Conservative government, we saw a doubling of food bank lineups and housing costs. The Conservatives will say that the Liberals did the same thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712120"> That is why we have to stop this cycle of two inept parties, neither of which are able and capable of governing the way Canadians deserve to see. They want to see a government that does things like putting in place dental care and pharmacare, which was as a result of the NDP, anti-scab legislation and affordable housing. Finally, after decades of having affordable housing simply ignored under the Conservatives and the Liberals, the NDP forced investments in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712121"> These are all the things the NDP did with 25 members. Imagine what we would be able to do with 225 members. We would ensure that Canadians are taken care of and that seniors actually would receive the supports they need. We would not be throwing veterans out on the streets. The Conservatives laugh when we say they threw veterans out on the streets. Veterans with disabilities are being thrown out on the street and they laugh at that. They find that funny, yet they go to Remembrance Day ceremonies and pretend. They put their hand over their heart and they say that they stand for veterans. No, they do not. We saw what they did to veterans and we will not let them do it to them ever again. What they did was reprehensible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712122"> The Conservative MPs should hang their head in shame for what they did to veterans, for what they did to seniors, forcing them to work longer and cutting their pensions. The Harper regime's primary goal was to ensure that the billionaires, the big banks and the wealthy CEOs had massive amounts of money. The Conservatives gave away $30 billion a year to overseas tax havens for the rich and the privileged. They gave $118 billion to the banks. They took that money from CMHC housing, which should have been a priority under the Harper regime. It was already in crisis, yet the Conservatives took that money from CMHC and gave it to the banks so they could get executive bonuses and dividends. They had an unbelievable track record. It was the worst government in Canadian history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712123">The Conservatives have offered up an amendment to their own motion. We are supporting the motion. We want to call Mr. Anderson before the bar. We want to do that because we were not able to do it during the Harper years. The Conservatives refused any sort of transparency. This is the second time that we will call a someone before the bar. We did the same thing for Mr. Firth. This is important for transparency. It is a tool that members of Parliament can use to ensure we get to the bottom of issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712124"> When we have unco-operative witnesses, then we can get the answers for which Canadians are asking. We supported the call to the bar for Kristian Firth. Because it is a parliamentary demand, the practice is, as the Speaker is well aware, to ensure that every recognized party, and in this case there was an allocation given to the Green Party, which is not a recognized party, as well, that all members of Parliament have an equitable distribution of questions. Therefore, we would think the Conservatives, if they were mature and not children, would approach this call to the bar in the same—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712134">Mr. Speaker, obviously, the truth hurts for Conservatives, and they cannot ignore their record. They cannot hide from their record and they cannot cover up their record like they did the myriad scandals that took place during the Conservative reign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712135">We have talked about Liberal scandals. The Conservative corruption needs to be read into the record to be believed. The ETS scandal was $400 million, stolen from seniors, veterans and people across the country who were just trying to make ends meet. The G8 scandal was $1 billion. We will remember the gazebos and we will remember how the Harper regime shut down any inquiry into that. They did not care about taxpayers' money then. The Phoenix pay scandal was $2.2 billion. The Liberals, ill-judged, continued on with the Phoenix pay scandal, and we see the results even today. That was $2.2 billion and Conservatives wear that. We will remember the anti-terrorism funding. The paper trail of $3.1 billion just disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712136">If we put all those numbers together, that is $7 billion misspent. No Conservative has ever apologized for it. No Conservatives have ever said that they were wrong to misspend billions and billions of dollars, that they were wrong to shut down Parliament so that we could not get to the bottom of it, and that this was something that they apologize for. I just want to hear one Conservative MP stand up and apologize for depriving veterans of basic services, forcing seniors to work years longer, slashing health care and slashing public safety funding so that, of course, criminals could prosper because there were no more crime prevention centres. The RCMP was cut back. CBSA was cut back. Conservatives have never apologized for that. Their record is absolutely deplorable and yet no Conservative MP is willing to stand up and say that they were wrong to do all that. Of course, how can we trust them today?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712137">As for the subamendment, where they very clearly want to take two-thirds of the questions, basically to deprive the rest of Parliament, we are not going to be supporting it. My final point is this. We do not want to go back to Conservative cover-ups, Conservative cuts, Conservative corruption and Conservative corporate tax cuts.</ParaText>

This is extremely important in Quebec. Before the last budget, the federal government announced a $250‑million fund to end encampments across the country. The Government of Quebec already has a plan to address homelessness in Quebec. Therefore, the federal government should give these funds to Quebec so that it can use them to end this major problem. However, the negotiations are getting bogged down. The federal government wants accountability. It wants to set conditions, and the negotiations are dragging on. Winter is around the corner. I would like to ask my colleague if he can put pressure on his friends in the Liberal government to bring the negotiations to a close and pay the money to Quebec so we can end the encampments before winter arrives.</ParaText>

We pushed for this for years, and the result was that the spring budget offered tens of billions of dollars for this issue. The NDP has been working on this problem for years, and we were able to improve things. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> fought to have funding go to Quebec, just as it does elsewhere in Canada, to ensure that there is affordable housing. We went through years of no investment under Liberal and Conservative governments, but the NDP finally managed to force the government to invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712147">I would like to say one more thing. My colleague raised important questions. In Quebec, 600,000 Quebeckers are already registered for the NDP's dental care plan. It is incredible. It is the highest registration rate in the country. Of course, nearly 100% of the dentists, denturists and dental hygienists in Quebec are participating in the NDP's dental care program. I hope my Bloc Québécois colleague will stop opposing this dental care plan, because it is making a huge difference in Quebeckers' daily lives.</ParaText>

Here we are, all of us MPs, coming back from our ridings where we went and paid respect to those who served in the military and RCMP, put their lives on the line to protect us and served our country. I am glad he talked about the amnesia down the bench on the Conservative side: when the<Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Official Opposition</Affiliation> was in cabinet, they cut a third of the employees at Veterans Affairs. It led to a backlog of tens of thousands of veterans with disabilities seeking disability benefits and waiting for the support they needed. The Conservatives also closed nine veterans' offices and fought veterans in court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712149">I will correct my colleague, because the Phoenix pay system was not $2.2 billion; it has now cost Canadian taxpayers over $3 billion.

The first was in 2016 for accepting a vacation on the Aga Khan's private island while the Aga Khan was lobbying the government. The second was for improperly pressuring the Attorney General during the SNC-Lavalin scandal to interfere in a prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712174">Similarly, the former finance minister breached ethics laws by failing to disclose ownership of a French villa held in a corporation and for overseeing federal dealings with WE Charity despite his family's financial ties to the organization. The former fisheries minister also violated conflict of interest rules by awarding a lucrative Arctic surf clam contract to a company linked to his wife's cousin. Additionally, the former minister of small business was found guilty of violating ethics laws for awarding a contract to a firm co-owned by her friend Amanda Alvaro.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712175">These cases underscore persistent issues of ethical lapses within the government.</ParaText>

I will give some background. While serving as minister, he co-owned Global Health Imports, GHI, a company that secured questionable government contracts. Despite his claiming to step away from the business, evidence leads to his continued involvement, ultimately violating ethics rules. His former business partner Stephen Anderson is now facing fraud charges, raising further questions about the misuse of taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>

Canadians deserve accountability, but the Liberal government continues to protect its own instead of delivering solid, ethical leadership that Canadians expect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712178">Before I get into the crux of the speech, I want to share for those listening that the conflict of interest rules require cabinet ministers to divest their controlled interests either by selling them or by placing them in a blind trust within 100 days of their appointment. They also forbid them from having any management or control over the trust assets. A minister would then be found to be breaking the law if they were found to have either managed or controlled the trust assets or the day-to-day business of the company itself.

              <ParaText id="8712180">The first set of text messages obtained by Global News showed that Stephen Anderson, the co-founder of GHI, transferred an urgent message from a certain Randy to Malvina Ghaoui, principal of a PPE company in California, to send a wire transfer of half a million dollars to secure a large shipment of nitrile gloves. The text reads, “it literally takes 10 seconds to complete a transfer.

Born in Scotland, John immigrated to Canada as a young man to continue a career in finance, working for the Royal Bank before starting his own accounting business. In 1993, he answered the call to serve his country and was elected as a Reform Party member of Parliament.</ParaText>

After retiring, he continued in public service, leading the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption. John was a mentor to me from when I was very young, and I will always remember our get-togethers at his farm outside Morinville.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712201">He will be dearly missed by all who knew him, particularly his wife Christine and his children, Allan, Munro and Vienna. John was also a man of deeply held Christian convictions, and his courageous stand for the truth, both secular and spiritual, will not be forgotten. He has served his country and his God well. May he rest in peace.</ParaText>

Our history is not void of failures that have caused immense harm to generations, both past and present. The CMHR plays a critical role in helping us move forward with hope and conviction in pursuit of a better world for all. I congratulate the CMHR on 10 years of service to our beautiful country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712371"> Mr. Speaker, it is disingenuous for the Conservatives to continually link the food bank situation in Canada with carbon pricing. A 108-page report produced by Food Banks Canada made four recommendations around Canada's social safety net. Not once in that 108-page report did it mention the carbon tax or carbon pricing, because it knows that Canada's carbon rebate, which comes out four times a year, supports Canadians, particularly lower and middle-income Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712478">This is an important issue. The second report of Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs is entitled, “Barriers to Economic Development in Indigenous Communities” and it was tabled back in April 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712479">The report's study highlights the ongoing challenges faced by indigenous peoples in Canada in achieving economic development, despite their right to self-determination. First nations, Inuit and Métis communities continue to experience significant socio-economic disparities when compared with non-indigenous people. This includes lower incomes, education levels, employment rates and property values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712480">The committee concluded that these disparities are largely the result of historical and systemic inequalities further exacerbated by federal policies and regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712481">In February 2022, the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs initiated a study aimed at identifying the barriers to indigenous economic development and exploring ways to eliminate them. Addressing these barriers could not only enhance outcomes for indigenous communities, but also contribute significantly to Canada's economy, potentially adding $30 billion to the national GDP by closing the socio-economic gap between indigenous and non-indigenous populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712482"> Witnesses to the study identified several critical barriers to indigenous economic development, including limited access to capital, inadequate infrastructure and, in some cases, a lack of capacity.

              <ParaText id="8712488">Madam Speaker, as I stated, several witnesses to this study identified several critical barriers to indigenous economic independence and development. We are talking about the issues of limited access to capital, inadequate infrastructure and, in some cases, lack of capacity. Of course, we go on to say that many indigenous communities are already working on their own solutions to these issues and they require further supports from the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712489"> Indigenous peoples have long been excluded from key decision-making processes, which has hindered their ability to fully participate in economic development. Clarence T. Jules, otherwise known as Manny Jules to many, chief commissioner of the First Nations Tax Commission, pointed out that indigenous peoples have lost control over their fiscal powers and lands as a result of these historical exclusions. Infrastructure is essential for driving indigenous economic development, serving as a backbone of a functional economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712490">Before I continue on with the reports, I would like to remind people that I am splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712491">Experts such as Clint Davis from Nunasi Corporation and Ernie Daniels of the First Nations Finance Authority have underscored the importance of closing the significant infrastructure gap, estimated at about $30 billion, between first nations and other Canadian communities. The Nunavut infrastructure gap report, for example, highlights critical shortages in water, housing, broadband and energy systems. The overall infrastructure gap for indigenous communities there could be as high as $70 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712492"> Housing, of course, is another urgent issue. Shannin Metatawabin from the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association has proposed the creation of an indigenous housing fund in partnership with aboriginal financial institutions. This fund would help secure financing for housing in indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712493"> Similarly, Grand Chief Jerry Daniels of the Southern Chiefs' Organization Inc. recommended offering long-term loan guarantees to support capital projects, including housing initiatives. To help bridge the infrastructure gap, Daniels has suggested exploring monetization as a funding approach. This method, commonly used by municipalities to finance projects, involves issuing debentures to raise capital for infrastructure and economic development. Daniels also proposed a pilot project to replace diesel generation in remote communities potentially funded through this model. This approach could not only reduce dependence on federal funding, but also provide a sustainable, clean energy solution while testing innovative financing strategies at a minimal cost to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712494"> The committee was informed that administrative obstacles pose significant challenges to indigenous economic development, especially when it comes to accessing public funding. Witnesses highlighted issues such as time-consuming and repetitive processes of submitting applications, as well as confusion around program eligibility requirements. To address these challenges, Harold Calla from the First Nations Financial Management Board proposed a pilot project aimed at streamlining administrative functions for smaller communities. Some of those smaller communities can lack the resources to manage such tasks efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712495"> Furthermore, Tabatha Bull from the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business recommended the creation of a navigator position to assist indigenous businesses in navigating government programs and grant applications. This role would help entrepreneurs identify relevant funding opportunities and support a need that has been frequently emphasized by indigenous business owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712496"> Witnesses also emphasized that the current funding for indigenous economic development is inadequate and often lacks the structure needed to foster long-term growth. Regional Chief Teegee called for a shift away from short-term program funding, advocating for more substantial and predictable financial support, particularly for areas like first nations policing. He stressed that this approach would also be extended to economic development initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712497"> Access to capital and equity was identified as another key barrier to indigenous economic progress.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712498"> Grand Chief Daniels of the Southern Chiefs' Organization highlighted that, without equity, indigenous communities face significant challenges in launching and sustaining wealth-building ventures. Securing capital, particularly for large-scale projects in sectors like energy, mining and agriculture, remains difficult due to historical disadvantages and bureaucratic obstacles. Chief Commissioner Manny Jules pointed out that indigenous peoples face a $175-billion gap in access to capital. Several leaders also underscored the mutual benefits of improving access to capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712499">Mr. Metatawabin announced that indigenous communities represent profitable investment opportunities. Although progress has been made, such as through impact benefit agreements, communities still encounter financial barriers that prevent full participation in major projects. Traditional lenders are unwilling to finance equity, leaving communities either unstable or unable to secure necessary funds or forced to accept costly, unfavourable terms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712500">Several witnesses emphasized the need to increase indigenous participation in public procurement and highlighted the ongoing barriers to achieving this very goal. In April 2022, the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> announced that 32 federal departments would be required to allocate at least 5% of federal contracts to indigenous-owned, indigenous-led businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712501">However, since then, the program has faced significant shortcomings. There have been reports of companies and individuals exploiting the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses, falsely claiming indigenous status in order to secure contracts. Some have even gone so far as to submit fraudulent documents, such as a picture of a rabbit, to qualify for the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712502">A particularly troubling issue involves the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">employment minister</Affiliation>'s past business dealings, specifically his connection to Global Health Imports. The company, co-owned by the employment minister, falsely represented itself as a wholly indigenous-owned business in order to obtain government contracts through Canada's indigenous procurement programs, programs designed to benefit indigenous communities. Such misrepresentation undermines the very purpose of the programs, which are intended to support indigenous peoples and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712503"> I could go on, but I will just wrap up by saying that there are many examples of indigenous entrepreneurship and initiative. Conservatives are inspired by their vision and their drive. A future Conservative government will partner with indigenous communities to realize their aspirations, and we will be laser-focused in fostering economic growth and creating opportunities for indigenous communities.</ParaText>

I am simply reminding the government that indigenous peoples have long been excluded from key decision-making events. An indigenous procurement program, which is supposed to uplift and benefit indigenous businesses, is now being taken advantage of, or at least it seems that way, by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">employment minister</Affiliation>, who checked off a box claiming to be indigenous but with no real evidence to even back that up.

              <ParaText id="8712508"> Madam Speaker, one of the issues we have dealt with in the northern Treaty 9 region is the incredible inequity faced in the communities themselves. In Attawapiskat, people are literally living almost on top of each other. There are no other communities up there except the Cree, yet the federal government and the provincial government of Doug Ford just refused to sit down to talk about a reserve extension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712509">However, when De Beers went up to open a diamond mine, all the permitting happened very quickly. What ended up happening was that there was within the community a sense that if the company was coming simply to extract the resources, the government was willing to come to the table. However, when there were basic issues like housing and the right to expand the reserves so we could build livable communities, neither the province, particularly Doug Ford, nor the federal government has come to the table. There are now lawsuits saying that they are going to stop economic development until they get those basic issues of inequity dealt with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712517"> Madam Speaker, at this point there can be very little doubt that the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>, who is the member for Edmonton Centre and Alberta's only member of the Liberal cabinet, willfully pretended to be indigenous. He should not be in cabinet. Of course, I know there are slim pickings among Alberta Liberals. They are either with the pretender or with the porch pirate, but the minister certainly should be out of cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712518">As a consequence of his pretense, the company that he co-owned also pretended to be indigenous-owned, and this pretense was used to advance the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s political image and potentially to advance his private commercial interests as well. Now that he has been found out, the minister should offer a more fulsome and sincere apology than the one he offered on Friday, and he should resign or be removed from cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712519">There is an Instagram post that the Liberal Party put out in 2016, one of many examples of things published at the time and since, that makes very clear how the minister was being positioned. The post in question proudly highlights that apparently the Liberals had elected the largest number of indigenous MPs ever and includes a picture that shows the indigenous Liberal caucus, photos of nine MPs, one of whom is the current <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712520">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has most recently claimed that he participated in the activities of the indigenous Liberal caucus but only as an ally. In other words, he says he never pretended to be indigenous; he just happened to be the one and only white guy who happened to be invited to an organization that identified as the indigenous Liberal caucus. Obviously, that does not pass a pretty basic smell test.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712521">There is a post saying that the Liberals had elected a significant number of indigenous MPs. It is accompanied by a collection of photos of MPs. That would surely be designed to give the impression that those MPs are indigenous. Why in the world would the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> be the one white guy in an otherwise all-indigenous club that was repeatedly publicly identified as in an all-indigenous club, unless he was trying to create the impression that he was indigenous?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712522">However, we do not even need Liberal Party social media posts in order to see the problem; let us look at the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s own words in the House. In 2016, he described himself as an “adopted Cree”. In 2018, he switched to calling himself a “non-status adopted Cree” and a “member of the indigenous caucus”. As recently as a year ago, the minister told the House that his Cree name means “strong eagle man”. There can surely be no doubt what this was supposed to convey, even as he was also talking about Métis family members and admitting, alternatively, that he was neither.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712523">The thing is that in listening to the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s damage control now, he sounds a lot like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. When pressed on the point of misidentification, at a press conference on Friday, he said that on the one hand, the Liberal Party had misunderstood, that he apologized if anyone was confused and that he is learning about his family history in real time. He did not at any point actually admit wrongdoing. He later said he was going to continue the journey and will share this journey with Canadians as he continues down that path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712524">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> sounded much like a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who thought a groping scandal was just a matter of someone experiencing things differently and who thought his own repeated wearing of racist costumes was a learning opportunity for the rest of us. The minister says he is on a journey, but actually I think the journey that most people want the minister to take is first to the backbenches and then out of Parliament entirely.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712639">Madam Speaker, I think it is worth recalling that on March 1, 2018, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> told this House, “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.” He actually said that in the House of Commons. That is what is going on here. The minister from Edmonton did not want to let the truth get in the way of what he thought would be a good political story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712640">Why exactly were these claims made? Why did the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> falsely claim to be indigenous? Perhaps this is another Liberal example of the Maryam Monsef method of selectively claiming to be unaware of key personal facts in order to help develop a more elaborate origin story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712641">Once upon a time, there were three brothers, Remus, Romulus and Randy, born of a union between the god Mars and a mortal, nursed in the woods by a wolf. After the brothers grew up, a lethal struggle for dominance ensued, and one of the brothers founded the great city of Rome. After founding Rome, he travelled halfway around the world to join the Liberal cabinet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712642">In other myths, he is identified as the son of Janus, the Roman god with two faces, although as more comes out, two faces may actually not be enough. He is the man, the myth, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>: “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712643">However, efforts at exaggerated personal myth-making may not be all there is to this. At present we are prosecuting the Liberals' indigenous contracting scandal, a scandal in which many companies made false or misleading claims about indigenous identity or developed creative arrangements to position themselves as technically indigenous without actually providing substantive economic benefit or opportunity to indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712644">For those who have not been following, the scandal is that Liberals established a 5% target and set-aside. Five per cent of government contracts had to go to indigenous companies, so what necessarily flows from having this kind of target is the need to define what is an indigenous company. This kind of work defining indigenous companies is going on elsewhere, because it is not just governments that are looking to include indigenous businesses with procurement opportunities. Many private sector companies, especially in the energy sector, are looking to procure more from indigenous businesses and include indigenous businesses in their supply chains. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712645">Private sector companies are not looking to just check a legal box. They are doing this voluntarily because it is good business and because it gives impacted communities a greater stake in the success of projects. Private sector proponents, though not perfect, have sought ways to define in an authentic way what are indigenous businesses and the extent to which there are real positive economic impacts in the communities they want to work with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712646">There are currently various organizations, such as the Canadian Council for Indigenous Business, that work with the private sector to help identify and support indigenous businesses. I have also met with the Indigenous Chamber of Commerce in Winnipeg, which has a rigorous process of assessing whether a business is truly indigenous-owned before it is admitted to its membership roles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712647">However, bizarrely, the Liberal government chose not to work with existing organizations to draw on the various lists that have been created for indigenous businesses. Instead, it developed its own list, which suspiciously appears to include a number of actors as indigenous businesses that are not on anyone else's list. While many in the private sector want to do this for real, the Liberal government has sought to inflate the number of contracts going to indigenous businesses by including businesses on its list that are not actually indigenous and are not on anyone else's indigenous business list. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712648">The Assembly of First Nations has said that a majority of those getting the 5% set-aside are shell companies. There is abuse of joint ventures and shell companies and outright pretending. In one example in the news recently, a company called the Canadian Health Care Agency, a large non-indigenous company, went into joint venture with one person who was also its employee. The Canadian Health Care Agency was able to get many contracts. It got all of the benefit associated with these so-called joint ventures as a non-indigenous company and was able to deceptively position itself as an indigenous company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712649">We have been prosecuting this scandal for a while, and the AFN and other indigenous leaders have been so clear that this is a grave problem, an abuse of this policy that the Liberals have turned a blind eye to. However, we did not know until recently that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">employment minister</Affiliation>'s company was actually falsely trying to position itself as indigenous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712678">It is quite striking to hear him talk about self-serving tactics.

That is incredibly inappropriate and self-serving, and it hurts indigenous entrepreneurs and indigenous communities, which are supposed to benefit.

              <ParaText id="8712692"> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and add some thoughts on an issue that has always been of great importance to the Government of Canada and, in particular, to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712693"> We have talked about the whole issue of reconciliation and how, as a government, we have ensured significant budget commitments over the years, but also legislative actions in a very tangible way. I am going to expand on that shortly. Before I do that, I do not want anyone who might be following this debate to believe that the Conservatives are genuinely concerned about the report itself at all. All one needs to do is take a look at the previous member's comments on the report and then reflect on what was being debated earlier today. I would suggest that the whole concept of character assassination has something in common with this. This is more about a multi-million dollar game the Conservatives have played for many weeks, at a great cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712694">Substantial legislation is waiting to be debated, both from the government's perspective and from the perspective of private members. However, instead of having that form of debate, the Conservatives continue to bring in concurrence reports to fill time because they are running out of things to say on their privilege motions. Here they have taken a particular issue that has always been important to the government. At the end of the day, I question their motivation for choosing to use this issue as a political game to add to the multi-million dollar filibuster that we have been witnessing for many weeks and, unfortunately, in all likelihood, for many days to come. I look at this from a perspective of lost opportunities and why we need to move on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712695">When I think of the issue at hand, I think of individuals like Cindy Woodhouse. I think of the passing of Mr. Sinclair, an individual, second to no other in Manitoba, who brought forward the debate on indigenous reconciliation for all Canadians and the important role we all have to play, including here in the House. I was at the funeral, as members from all political parties were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712696">When the TRC report came out, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation> at the time, because it was back in 2015, made the commitment to act on every one of those 94 calls for action. We have seen significant gains. Many have taken the form of legislation that has passed, such as a statutory holiday, indigenous languages and legislation dealing with children. We have also seen significant financial commitments, somewhere in the neighbourhood of $400-plus million toward indigenous entrepreneurs and others since 2015 to encourage partnerships. In the 2024 budget, in fact, we committed $350 million to dealing with issues to increase access to capital.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712697">I think of my home province of Manitoba and the city of Winnipeg, and the only way we can hit the potential that our province has in the federation is to see reconciliation work. A part of that is to recognize the entrepreneurs and the workers and how, as a national government, we can contribute to it. One of the first things we took initiative on, for example, was the issue of Freedom Road, something Shoal Lake 40 was asking for for many years. Stephen Harper, throughout those years when the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was a cabinet minister with Stephen Harper, said, “No, the federal government does not support Freedom Road.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712698"> It took a change in government. It was not until the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> formed the cabinet, and with the support of the national Liberal caucus, that we ultimately saw financing for Freedom Road. Freedom Road has had a profoundly positive impact for Shoal Lake 40. It is not because of Ottawa but more because of the leadership from within the Shoal Lake 40 reserve. These are the people who deserve the credit. What we did as government was recognize the potential and get behind the individual chief and council to ultimately enable it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712699"> We have seen other very successful projects at Shoal Lake 40. They are significant projects, all of which, I would suggest, are indigenous led, from the companies to the workers to the quality that we see, including the water treatment facility. For the community's size, it is a world-class facility, which is there today because of indigenous-led companies and the chief and council. We could also talk about the twinning of Highway 17. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712700">I look at individuals like Sharon Redsky, who often affords me the opportunity to better understand indigenous issues, especially around children and social enterprises and the potential for charitable groups and indigenous organizations to contribute to reconciliation. These are individuals. I think of Chief Kevin Redsky and the leadership the chief and council provide, and how that is making a difference. We as a government have supported that leadership and those developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712701"> I would suggest that the Conservatives are introducing the report today not because the Conservatives care about the issue. It has more to do with the same sort of subject matter they are talking about with the privilege issue. Let us ask ourselves, have the Conservatives ever, in the last number of years, raised this issue in the form of an opposition day motion? The short answer is no, they have not.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712702">The only reason the Conservatives are raising it today is that, in going through the 100-plus reports, they said it was an issue that they could politicize. They could stand up and continue on with the character assassination of a particular minister. That is their motivation. It is not because they are concerned about indigenous issues. I did not witness that in the last speech by the Conservative member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712703">Just last week, I had the opportunity to participate in an organization called Raising the Roof. I understand that it actually originated in the province of Ontario. It is a wonderful group. It ensures that it is building a number of homes for non-profits. It ventured into Winnipeg, Manitoba, for the very first time. There was a substantial federal contribution to it, and I had the opportunity to participate in the announcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712704"> What touched me most in regard to that was the fact that there was a company, Purpose Construction, which is responsible for doing the renovations of a particular home that happens to be in Winnipeg North. It is on Mountain Avenue in what I would classify as the core, traditional, heritage-rich north end of Winnipeg. What would have been a dilapidated two-storey-plus home has now been converted into a wonderful place to call home, not for one, but actually two families. From what I understand, it also has a third area; this is maybe not necessarily for a family, but it could be for someone who is coming in and studying or whatever it might be. We will see that it is for the homeless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712705">There is another organization, Siloam Mission; this is actually the group that is going to be responsible for, from what I can recall, ensuring that there are tenants going into the facility and managing the facility. They are indigenous tenants. However, I will get back to Purpose Construction because it is more than just the federal government that is increasing the number of homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712706">Purpose Construction is an indigenous company that is taking indigenous workers and allowing them to learn a trade and supporting that. The benefits of this particular facility, or home, that is being built go far beyond just providing another home for a couple of families and others. It is touching the community in a very real way, and it is supporting indigenous-led companies and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712707">We should keep in mind that the Conservative Party does not support housing initiatives. Most recently, we have seen that with the housing accelerator fund, wherein the federal government is working with other municipalities to ensure that we get more homes built. Many Conservatives are saying that they like that particular program. They are writing to ministers. If there are 18 of them writing, I can only imagine how many others actually support it but are not writing to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712708"> I suspect that the housing announcement by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, which I have labelled as a dud, demonstrates how it is that the Conservative Party treats supporting indigenous communities. I could talk at great length in regard to the housing issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712709">Let us move on to the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Even today, I believe I have heard at least one Conservative member say they want to get rid of the Canada Infrastructure Bank. The Conservative Party's official position on the Canada Infrastructure Bank is to get rid of it. If we dig a little deeper, they will give misinformation. They will say that the Canada Infrastructure Bank does not do anything. There are billions of dollars of investments through the Canada Infrastructure Bank that have led to more billions of dollars of investments from other stakeholders. We are talking around $30 billion. The last time I checked, it was getting close to $30 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712710">If we check with the Canada Infrastructure Bank, we will see that the bank has an indigenous equity initiative that is enabling indigenous leaders to tap in and become partners on infrastructure development. There are projects there. How does the Conservative Party of Canada and its shiny new <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> respond to that? They say that the Canada Infrastructure Bank is a bad idea and that they are going to cut it, just as they say they are going to cut the housing accelerator fund. Their policies are very much dictated by the far right in Canada. We know that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712711">The progressive nature that used to be in the Conservative Party has completely evaporated; it is more focused on cuts. If we were to broaden it out to expand beyond indigenous communities and just focus on cuts and why they are so relevant, the Conservative Party tries to give the false impression that it cares about indigenous communities; in fact, we know that it is going to cut indigenous funds that are now flowing. </ParaText>

The Conservatives are going to cut the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which is helping fund some of these capital projects. They are going to cut it, yet they say they are not going to cut it. They are going to cut the housing accelerator fund. Are they trying to tell me that indigenous communities do not benefit through that fund, that there will not be social enterprises, such as Purpose Construction, that are going to participate in renovations and the building of homes? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712714">The Conservative Party needs to reflect and hold its own far-right Conservative <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> to account for the careless cuts that it continues to propose all the time, whether the ones I have talked about already or cuts to dental care, pharmacare or child care. That is the Conservative Party today, and it does need to be held to account for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712715">The Conservatives bring forward motions for concurrence, not because they are interested in the subject matter but because they are trying to show that the House of Commons is dysfunctional. That is the real purpose of what they are doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712716">If we read the motion, Conservatives want to extend it beyond the chamber to standing committees.

              <ParaText id="8712747">Madam Speaker, we are here today to talk about an issue that is fundamental for the future of Canada and Quebec, and that is economic development in indigenous communities. The report of the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs reminds us of the barriers that these communities face and that make it so that the desired outcomes are not always achieved as originally planned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712748">This is a critical issue, but it is also a mirror that reflects the systemic challenges that are deeply rooted in our society. Reconciliation will not be possible without eliminating the barriers that continue to prevent first nations, Métis and Inuit people from receiving a fair share of this country's wealth. This is not just a matter of social justice. It is also a matter of economic development for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712749">Barriers to economic development in indigenous communities include the legacy of colonialism, the failure to recognize indigenous jurisdiction, inadequate infrastructure, administrative burdens, limited access to capital, and limited access to federal procurement opportunities. First nations, Inuit and Métis face similar barriers, but they are also confronted with challenges that are unique to their situation and their relationship with the federal government. Financial challenges are systemic barriers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712750">One of the major barriers we face is access to funding. Take, for example, the down payment required for any new project in an indigenous context. It is a minimum of 10%, a requirement that does not take into account the economic realities of these communities, where many people live below the poverty line. Under these conditions, how can anyone hope to undertake an economic development initiative, be it commercial or residential, if the down payment is an insurmountable barrier?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712751">However, there is a solution in the Yänonhchia' program. This innovative solution is available in Quebec. Not only does it give the middle class on first nations lands access to home ownership, but it also stimulates a unique market for high-quality properties in various communities. We asked the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to provide funding at the earliest opportunity for this program, which helps members of communities in need finally get a roof over their heads. The message is clear: It is important to set the right priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712752">In addition, access to private capital continues to be a major challenge. With few exceptions, financial institutions continue to show clear mistrust toward indigenous businesses, making it extremely difficult for them to access credit. This situation is even more complex in remote communities, where transportation and material costs make projects considerably more expensive. These disadvantages mean that even the simplest construction project in indigenous communities like Wemotaci or Chisasibi will invariably be more expensive than in cities like Montreal or Quebec City. It is not just a difference in costs, it is a systemic inequality that hinders development projects from the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712753">Red tape is another factor hindering growth. The administrative burden created by governments, both federal and provincial, should not be underestimated. Funding programs are complex and poorly adapted to the realities of indigenous workers and entrepreneurs. In many cases, an application has to be submitted several times to different departments, resulting in lengthy delays and missed opportunities. This cumbersome bureaucracy only slows down the development of indigenous initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712754">We need a more flexible, responsive approach. Decisions need to be made faster. Most importantly, the reality of indigenous communities must be taken into account in the funding allocation process. Continuing to apply rigid processes designed in urban centres is not going to solve the issue of economic development for indigenous peoples. We need decentralization, a redistribution of decision-making powers and real political will to facilitate, not impede, first nations development for and by first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712755">Geographic isolation is also a factor in economic exclusion. As we know, indigenous communities face unique, often invisible, but deeply structural barriers. They do not all experience the same realities. Some are close to urban areas and are in a better position to meet program requirements. Others, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer wisely pointed out, have difficulties that are not taken into account, such as geographic isolation. This leads to exorbitant supplier costs and creates glaring inequalities between regions. These are known as remoteness costs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712756">Let us not forget that many of these communities are located in remote regions, where access to infrastructure and basic services is still a survival issue. This translates into extra supplier costs, but also a lack of access to economic opportunities, federal contracts, and sometimes even adequate banking or financial services. Indigenous populations are doubly penalized, both by their remoteness and by the systemic indifference of the government, which does not adapt its policies to meet their specific needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712757">Economic reconciliation is a necessity for all. It is essential to remember that economic reconciliation is not possible without the active participation of indigenous peoples in the Canadian economy. Reconciliation is about more than symbolic statements or gestures. It requires meaningful action and financial commitments. Studies show that if indigenous communities had the same economic opportunities as the other Canadians, the Canadian economy as a whole would benefit considerably. Canada could increase its GDP significantly, by $30 billion to $100 billion annually, simply by allowing indigenous people to access equitable employment conditions, training and funding. It is in everyone's interest to remove barriers to indigenous economic inclusion. We are not asking for a favour here. We are offering an opportunity that must be seized for the good of all of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712758">The proposed opportunities are a way forward. To overcome these barriers, we must work together. It is imperative that the Government of Canada implement policies and strategies that take the realities of indigenous peoples into account. Obviously, this entails implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, in collaboration with the communities, and formally recognizing indigenous legal frameworks for the management of their lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712759">The government also needs to support the creation and expansion of indigenous financial institutions that can meet the specific needs of indigenous businesses. The aboriginal financial institution network needs to be strengthened and adequately funded to foster access to capital and support the growth of indigenous businesses. Finally, it is crucial to review federal funding and procurement mechanisms to allow for genuine and equitable participation by indigenous businesses in major infrastructure and development projects in Canada. Indigenous initiatives funds must be tailored to the specific needs of each community, taking geographic, social and economic aspects into consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712760">Economic reconciliation also requires solid land bases. The Bloc Québécois has long been calling on the federal government to commit to land reform, and we will continue to push for that as long as necessary. We suggest partnering with indigenous groups to undertake a vast nation-to-nation effort to sign agreements and treaties that are entered into freely and are mutually agreed upon, allowing for more self-determination for these communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712761">We propose that the comprehensive land claims policy be completely overhauled, which would include creating an independent entity to manage and resolve these claims. Appointing a commissioner, as set out in Bill <Document DbId="13316117" Type="3">C‑77</Document>, is a step in the right direction, because the federal government is not only slow, it is often a bad partner. Of course, the commissioner will be able to point all that out, but that should not stop the federal government from taking action now. Two weeks ago, when the ministers appeared before the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, none of these crucial issues were addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712762">It currently takes 18 years on average to settle a land claim, including two years seeking government approvals. This creates a significant financial burden for first nations. That is already excessively long, but for some nations, the process can take up to 30 years. We are talking about three decades. These barriers sometimes lead communities to give up and settle for the Indian Act as the lesser of two evils. This policy needs to be addressed urgently because it impedes true, equal partnerships between nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712763">Since 2018, repealing the Indian Act has been one of the objectives of the relationship framework between the Government of Canada and indigenous peoples. However, the Liberal government is being too passive on this issue. In Quebec, only the Cree and Naskapi nations have been emancipated from this act, thanks to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and the resulting legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712764">When it comes to land claims, the situation in Quebec is similar to the one in British Columbia, where a large part of the territory is still not covered by treaties. This is problematic because the comprehensive land claim settlement process is excessively long and costly. It frustrates many first nations representatives without contributing toward improving living conditions in the communities. Furthermore, these negotiations create an extremely significant financial burden for indigenous communities. Currently, they are financed through a combination of repayable loans and non-repayable contributions. In 2013, the accrued debt, with interest, was $817 million. This funding model acts as a disincentive for communities, prolongs negotiations and forces some nations to give up when they run out of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712765">The problems with this policy do not stop there. The federal government is both judge and jury in these negotiations. The process is so long that negotiators frequently come and go, increasing delays even further, because each new negotiator has to get up to speed on the complex files. Furthermore, these negotiators have no flexibility and constantly have to ask the government to approve their decisions. In short, the existing process does not resolve disputes efficiently or help eliminate colonial structures such as the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712766">With respect to the additions to reserve policy, it is important to have sufficient funds to enable the 20 or so communities recognized by the federal government to complete the process set out in the policy so they can finally receive the funding they need to ensure the well-being of their members with complete peace of mind. Can the government assure us that there will be enough money this year to enable them to take action? Three first nations in my riding, which is in Quebec, have been displaced. They still have no stable land base. This is unacceptable. I would like to see those communities get their fair share. Too often, they are overlooked. I want to name them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712767">They are Timiskaming First Nation, Winneway first nation and Hunter's Point first nation, now Wolf Lake.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8712768">In this context, I want to underscore the following. This means that there is money that is not going to areas such as health, childhood education or an indigenous police service. It takes too long. Every time there is a hiccup, it seems like everyone is fine with that. At some point there needs to be action. Everyone will need to sit down together and offer solutions. Far too often, first nations issues are put on ice. The government will use any excuse to walk away from the negotiations, and often the real reason is that it just is not listening. Finally, things are left to drag on. Generations have been waiting for answers and results. That is another way to promote self-determination for indigenous peoples, especially back home in Abitibi—Témiscamingue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712769">The Inuit and Métis also deserve better representation within bodies that reflect on economic reconciliation. The Inuit of Nunavut or Nunavik, like the Red River Métis, are not subject to the Indian Act. However, these indigenous people have unique realities that deserve to be addressed by this government. They need to be better represented within the institutions and organizations set up by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712770">While the Red River Métis are now recognized as an indigenous people by the Government of Canada, they continue to face significant challenges in accessing financial resources and economic opportunities due to the delayed recognition of their rights and the federal government's broken promises. For a long time, they have been excluded from the funding and economic development programs available to other indigenous groups. While progress has been made in recent years, these commitments remain lacking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712771">Despite these barriers, Métis people have shown remarkable resilience and a great potential to develop their own economic initiatives and institutions. However, the lack of appropriate channels for distributing funds and delays in implementing supportive policies continue to impede their ability to build sustainable infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712772">The federal government absolutely must keep its promises and put in place funding mechanisms and institutions specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Métis people so that they can fully participate in the Canadian economy and ensure a prosperous future for their communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712773">I will digress for a moment. On the weekend, we marked Louis Riel Day. If there is something that Canada should think about, it is how it treated one of its own. The case of Louis Riel is well documented, and we should think about and look back at that history. I think that we have erred for too long. I want to acknowledge president David Chartrand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712774">Since I only have a little time left, I want to take this opportunity to raise some issues that I think are problematic when it comes to the economic development of first nations. I want to talk about the much-touted 5%. I am talking about recommendation 8 of the report. It is all well and good to say that the government awards 5% of federal contracts to indigenous businesses. However, when it comes to things like GC Strategies or projects like the one in Chalk River that is going to have a major impact on nuclear safety in Quebec and Canada, the indigenous component is often being managed by people who are not really indigenous. They have access to government funds and they are the ones who communicate with the government. The government can then say that it consulted indigenous people in the context of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. However, these indigenous impersonators are not recognized by indigenous people. That is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712775">“Pretendians” are people who self-identify as indigenous for economic or personal gain. In many cases, it may be a historical error. It is not necessarily a deliberately false claim. However, there are some serious problems at the moment. Fake indigenous claims are being used to gain access to contracts or to earn social licence. Think about the Chalk River project. An association known as the Algonquins of Ontario helped ensure social licence. Meanwhile, the Anishinabe in both Quebec and Ontario, plus 140 municipalities, are opposed to the project. Those who speak for the indigenous people are not the indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712776">There is no shortage of examples when it comes to economic development. Bastien Industries produces moccasins that are made in Wendake. This is an example of an economic development project where products are made by hand, with knowledge being passed on from generation to generation. It is an economic driver and source of pride for the community. Unfortunately, the company has no access to government contracts, and yet if the indigenous people who work there want to sell their products in the United States, they will be asked for their Indian status card.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712777">That is not possible in Canada. Those mechanisms do not exist and so identities can be claimed. These companies take second place when contracts are awarded. There is no obligation to do business with indigenous peoples. Actually, the law says there is in theory, but in practice, no mechanism exists. That is a fundamental problem. The Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates is particularly interested in this. I think we need to delve deeper into the issue of who is indigenous and who is not. At some point, this has a major impact on economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712778">I also want to take this opportunity to raise another issue. To me, it is one of the main solutions. The Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs examines it in this report, particularly in the first recommendations. In my opinion, the major solution, which is a philosophical one, is to trust the knowledge of the first nations and develop projects “by and for” indigenous nations. Right now, there are a lot of recommendations. However, I am shocked to see that the study is almost two years old. It is something we have thought about, but not a thing has changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712779">This government is on its last legs. It had plenty of time to take action and develop investment funds by and for indigenous peoples. Yänonhchia' comes to mind, along with the initiatives of NACCA, the National Aboriginal Capital Corporation Association, and many others that will provide financial leverage. The government puts structures in place, but often this only creates obstacles and barriers. Basically, indigenous communities are given two years to build a house. However, it takes time to get an architect to approve things. It is much harder to find one in remote areas and in indigenous communities. By the time an architect is found, the deadlines have passed. That is how it works at the federal government. Perhaps only two houses a year per community end up being built. Indigenous populations are growing quickly, and the needs of communities are not currently being met. Some serious reflection is needed, and the solution involves projects by and for indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712780">In conclusion, urgent action is essential. We have an historic opportunity before us. Removing barriers to economic development for indigenous peoples is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic one. We have a responsibility to right the wrongs of the past and to work together to build a prosperous future for all Canadian and Quebec communities, indigenous and otherwise. Indigenous peoples must be fully integrated into the economy of Canada and Quebec, not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it is in everyone's best interest. If we want a prosperous, inclusive and truly reconciled Quebec and Canada, we need to invest in the prosperity of indigenous peoples.</ParaText>

It is an economic development success story, perhaps the best in Canada. In fact, this week I met with Ted Moses, given that the Secretariat to the Cree Nation Abitibi-Témiscamingue Economic Alliance gathered in Val-d'Or. It was a pleasure to talk to him.

              <ParaText id="8712786">Yes, the Government of Quebec took action. There was the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, the Hydro‑Québec development. This provided financial levers by and for the Cree, which is now obviously one of the most powerful nations in terms of its economic development. The peace of the braves, by the Parti Québécois, reinforced that. I want to commend Bernard Landry and Ted Moses for their lasting leadership that had a major impact on the generations and the Cree. We see towns like Chisasibi still developing. Other communities need to find inspiration in that. There need to be more modern treaties, more autonomy the first nations.</ParaText>

In fact, the indigenous affairs committee had ministers before it who simply refused to answer questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712788">In committee, all opposition parties agreed to order ministers, in particular the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>, back to committee to actually answer those questions.

              <ParaText id="8712789">It is clear why the government is complaining about this. It does not want its ministers to appear before committee to be held accountable.

I think this is one area in my colleague's motion that is worth exploring to encourage greater support. I believe we have a responsibility to take an even closer look at the people who are being given power and money. This affects a huge number of people.

              <ParaText id="8712813">Madam Speaker, I want to thank all my colleagues for this important discussion today on the economic barriers that are leading to detrimental impacts on indigenous communities to better serve themselves, their community and all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712814">It is not too far in our own history that we looked to indigenous innovation for immense solutions to everyday problems. For example, the baby jumper is something that was invented by an indigenous woman right here in Canada. It is a significant contribution that most indigenous and non-Indigenous children would have access to. Indigenous entrepreneurs and indigenous economic motivators are critical to the success of Canada. However, that being said, there are immense barriers to these kinds of achievements by indigenous people, which is why it is so often the case that they find themselves in difficult circumstances to keep their businesses and operations afloat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712815">The indigenous and northern affairs committee was asked to study the barriers to indigenous economic development and highlighted a few key aspects of what that could mean within the report. However, I would like to focus today on what we find in the recommendations and speak to some of the challenges we are seeing here in Ottawa. For example, there is the infrastructure gap, and I will be touching on this important deficit, which is largely contributing to indigenous people having less access to our economy. Let me put it into perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712816"> Within the immense supply chain in our country there are, for example, railroads, two bands of steel right across the country, but this kind of economic infrastructure in the supply chain is very difficult for indigenous people to participate in when they are so far from infrastructure inputs to get their product to market. Indigenous communities make up an immense part of the economies in northern Alberta, northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba and northern British Columbia, but they are still finding the lack of infrastructure a critical barrier. For example, the deficit for infrastructure is over $350 billion for first nations communities and $75 billion for Inuit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712817">There is a $2.5-billion deficit for infrastructure, and indigenous people have been simply left behind for generations. It is time we catch up. We need a government that is willing to invest in infrastructure to see these communities truly flourish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712818">Another topic I would like to address is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It is true that although economic development in Canada has largely taken place without the consent of indigenous people, we are now on a path that would see indigenous people participate better in the economic development drivers of our country. However, there are still immense barriers to this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712819">We see, time and time again, that when a first nations, Métis or Inuit community says no, the government ignores it. Indigenous people have fought tooth and nail to see the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples truly adhered to. This gives indigenous people the great ability not just to say yes to projects that benefit them, but to also say no. This is the biggest contrast and challenge that indigenous people have, particularly with Conservative and Liberal governments. Time and time again, indigenous issues and indigenous people are only important when it is convenient to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712820">This particular case is another one of those instances where indigenous people have now taken the floor of the House of Commons to speak to the very interesting and deep challenges related to economic development. However, it is against the backdrop of an important moment in our House of Commons where we are being stalemated, because of several instances of concurrence in this place to slow down government legislation, which I understand completely. However, I also understand, and want to point out, that this debate today is critical and should not be taking place on the backs of other critical pieces of work and legislation. This is an important topic, and we have a moment now to speak to it. I would hope that the government representatives are listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712821">We have a serious issue with the final topic I will address today, which is indigenous procurement. To back up a bit, procurement for indigenous people is done through a federal program called PSIB, the indigenous business support program, which allows indigenous people to bid on procurement items. When the government is looking for talent acquisition, it would create an offer, have indigenous people bid, and then the successful indigenous company would administer that program. It sounds wonderful. It is a great thing for indigenous businesses, should they be allowed to fairly participate. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712822">There is no framework today that would put the indigenous procurement strategy of the government to a higher standard, one that would not be forcing the Assembly of First Nations to call for real reform within procurement. It would not be that the victims of the lack of procurement are those indigenous businesses, which are the real victims here. It is the indigenous businesses that have done everything right, that played by the rules, that signed all the papers and that got the congratulations and a pat on the back for incorporating their company, only to be met by a system that is rigged by the government and that has benefited, in this particular case, someone named Randy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712823">This is an obvious instance that requires the government's immediate attention. We need to get directly to the bottom of what has been taking place in the indigenous procurement processes of the government. It is time for someone to be held accountable for the pretendianism that continues to propagate right across this country. Whether it is in social media, in traditional media, in businesses or right here in the House of Commons, there are people who are falsely claiming to be indigenous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712824">I had a conversation with my sister when the story came up, and she smiled at me and she said that if people want to be indigenous so badly, they should also suffer the consequences. What a thing to say. Today, the lack of access to indigenous business support is the consequence. Being disproportionately impacted by poverty is the condition indigenous people are in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712825">Can members imagine how much of a slap in the face it is when there is a member of the cabinet claiming to be indigenous for the purposes of accessing an indigenous procurement strategy? That is the issue pertaining to indigenous procurement today. It requires the immediate attention of the government. The AFN, indigenous leaders and, as someone made mention, Métis people are also calling for justice. How can anyone have faith in a system that allows for non-indigenous people's applications to even be heard, let alone eventually accepted and part of the government's procurement process? It is very serious indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712826"> I want to speak to the important and critical aspects of the report as it pertains to indigenous self-determination. Indigenous people in Canada have always been subject to a unique relationship. Ever since the onset of colonization in North America, it has always been one of economic coercion. Economic coercion is the story and history of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712827"> We do not even have to look all that far. In my own lifetime, I have heard stories from elders who remember the days of the crooked and greedy Hudson's Bay Company. It was a monopoly here in North America that took such great advantage of indigenous people that there are horrific stories, whether of the delivery of small pox blankets or whether of the fact that indigenous people had to trap so many furs, up to the height of a rifle. That was the cost of it. There was extreme greed by the companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712828">What is a shame to hear today is the fact that companies continue in that tradition, whether they are huge, immense, giant natural resource companies that say they would rather sue the nation than work with it, like we have seen in northern Alberta, or whether it is governments getting in the direct way of indigenous people trying to get access to real economic benefit, like what is taking place in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712829">In southwest Calgary, Canada's largest first nation development, the Tsuut'ina Nation, is building a master-planned community on 1,200 acres of its land. The $10-billion, mixed-use project will feature 17 million square feet of real estate, including more than 6,500 residential units. However, there are issues related to the ability to permit it by the provincial government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712830"> Now the nation is waiting. It has been waiting and waiting for the government to give it the green light, when it is the nation of those lands. Original stewards have always built homes on their lands since time immemorial, and today a province is saying no. That is limiting economic business and economic opportunity for indigenous people, just as much as pretending to be indigenous for the purpose of trying to access capital. Over and over again we see instances of indigenous entrepreneurs being sidelined, whether in the case of provincial governments, as I just mentioned; in this case, with a federal government program that was meant to help indigenous entrepreneurs in procurement; or in the case of upholding indigenous people's rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712831">We often talk about economic reconciliation, a buzzword from my Conservative colleagues, who most particularly want to talk about access to natural resources. I understand this very well, coming from a natural resource community myself, an area that I worked in for quite a long time. I know how these debates go with companies. When companies come in, they are hoping to get a $3,000 barbecue so we do not have to talk about beneficial ownership. I know exactly what it means when a company comes in and says it is going to use our roads and not pay for any operations or maintenance. I know exactly what it means when a company says it is going to give us a sweetheart deal today and walk out 10 years later, leaving the community with a mess to clean up costing billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712832">These are the real economic barriers facing indigenous people, and these are issues we do not talk about. We do not talk about them because of the deep desire to see a partisan benefit. Anytime we talk about indigenous issues in this place, with the Liberals and the Conservatives, it is always about how they can score one on indigenous people. We have to end this. We have to be critical of these issues. Hopefully, we can unite as a House toward a process that deals with indigenous people as the rightful and beneficial owners of their lands and come to a real conclusion, a united conclusion, in the House saying that Canada must respect fundamental rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712833">I would like to speak now for a moment about the importance of treaties. Canada undertook, in the 1870s and 1880s, until the late 1920s, a process of historic treaty-making. For the better knowledge of my colleagues, there are several eras of treaties we can delineate. For the topic of this discussion, we are talking about the numbered treaties. For the numbered treaties, one of which I am from, Treaty No. 6, benefits were allocated throughout treaty negotiations and for the treaties themselves. However, the government, as soon as it signed these treaties, walked away and said, no, it knows better and that since it had the land, it is going to legislate these people, put down the Indian Act and never hear of the treaties again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712834">Today, we are in the courts. The Liberal government and the federal Conservatives have had a whole lifetime of lawsuits against indigenous people based on this decision. There is the clean water legislation, for example. Having clean drinking water would fundamentally increase indigenous people's access to the economy. A federal piece of legislation on that was struck down by the courts when the Conservatives tried to defend it. A Conservative piece of legislation that was struck down for being unconstitutional is now being replaced with another piece of legislation by the Liberals that is barely an improvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712835">These are the issues we are talking about. This incremental justice results in massive injustices for indigenous people while we wait and wait and children go by without anything. That is why it is so critical that we speak to the real challenges facing economic development for indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712836">Part of the real issue is capital. The Indian Act, for example, delineates very small, postage stamp pieces of land. For indigenous people to truly be stewards of an economy that is for their own people, their land must grow. The fact that we have reserved them to small, postage stamp pieces of property is an abomination. We must end the apartheid that exists in Canada. We must end the racial legislation that exists under the Indian Act. We must empower indigenous people toward their own destiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712837">For thousands of years, indigenous people have traded up and down the St. Lawrence, up and down North America, all the way from Mexico to Tuktoyaktuk, bringing goods and services to people right across this great place. However, the ugly horrors of racism and discrimination clamped down on Canada as the boats of Europe arrived.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712838">Europeans limited indigenous peoples' dignity by saying that they were savage. Today, we reject this term in the hope that we can see indigenous people like me, and like those right across this country, as the true stewards of this place. They are the ones who understand this land and who will hopefully save it from a climate crisis that continues to ravage the world and, most importantly, indigenous people, who are on the front lines of much of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712839">There is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a meaningful framework, first ushered in by one of the greatest advocates in Canada, an Alberta first nations chief by the name of Dr. Wilton Littlechild, who is a fantastic and remarkable living giant from Alberta. The nations he serves are largely nations that are in the resource-rich provinces, including my home province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712840">We have never, at any point in time, have had to delineate between the unfortunate dichotomy that now exists between resource development and resource non-development. These kinds of questions presuppose indigenous peoples' interests. Perhaps indigenous peoples' interests are for their land mass to grow, for example. How do we get to the point of having conversations with indigenous people about their desires? Instead, we have a government that continually wants access to indigenous peoples' resources and lands, and it is finding every single way to do it, even though the courts and the international community have been clear that indigenous people have a fundamental right to their lands and a say in its use. That includes the right to say no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712841">These are fundamental rights that would ensure clarity for industrial partners. That is what I have been hearing from resource development companies, in particular. They just want clarity. If they can find a way to get clarity on who has those consultative rights, then perhaps those companies, including those of indigenous people, would not have to settle these disputes in court. This would require a government that would be willing to understand and implement treaties in a number of treaty areas. It would also require the government to act in earnest in areas where there is no treaty, fully recognizing that they are indigenous lands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712842">When we do not recognize this, there is a cost and a consequence. As a matter of fact, we saw this cost and consequence manifest during the last Parliament, when we saw one of the most historic instances of indigenous people saying no. That was in the Wet’suwet’en uprising in British Columbia. They had simply said no to a project, and it resulted in what we are again seeing today: immense violence, such as police officers with chainsaws ripping down doors. There is no reason for this violence in our country. The days of burning indigenous people off their lands are over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712843">It is time now to respect indigenous people for our perspectives, our knowledge and our ways of being, not simply for having to play defence for the Liberals or the Conservatives any time they bring up an issue concerning indigenous people for their own partisan benefit. That is the only time we debate these issues in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712844">I am asking my colleagues to rise to the occasion, to rise to the true dignity that Murray Sinclair called us to, and there are those who have already invoked his name. He called us to reconciliation because, without it, we will have resistance. Those words live on in my head and in the minds and hearts of indigenous people right across this country. They demand better. They demand reform and demand that these issues be taken more seriously and be given more credence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712845">I want to make a final comment in the last point I will make today, which is on indigenous procurement. I understand that there have been numerous discussions related to who is indigenous and who is not indigenous. This is a serious issue that has touched the hearts and minds of Canadians and those across North America. It is in the media, in academia and in this place. There has never been a time more important than today to work with indigenous people, to understand indigenous people and put indigenous people in the leadership role in developing a framework that would see indigenous identity truly respected and taken care of. I call on the government to immediately audit the existing list of businesses, strike down any that are ineligible and create a framework with indigenous people that gets to the bottom of this and ends Britannianism in procurement across Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712852">Not only is the government not providing the right infrastructure, but there are also negative effects from resource extraction, for example. I am thinking of a study carried out by the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, which showed the extremely negative impacts that resource extraction sites have in western Canada. They have consequences for nearby indigenous communities. This is an example of a bad project that does not put economic power back in the hands of indigenous people.

I am talking about the nuclear exploitation that took place in Ontario of indigenous people. I am talking about all kinds of exploitation that Indigenous people often suffer by way of this economic demand by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712855"> It is true that indigenous women in particular are facing disproportionate levels of violence at resource extraction zones. The member was on the committee responsible for the study I am mentioning. There was testimony in there regarding an indigenous woman who had to resign from being chief because of the amount of terrible things that were being told to her and around her, and the issues that were pertaining to indigenous women and their ability to survive in that resource sector area.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712871">Indigenous people have deeply committed to the defence of this country through the Canadian Armed Forces. We can remember them and their deep contributions in World War II or World War I, but they also contribute today, insisting that the very important work of protecting the Arctic should be indigenous led. Inuit have long protected the northern part of the Arctic. We must continue in that great tradition and support them as they continue to do that work on behalf of themselves and Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712872">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak tonight on this concurrence debate. I will be sharing my time with my neighbour in the riding and here in the House, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278224" Type="2">Sturgeon River—Parkland</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712873">This seems like everything old is new again with this debate and looking at this particular issue. We looked at this issue over six years ago in the operations committee. I know I have rarely mentioned my work in the operations committee over the nine years I have been on it here in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712874">In 2018, the OGGO committee, the mighty OGGO, put out report number 15 on indigenous procurement and the government's role and how we can help with indigenous businesses. I really encourage everyone, especially the government, to read the report. The government did a response to the report, as it is required to, which, of course, was full of nothings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712875">A couple of years later, in probably 2020 or 2021, I asked the government to table an analysis line by line of the recommendations, to see how many had been achieved. On the 35 recommendations, the government came back with 35 examples of basic word salad, which means it basically has not done anything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712876">I have to ask again why we are studying this issue. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> gave us a shot at the end, and I am perfectly fine with that. We did work together on public accounts, and I know he is passionate about this and we share a lot of similar values. The government should be following its rules and there should be accountability for government for its actions. We continue to see nothing on this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712877">From the report, I am going to go over some of the titles. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> asked why we have not done anything in the past 20 years. I have to say that we have a blueprint on how to succeed in this issue, and the government sat on it for six and a half years. Here are some of the headings from the report, just so the government can understand some of the things we are talking about. It talks about governance and interpretation of the indigenous strategy, promoting the indigenous strategy and preventing corporate fronts. Of course, we talked about that a lot in the question period today. Perhaps the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> would like to weigh in on this issue, or perhaps read the report himself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712878">There are other sections on supporting small and medium-sized indigenous women-owned indigenous businesses, and set-asides and the establishment of targets and goals, which makes me kind of confused. Why does the government need goals and targets? We have set rules on indigenous set-asides, on business that has to be set aside for indigenous-owned companies. Why we call it a goal when it is firm in writing is beyond me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712879">Another section is on partnerships and joint ventures, which again is a topic often discussed today, and on the front page of the National Post, about basically fake indigenous companies being set up, or shell companies. Another is lessons from the oil and gas sector. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> weighed in on that as well, and I am going to respectfully disagree. We heard indigenous business communities all say that across the country, the energy sector in Alberta is promoting and using indigenous businesses the most. The ones doing the worst job were PSPC and INAC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712880">There was a section on the evaluation of the indigenous strategy and data. This is funny because the government at the time, when asked how it was recording which indigenous companies were getting business and recording successes, commented that it was being tracked by Excel spreadsheet and that it did not have proper numbers. A couple years later we asked the same question and were told it was being tracked on an Excel spreadsheet. Thank God it was not using Lotus 1-2-3, because I am sure the government would, if it could get away with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712881">Another section of the report was on large-scale procurement projects, and my favourite one, parliamentary precinct. I want to read part of the report on parliamentary precinct, which reads, “[The government] informed the committee that in fall 2017, PSPC posted a tendering process for project managers for a portion of the rehabilitation of the parliamentary precinct for only three weeks.” For all three of those watching at home, I am referring to the rebuilding of Centre Block, which is about a $10-billion project.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712882">The government put out an RFP that was only valid for about three weeks. The report continues, “Moreover, he highlighted that one of the requirements in that tendering process was that eligible companies had to acquire their resources from within a 50-kilometre radius of Ottawa.” That excluded Métis and indigenous businesses that were just outside of that 50-kilometre limit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712883">The Liberals, who spend so much time patting themselves on their backs and are almost throwing their arms out from patting themselves on the back so hard, rise repeatedly in the House to say that there is no relationship more important than theirs with the first nations. However, for the symbol of our democracy, Centre Block, the very building that defines freedom and democracy in Canada, they purposely excluded Métis and other indigenous businesses from being able to bid or even being subcontractors on this project. It is mind-boggling and shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712884">We also spoke in committee about the use of aboriginal criteria and that the government should be having their suppliers track subcontractors so we can see if there are community benefits for first nations. Just in the last couple of weeks, we have been studying indigenous procurement, again, at the operations committee. We were told that we are not tracking subcontractors. Why are we not doing this simple process to see if the community benefits are flowing through? The government seems more interested in finding a company that is 51% indigenous-owned, which may be fraudulent or deliver no benefits to the communities, to tick a box, rather than doing the real work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712885">We heard of this in the ArriveCan scandal, where we had Dalian with its partner, Coradix, which received hundreds of millions in government contracts. Coradix would create a venture with Dalian, which had self-identified as indigenous, receive hundreds of millions in contracts, and then not employ indigenous businesses. The government has known about this, which we know from the study, and it has done nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712886">From the OGGO report from 2017, we learned: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712887">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the [Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business] suggested that the federal government award points to bidders that are Progressive Aboriginal Relations...certified, which consists of an independent jury of Indigenous professionals that “evaluates companies on their relationships with [indigenous] businesses and communities in day to day operations.”</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712888">This is another ongoing issue we have heard of. We have had first nations groups come to committee and say that they should be the ones who are deciding who is indigenous, so we do not have that fraud. It should be indigenous-led to dictate who are indigenous companies, not led by PSPC, yet what do we have? We have PSPC defining it based on self-identification, so we have rampant fraud worth perhaps hundreds of millions. We are not sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712889">Part of the committee's study was on preventing corporate fronts. PSPC “explained that Indigenous status is not required for Indigenous businesses to be recognized as such since that recognition is based on self-identification.” One has to shake their head and ask why we have clearly identified rules to benefit indigenous companies and at the same time the government states that it is okay as long as people self-identify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712890">Now, of course, we have the ongoing issue of the other Randy. I am not sure, in the current issue, whether he is the other Randy, the other other Randy, or Randy's other Randy, but we have the <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>'s company, of which he is 50% co-owner, bidding as an indigenous business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712891">The government said to committee that one is not required to be indigenous to bid. They just have to state that they are indigenous. This is the crux of the issue. We have a government that is more interested in photo ops and virtue signalling than in following the rules and getting the work done. I wish I had more time to discuss this issue because it has been building up for six and a half years, but I will just say that the government should be active on this issue now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712896">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for his great work at OGGO, getting to the bottom of much of the serious procurement issue before us. One of the issues we worked together on in the public accounts committee was the issue of subcontracting. At the time, when we were investigating Dalian, a company that claimed to be indigenous for the purposes of getting government contracts, we had learned throughout the process that even he did not know the rules around the indigenous procurement strategy. He never knew them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712897">How can a government fail so much that even the person applying to the program did not have any idea, according to him, that there were misleading applications?

I think the member brought up in his own speech, and some pointed toward us, and that is fair, that people were using the indigenous community for scoring points or for gaining traction. The government needs to move past this. We have to follow the rules. We have to include the community when setting out very clear guidelines on what is considered indigenous-owned and what the community benefits are that will maximize the benefit of indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712900">We have to stop using photo ops and seeking attention, or patting ourselves on the back for all the great work we are doing when nothing is getting done.

I am very proud to come here, not only as a representative of Sturgeon River—Parkland but also as a representative of a number of indigenous communities, including the Enoch Cree Nation and the Alexander First Nation, as well as the area that was traditionally occupied by members of the Michel Band. Sadly and unfortunately, in the 1950s, the Michel Band was enfranchised under some suspicious circumstances; to this day, people are still fighting to get the recognition they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712906">My region, which is in Treaty 6 territory, has been a region of significant settlement for indigenous and Métis peoples. I am very proud not only to be a representative of Sturgeon River—Parkland but also to represent these peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712907">I am rising to speak today on the issue of indigenous procurement programs. For those of my constituents who are watching, I want to provide a bit of background on what we are talking about today. We know that, over the time period of Canada being a country, and even before, indigenous peoples were disadvantaged in many ways by policies that were carried out by the government, racism and a number of other things. I could talk about those things at length, but I am going to focus on indigenous procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712908">We know that these issues have really disenfranchised first nations, indigenous and Métis people, as well as others, from participating in the economy. The ability to participate in the economy is the ability to free oneself to really take charge of one's own life financially. When programs are set up, such as an indigenous procurement program, it is a recognition by government that marginalization has taken place. This needs to be addressed by a special program, with the hope that marginalized communities and entrepreneurs from these communities will have the opportunity to bid on government contracts. They will then be able to build their capacities to provide the services that the government is contracting for, and this will provide economic opportunity for people in their nations across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712909"> What has happened is a symptom of a government that has let its hand get off the wheel of governing and has really taken a laid-back approach to accountability and transparency. What should be a good program to increase capacity and support indigenous peoples with developing their economic capacity has been taken advantage of by unscrupulous actors who are exploiting a weakness in government. They are exploiting a lack of accountability and transparency to access these programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712910"> We are talking about potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in funds that have been misappropriated. We know that there is this recent phenomenon of pretendians. I am sure it has been a long-lasting phenomenon. Here, people who have no indigenous heritage and no status with any indigenous community claim indigenous heritage through the government's indigenous procurement program. They are trying to give themselves a leg up when seeking out government contracts. We have seen this pretendianism manifest itself in many ways, but this is a very specific example of how it can be financially beneficial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712911"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> asked if this was the ultimate grift. This is an example of grift, where we see people taking advantage of a program that is meant to empower marginalized people, and the people who are doing this are very empowered in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712912"> A case in point example is when we are talking about the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> and his business partner, Stephen Anderson. I do not think anyone in the House would argue that these are marginalized people. These are people who are at the pinnacle of political and economic power in this country. The Minister of Employment was a Rhodes Scholar. He is a very privileged person, yet he and his business partner are checking the box, claiming their indigenous heritage, in order to benefit from a government program. This program is meant to build capacity and support people in marginalized indigenous communities so that they can empower themselves, build their businesses and be successful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712913"> I pray that some day in the future, hopefully sooner rather than later, we will live in a country where there is no need for programs like this because indigenous people will be on an equal footing with all other people in terms of their success and their capacity to build their own businesses and to succeed in the marketplace. I know there are many great indigenous companies that are already succeeding. There are indigenous companies in my riding that are participating, particularly in the oil and gas sector in my province, and are succeeding massively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712914"> There was a recent agreement made under the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation, which was set up under a Conservative government in Alberta, where we saw indigenous communities such as Enoch Cree Nation in my constituency partner on a new power plant project, the Cascade power plant just outside of Edson, Alberta. This power plant was built on time, on schedule and on budget and is now providing power for the people of Alberta, including many of these first nations communities, and first nations have a tangible ownership stake in this company. That is to show just how successful indigenous people can be when these programs are built correctly and yet, under the current Liberal government, we have seen transparency and accountability really go by the wayside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712915">There have been research findings revealed by Global News and first nations universities that have uncovered fraudulent schemes where consultants are paying indigenous people to front companies so that they can apply for this program. We are seeing shell company operators who have been abusing loopholes for years while Indigenous Services Canada is just standing by. We had witnesses who came to the government operations committee who said very clearly that this is harming indigenous peoples because it is not only taking away financial economic opportunities that indigenous people should be given priority to access, but it is also undermining the very programs themselves. When people see that this fraudulent activity is taking place, it undermines the public support for these very important programs. Therefore, we need to ensure that these programs are targeted. We need to ensure that officials are doing the background checks necessary so that the people these programs have been designed to help are being helped. That is when we will see Canadians continue to firmly support these programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712916">Talking again about the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>, a colleague of mine during question period today made a very interesting point, which is that when the first indigenous justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, stood up to government corruption, she was removed from cabinet and yet, we have another Liberal minister who pretended to be indigenous to try to get government contracts when he was in the private sector and he is still standing on the front bench. It speaks volumes that we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who allows this to happen under his leadership. Leadership comes from the top down, and when people in the Liberal Party see what their Prime Minister is getting away with, I guess they just take it as an example of what they think that they will be allowed to get away with themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712917">I just want to say that I am incredibly proud to represent so many wonderful indigenous, first nations and Métis peoples in my region. I have been speaking to leaders in the community and they are absolutely furious that these programs have been exploited by bad actors in order to enrich themselves while indigenous business owners who are very deserving have been left out, either from a lack of information or a lack of funding. These funds are going to companies that do not have the right to access these funds. It is really a slap in the face to reconciliation for the government not to take action immediately to solve these issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712922"> Madam Speaker, I am sure members have heard the phrase “fake news”. What we have witnessed is fake concern from the Conservative Party on such an important issue for Canadians. Let me explain why in the form of putting forward a question for the member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712923">The member knows that the Conservative Party has had numerous days of opposition. We might be surprised, or maybe not, that it has never, ever used the issue as an opposition day motion. If I am wrong, I would like the member to tell me the day it actually did, or to say that, yes, it came close and maybe even gave some thought to talking about the issue when it has thought about opposition days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712924">Can the member give any sort of sign of hope that the Conservative Party of Canada genuinely cares about indigenous issues, outside of using what it has today, which is nothing but a political manoeuvre as part of the multi-million dollar filibuster? That is what we are witnessing, because I have never seen an opposition day on the issue. Am I wrong? Was there an opposition day from the Conservative Party on the issue of indigenous people?</ParaText>

I have raised issues numerous times on behalf of my constituents, including my indigenous constituents, related to the Enoch Cree Nation. It has made multiple attempts to access rural broadband funding, housing funding and waste-water funding from the federal government, only to be rejected every single time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712926"> In fact, the chief and council of the Enoch Cree Nation reached out in relation to a funding program that was set up by the government to clean up abandoned orphaned wells. There are a number of orphaned wells on the Enoch Cree Nation's lands. There was money left over in the fund. The nation begged the Liberal government to set aside the funds so first nations could go out, do the work and clean up the abandoned wells.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712927">What did the government do instead? It clawed back the funding, not only hurting our environment and leaving first nations communities with a bigger cleanup bill and environmental disasters on their lands but also preventing indigenous businesses from succeeding—</ParaText>

In that time period, there were dozens of indigenous nations across this country that did not have access to clean drinking water, one of the primary elements of life. The government of the time sat and did nothing about that, so I do not think we should take any lessons from the Conservatives about care and concern for indigenous communities in this country. </ParaText>

However, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> has told his MPs to stop advocating for funds for municipalities that want to obtain funds through the $4-billion housing accelerator fund.

When my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278440" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation> was speaking, there were members of the NDP standing up and holding the government to account. When I get up to speak, there are members of the NDP looking like they want to join the Liberal Party and parroting its talking points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712932"> It is so important that we focus on the debate here today. I find it kind of odd that the New Democrats claim to stand up for indigenous communities and indigenous small businesses. I know that the member from <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> was very eloquent on this. Maybe he should be speaking with his colleagues and reminding them how important it is to stand up for them so they can access the programs and ask questions that are relevant to the subject matter we are speaking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712933">The fact is that indigenous-owned businesses have been under-represented in our country and that the funding programs that were designed to increase their capacity and economic empowerment have been taken advantage of by bad actors who are using shell companies and consultants to exploit indigenous peoples to access funds and enrich themselves. It is absolutely wrong and shameful that a member of the NDP is not championing the issue each and every day in the House.</ParaText>

She is here in Ottawa today to get a long service award. I cannot tell whether she is in the House but I am very thankful for the work she has done for many, many years, helping my constituents handle their casework. I serve what is no doubt the largest constituency by population in the country, with a lot of casework. We think there are between 260,000 and 280,000 people right now in Edmonton—Wetaskiwin. I am looking forward to the boundary changes in the next election. I should mention that Sabrina's husband, Laine, is here in Ottawa. I am very thankful for him as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712960">Madam Speaker, that is one of the first comments I think I have ever heard the hon. member make that I might agree with. We agree that it seems as though the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> in question sees every government program as a personal opportunity. That is what we are talking about today. It sounds like the hon. member was making the same point I am.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712961">I was going back to the conversations I have had in year-end panels with the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, where just the two of us, sometimes three when an NDP member from Edmonton was there, talked about the situation with the federal government and the impact on Edmontonians or Albertans. The minister constantly repeated government talking points as they relate to, for example, the energy sector in Alberta. As mentioned earlier today, there are few industries more committed to indigenous involvement and meaningful indigenous contribution and benefit than the energy sector in Canada, yet the minister constantly stands in opposition in the House to the energy sector in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712962">I had the opportunity to do four constituent round tables last week, and it is unfortunate that with the scandals facing the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> today, he is not able to take part in meaningful conversations at cabinet. I believe there is a cabinet meeting tomorrow. I suspect this cabinet meeting will be more consumed with the side hustles of the minister than talking about employment, the workforce or official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712963">What my constituents are concerned about is our broken systems across the board. The government seems consumed with experimental policy on housing, immigration, public safety, energy and the environment. All of these issues were things that constituents were consumed with at the four constituent round table meetings I had over the past week. They are very concerned that their Liberal government, propped up by the NDP, is not just lost in the conversations but completely incompetent when it comes to dealing with the very real issues that Canadians are facing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712964">With the indigenous procurement strategy, the outcome was supposed to be a stimulating of economic activity that benefits indigenous people, with a 5% set-aside for indigenous businesses. Of federal contracts, 5% were supposed to go to indigenous businesses, but before this even came up, a concern was raised, which has been raised over the last little while. There are three different areas of abuse that we can point to: instances where non-indigenous companies claimed to be indigenous and came to be regarded as indigenous by the federal government; instances where the joint ventures between indigenous and non-indigenous companies, which meant the joint ventures could access set-asides, led to the work and benefits bring monopolized by non-indigenous partners; and instances where small, nominally indigenous companies received contracts and then subcontracted them to non-indigenous companies. The first of these instances is what we are dealing with right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712965">Even before this conflict, many of us, many of my constituents and, I would say, most people in Alberta believed that it was time for the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to resign. The context to the conversation we are having today is that there was an underlying conversation about indigenous procurement and, as we have talked about, this concept of “pretendians”, as they have come to be known.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8712966"> We were already having this conversation, and then it came to light over the last week that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> himself and the organization, the company that he is a part of and has been a part of, is engaged in this same activity. I believe the lobbyist that he is tied to has received $110 million in government funds, which are taxpayer funds. Let us be clear on this. We are not talking about government money. The government has no money. Individual Canadians have money taken from their paycheques, money that would otherwise be used for things such as food, housing and maybe the odd vacation, if they can afford it. Instead, this lobbyist received $110 million. Then, while the minister was a partner in the company, it received a further $8 million in government contracts. In fact, he was a director in the company. There was already a conversation happening about that, and then this new situation came to light. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712967">I will point out a couple of things that are really important in terms of the conversation. In question period today, we will notice something about the responses from the government on this particular question. No one denied that, before he was a minister or a member of Parliament, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> pretended to be indigenous and that his company applied for federal funding. Even in the answers in question period today, nobody denied that this is the case. The <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>, I believe, did an interview after question period today, and this is what she said. We should listen carefully to the wording. She said, “We addressed the fact that that business was never listed as an Indigenous business on the procurement site, and it in fact received no funding from the Government of Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712968">I would hope the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is holding his cabinet ministers to a higher standard than that. The assertion is that, before he was a minister, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> pretended to be indigenous and his company applied for funding meant for indigenous procurement. The fact that the government did not give it that funding does not change anything about the minister's conduct and the question of whether the minister meets the standard that Canadians would expect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712969">I do not think there is any doubt that most Canadians would say that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> needs to resign and that, if he does not resign, he absolutely needs to be fired by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I would bet that, if we polled Canadians on that question and let them know exactly what the circumstances are, it would be 99% in favour of the Prime Minister firing the minister. I would be surprised if it were not. That is how serious this circumstance is that we are discussing today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712970">I am curious about the questions I will be asked. The Speaker is signalling to me that there is no time for questions. I will miss the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> asking me a question today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712971">I will comment further on this. I want to point out something interesting: It seems that even the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s cabinet colleagues have questions. It was interesting again today, in the early part of question period, that in question after question, no other minister was willing to stand up and defend the minister. It is very rare to see the minister have to stand up. He did not actually respond to or answer the questions. After question period, when a reporter asked the <Affiliation DbId="300006" Type="4">procurement minister</Affiliation> clearly about the situation, he said, “It's for [him] to continue explaining the circumstances.” He named the Minister of Employment, not the other Randy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712972">Even Liberal ministers do not want to carry the water for the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. In the larger picture, his time is up. His time is almost certainly up as a minister. Even as incompetent a government as this government is, there is no way it can possibly continue having the minister serve in the capacity that he is serving in. His time as a member of Parliament will be up too, because there is no way that even the staunchest supporters in Edmonton Centre will support him. They were not going to vote for the Liberal government anyway, but they certainly are not going to vote for this member of Parliament when the time comes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712973">I will conclude by saying that we look forward to the debate this week. We hope that ministers in the government and maybe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, if he is able to make it out this week, have some responses to this. We also look forward to seeing how every member of the House votes on this motion. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8712984"> Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise today in Adjournment Proceedings to pursue a question I originally asked the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> on September 16 of this year. It relates to a very controversial project in the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8712985">My question is about Northvolt. No advance assessment was done on this project. Now, the mayors of Saint‑Basile‑le‑Grand and McMasterville have requested an environmental assessment.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8712986"> Quebec's environmental review from the BAPE does not apply because these are areas of federal jurisdiction. More than 4,000 people at the time of this question had asked through a petition for a federal environmental review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712987">In response to my question about whether there would be an environmental review of Northvolt, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> said that the Impact Assessment Agency was reviewing the request for an assessment of the project and that the review was ongoing. The minister also told me the agency would make a recommendation to the ministry in the weeks to come. That was on September 16, so quite a few weeks have come and gone since I asked the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712988">It is generally seen as an environmental, green project to ensure that Canada has more components of the renewable energy supply chain for the lithium ion battery storage of renewable energy. The difficulty here in particular is that the Northvolt site is on contaminated land, previously contaminated by the Canadian Industries Limited explosives plant. There is tremendous concern about the proximity of the Northvolt plant. It is so close to the Richelieu River that an advanced environmental assessment is needed to ensure that we know the project has adequate safety measures in place to avoid the contamination of the Richelieu River by the Northvolt plant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712989">Since that time, there have been a number of developments surrounding Northvolt. Its financial security is in doubt after the company had a downturn in its economic fortunes. In fact, the company might welcome an environmental review to keep its Canadian prospects alive while it tries to revive its financial prospects. The most recent note on the Impact Assessment Agency website is from nine days after I asked the question. On September 25, it reported that parts of the project, particularly the battery cell components of the project, could not be evaluated because construction had substantially begun and it could therefore not do a review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712990"> However, as far as I can see from tracking this issue closely, it is still the case that we do not know if the project as a whole will have a full environmental review under the federal environmental assessment law. It is really critical for the protection of key habitat and species in that area that the environmental review take place soon and that the proponent is informed early of what precautionary steps it will have to take to ensure that the environment surrounding the Northvolt plant in Saint-Basile-le-Grand, McMasterville and the Richelieu River is protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712991"> This was a great opportunity to pursue this matter tonight, as the question is an open question: Will the government have an impact review of Northvolt?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8712993">I thank my friend and colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, for her ongoing advocacy for all environmental causes in Canada. She really is a legend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712994">This past June, the Government of Canada delivered on its promise to quickly and meaningfully amend the Impact Assessment Act to respond to the Supreme Court of Canada and provide regulatory certainty for major project proponents and indigenous partners in Canada's investment climate. The Impact Assessment Act is designed to protect the environment, ensure that sustainable projects can move forward safely and instill public confidence in how the Government of Canada makes decisions concerning major resource projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712995"> I would just add that the improvements we have made are real. The old impact assessment regime under Stephen Harper really did not do anything to protect environment, but ours does. The amended Impact Assessment Act ensures that federal decision-making, namely the designation decision, the screening decision and the final decision at the end of the assessment, is focused on areas of clear federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712996"> In any exceptional circumstances, the Impact Assessment Act provides the minister of environment and climate change, under section 9, the power to “designate a physical activity that is not prescribed [in the] regulations”, if they are of the opinion that “the carrying out of that physical activity may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or direct or incidental adverse effects.” They may, in deciding whether to make it an order, consider public concerns and adverse impacts the physical activity may have on the rights of indigenous peoples of Canada, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712997">However, there are limitations on the minister's power to designate. They may not designate a project if the project has been substantially started or a federal authority has made a decision under whether or not an act of Parliament that permits the project to be carried out in whole or in part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712998">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> can confirm that he has received a designation request for the Northvolt Six projects. The request, co-signed by some 50 citizens and a few organizations, highlighted adverse effects on fish and fish habitat in the Richelieu River, as well as certain species at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8712999">On September 25, 2024, the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada responded to the request in relation to the battery cell component production and assembly plant in the crushing and sorting facility. The response noted that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s power to designate was limited, as these two components of the project have already substantially begun. However, the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada's analysis process continues for the battery recycling plant, which will inform a decision as to whether or not the project warrants a designation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8713009">That is the question I asked, that is the question I submitted for debate tonight, and it really is a reasonable question. Misleading Parliament and misleading Canadians is a serious matter. Any minister caught misleading Parliament must correct the record at the earliest opportunity, and any minister who deliberately misleads the House should resign. The minister appears to have sat on important information, withheld it from an officer of Parliament and abused the access to information system to prevent it from being released. So, my question remains: Will he resign?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713010">However, last week, something really extraordinary happened. The minister's parliamentary secretary accused the Alberta industry of using “Canada as an exhaust pipe”. I cannot imagine anything more demeaning to the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who work in the Canadian energy industry, and who supply Canadians with safe, reliable and what should be affordable energy. It dismisses the industry and the regulations with which it complies, the billions of dollars of taxes that it pays and the equalization formula, which comes into play where Alberta finances much of the rest of the country's economic development, health and other transfers. It is a matter of how this government treats this industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713011">For decades, Canadians from every part of Canada have come to Alberta in search of, and finding, good, high-paying jobs with great prospects for long, fulfilling careers that can sustain families. The workers, and these jobs, provide the energy for our country. So, it is arrogance with which this government, and particularly the member for Milton, look down their nose at the Canadian energy industry, which was palpable and on full display last week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713012">However, back to the follow-up question that is tonight's debate. The government thought it was laughable that Conservatives were demanding accountability from a government that tried to fudge its data and refused to turn over a report that undermined its core narrative on the carbon tax, and that somehow Canadians are better off—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8713014"> Madam Speaker, the member's ability to fit misleading and untrue rhetoric into a short question is remarkable. Let us stick to the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713015"> First of all, Alberta has 10% of Canada's population. I love Alberta. I have tons of friends there, and I go to Edmonton, Calgary and Canmore all the time. I absolutely love Alberta and Albertans. I also know that Canada relies heavily on Alberta for energy, and that is important to recognize and appreciate in Canada. However, it is also important to recognize that Alberta has 10% of Canada's population while the industry there is responsible for 40% of Canada's emissions. That is a big discrepancy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713016"> Let us also consider that oil and gas as a whole is worth about 5% of Canada's GDP and 31% of Canada's emissions. These are things that need to be addressed. If the Conservative Party, particularly that member, wants to ignore the fact that Canada's oil and gas sector is having an outsized impact on our emissions profile in Canada and on Canada's disproportionately high carbon footprint, then that is irresponsible and it is irrefutably biased toward only one aspect of Canada's economy. Every aspect of Canada's economy is important. That includes energy, but a government's job is not to suck up to industry. Our job is to regulate industry and ensure that it is fair, competitive and ethical. That is what we are doing with a pollution cap on the oil and gas sector. That is what the member and those members on the Conservative side are opposed to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713017">On the environment committee, we have been working on a taxonomy of sustainable finance and disclosure for all companies in Canada, but the Conservatives stand against all of that type of regulation. They do not believe that climate change is caused by the burning and production of fossil fuels. They want to turn a blind eye to all of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713018"> The Conservatives also do not listen to economists, who have repeatedly asked for Conservatives to tone down the rhetoric against carbon pricing. I point to the conclusions of a group of well-established, extremely well-educated independent economists from across Canada, called the Ecofiscal Commission. They analyzed Canada's pollution-pricing policy and concluded that it is absolutely the best way to do two things: reduce our emissions and grow a green and robust economy. They are not the only ones who know this fact. Countries around the world have been using some sort of pollution pricing to grow their green economies for decades. The World Bank confirmed that there are now 75 carbon pricing instruments in operation worldwide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713019">To listen to the opposition, one would think that the government's approach to pollution pricing is some type of isolated experiment, but it is not. It is an internationally recognized and widely adopted economic mechanism, and it actually has its roots in conservative economics. William Nordhaus, who is a Nobel Prize winner, says that Canada is getting it right regarding carbon pricing, which is the topic of his Nobel Prize. There is a whole world of support for carbon pricing out there, and if an entire commission of independent Canadian economists is not good enough for the member to understand how pollution pricing is so effective, then how about asking the leaders of 30 or 40 different countries that we trade with and that are also using different market-based instruments to lower emissions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713020">It is very clear that the Conservatives want to turn a blind eye to unlimited pollution from certain sectors, but Canadians can count on the Liberal Party to stand up for them, for their health, for lowering our emissions and for maintaining Canada's competitiveness in an increasingly decarbonizing global energy market. These are Canadians' partners in a global effort to reduce our emissions, but the Conservatives want to turn a blind eye to all of it, which is what the Stephen Harper government did. They want to get us out of the Paris Agreement and pretend we have no action to take on fighting climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8713021">One last statistic for the member is that we are 0.5% of the global population and 1.5% of global emissions. That is an outsized impact on the environment, and we need to address it.</ParaText>
