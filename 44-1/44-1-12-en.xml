              <ParaText id="6871200"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill that I had hoped would be adopted in the 42nd Parliament and again in the 43rd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871201">This bill would remove a significant barrier for members of the Canadian Armed Forces needing mental health assistance. We need to remove section 98(c), the archaic section of the National Defence Act that makes self-harm a disciplinary offence under the military code of conduct. This means that those who risk their lives for this country can end up subject to disciplinary action as a result of suffering a mental health crisis. Often this means our troops suffer in silence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871202">Canada is still losing more than one serving member each month to death by suicide. Removing self-harm as a disciplinary offence would mark a significant change in the way mental health challenges are addressed within the Canadian Armed Forces. The Liberals had a chance to fix this when they amended the military justice act in the 42nd Parliament. In the last Parliament, the defence committee studied how to improve mental health services in the Canadian Armed Forces, and I believe the government would have had all-party support to proceed at that time. Both these opportunities were lost, and as a result we continue to lose dedicated women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces to self-harm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871203">Today, I am reintroducing the bill in the hope that the House will finally listen to the families who have lost loved ones to death by suicide and come together to address this challenge by adopting this bill and taking other necessary measures to make sure we provide our troops with the mental health support they need. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871206">There was a time when I was young that when I saw a sleeping bag, I thought of times with family spent out camping. Now when I see sleeping bags, it is because there are so many people out on our streets across this country, carrying their bedding with them because they have no safe home to go back to. The reality is that the fact of owning a home has become an impossible dream, and finding a decent place to rent is getting harder and harder every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871207">Safe and affordable housing is increasingly out of reach. That is why I am tabling this bill today, an act to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights. This bill would ensure that the right to housing is firmly recognized in law. It is the difference between saying the right thing and doing the right thing. It would redefine the federal framework for housing legislation and set requirements for the <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> to ensure every regulation change is consistent with that right, because all Canadians deserve the right to have a safe and affordable home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871210">The petitioners call on this government to abandon any plans to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline. They explain that the original pipeline, the one that was purchased at $4.5 billion, is a pipeline in current use. Parenthetically, this is the one that had to be closed down due to the recent floods and has reopened. However, the petitioners are focused on the expansion, which is essentially a brand new pipeline being constructed, without permission, through indigenous territories. This pipeline, unlike the current one, would be carrying diluted bitumen. Diluted bitumen cannot be cleaned up if it should spill, and it crosses 800 waterways across British Columbia to the port in Burnaby for extended export in risky tanker traffic. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871211">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to present a petition on behalf of our important volunteer firefighters and search and rescue personnel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871212">The petitioners, in their preamble, recognize that volunteer firefighters account for 83% of Canada's total firefighting essential first responders. In addition, there are approximately 8,000 essential search and rescue volunteers, who respond to thousands of incidents every year right across this great country of ours. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871213">The tax code of Canada currently allows volunteer firefighters and search and rescue volunteers to claim a $3,000 tax credit if 200 hours of volunteer services were completed in a calendar year, but that works out to a mere $450. Therefore, the petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support legislation that would increase the tax exemption from $3,000 to $10,000 and help our essential volunteer firefighters and volunteer search and rescue people across the country with the important services they provide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871217">Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk today about farmers' markets and the importance of proactive and healthy food for families as we head into rising prices of healthy food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871218">Farmers' markets are a key tool for COVID-19 recovery, as small business incubators, domestic system and food security builders, local economy community builders and farmers' markets coupon programs are a key support for new market development and to support existing markets and their provincial associations. The farmers’ market nutrition coupon program helps create food security and resiliency by giving vulnerable people access to healthy, locally grown foods and dietary education while positively impacting the physical and mental health of participants by increasing the amount and diversity of fruits and vegetables they consume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871219">The B.C. farmers’ markets association, with 135 member markets and 4,000-plus vendors and its long-term partnership with the province of B.C., provides an excellent model for farmers’ market nutrition coupon programs, providing almost 16,000 vulnerable families, seniors and pregnant women with access to weekly coupons, and seeing 1,909,000 to local farmers. Their current program has an average coupon redemption rate of over 91%, and 79% of those participants claim the program made a long-term change in their eating habits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871220">A national matching program would assist in meeting those demands, encourage provinces without a provincial program to create one, and support provinces that have a provincial program to expand to meet demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871221">Therefore, we, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to support Motion No. 78 and initiate a national matching program for all provincial farmers' market nutrition coupon programs across Canada that would match provinces that are already contributing to their farmers' market nutrition coupon programs and encourage provinces that do not have such a program to implement one by offering matching funding.</ParaText>

Essentially, we know that these volunteers not only put their lives on the line and give their time, training and efforts to Canadians, but also allow cities and municipalities to keep their property taxes lower than if paid services were available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871227">The petitioners are calling on the government to support Bill <Document DbId="11471602" Type="4">C-201</Document>, a private member's bill that would increase the tax exemption from $3,000 to $10,000 to help our essential volunteer firefighters and volunteer search and rescue people across the country. This would allow them to keep a bit more of their hard-earned money. Right now, the current tax credit works out to a mere $450 per year that we allow these essential volunteers to keep of their own income. This would be a significant change and reward them for the important work they do when we call upon them.</ParaText>

I believe this meets the bar of Standing Order 52(6)(a), “the matter proposed for discussion must relate to a genuine emergency, calling for immediate and urgent consideration.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871234">The Public Health Agency of Canada reported an 88% increase in opioid-related deaths last year. The coroner for Yukon just last week shockingly reported that opioid overdose-related deaths now represented over 20% of all deaths investigated by the Yukon Coroner's Service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871235"> Indigenous communities have been hardest hit, with a new report, again last week, by the Chiefs of Ontario and the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network, showing a 132% increase in opioid deaths among first nations during the first year of the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871236">Just yesterday, in response to this crisis, the Toronto Board of Health voted to join the Province of British Columbia and the City of Vancouver in applying for the decriminalization of small amounts of illicit drugs as an urgent step in the right direction. Toronto Public Health has now said that it is experiencing a historic spike in suspected overdose calls over the last week, pointing to a further acceleration of the overdose crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871237">Due to this recent and unprecedented death toll from fatal and toxic overdoses that have been uncovered, it is imperative that an emergency debate be held in Parliament at its earliest convenience.</ParaText>

The Liberals ignored the plight of thousands of people for many years. Even when the American pullout was imminent, the government did not act.

              <ParaText id="6871315">Madam Speaker, the way the western alliance left Afghanistan this past summer is a betrayal of the legacy of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers of the NATO alliance who fought in the war in Afghanistan for freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Some 3,500 men and women from NATO coalition forces paid the ultimate sacrifice and died, including 158 Canadian men and women in uniform and one diplomat. They died in the cause to liberate Afghans from the clutches of the Taliban and to secure our own country from terrorist attacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871316">Forty thousand Canadians served in Afghanistan over 13 years. The western alliance's departure is also a betrayal of the thousands of brave Afghan interpreters, advisers and local experts on the ground who served alongside our troops during that war, and who were abandoned in the hasty departure last August. These brave Afghans saved countless Canadian lives. No doubt many more Canadian soldiers would have been killed in theatre had it not been for their work.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6871317">There is no doubt that the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban in 2020 on the Doha agreement set the stage for this disaster. The Doha agreement set a date for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan in May 2021. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6871318">While the Biden administration realized the difficulty of the May deadline and extended it to September, it nevertheless failed to understand the faulty assumption of basing a withdrawal on a deadline. The withdrawal should not have been based on a deadline. It should have been based on a set of conditions. By withdrawing on a deadline, the Taliban were given a clear advantage in their takeover of Afghanistan by force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871319">It is easy, in hindsight, to question the decisions made by the United States, which has the burden of leading the free world. What is not in question is the fact that as the events unfolded in the first eight months of this year, it was clear at the time that the Taliban were making ever-increasing advances for the forceful takeover of the country and that the government of Afghanistan was going to collapse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871320">It was clear in the months before the fall of Kabul on August 15 that Afghanistan was going to fall to the Taliban. It was clear to non-governmental organizations on the ground in Afghanistan, such as Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan. Members of that group met with me in April of this year to ring the alarm bells about the threats to women and girls from the Taliban, and pleaded with western governments to slow down the withdrawal from Afghanistan to prevent a catastrophe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871321">It was clear to the UN Refugee Agency in July of this year, which warned of a humanitarian catastrophe and indicated that some 270,000 Afghans had been displaced since the early part of the year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871322">It was clear from the constant stream of media reports, and it was clear from Canadian veterans who had served in the war in Afghanistan and were hearing directly from their Afghan brothers in arms. These are veterans such as Dave Morrow, an army lieutenant who served in Afghanistan. He raised the alarm bells in interviews he did with the CBC and The New York Times in June of this year before the fall of Kabul. Another veteran, Corey Shelson, also served in Afghanistan and pleaded with Ottawa in July to send Canadian Forces military aircraft into Afghanistan to evacuate our Afghan allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871323">In fact, some Canadian veterans were so frustrated by the lack of action from the government to evacuate our allies that they used their own money, their own time and their own resources to evacuate these Afghans.

              <ParaText id="6871329">The Afghan interpreters, advisers and local experts who assisted Canada, and their families, numbered in the several thousand, I have been told. Canada could have accomplished an orderly evacuation in the weeks ahead of the fall of Kabul on August 15. Canada has five Globemaster C-17s, each with a capacity of some 300 passengers. In fact, during the chaos of the fall of Kabul, one Globemaster carried 823 passengers out of the country. We could have easily evacuated some 3,000 Afghans over some 10 flights in the several weeks before the fall of Kabul, in an orderly fashion and upholding the honour of this country to our Afghan allies. Instead, the government did nothing. Despite the pleas from individuals and organizations, the government did nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871330">It did nothing on Sunday, August 15 as the city of Kabul fell to the Taliban, the last lifeline for desperate Afghans seeking to flee the country. Actually, the government did do something that day. On Sunday, August 15, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went to Rideau Hall to trigger a general election, amid the fall of Kabul and the beginning of a fourth wave of the pandemic, because he thought he could secure a majority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871331">However, even after the triggering of an election and the fall of Kabul, the government still did not do anything in the days after August 15, until, of course, it became an issue during the federal election. The government then sprang not into action but into full rhetorical flight, not for the lives of these Afghan allies but in order to save the life of the government. Rhetorical flight is all the Liberals had because, during the election and afterward until the swearing-in of the new cabinet on October 26 and, some would argue, until the government met the House on November 22, the government was in caretaker mode. During the election, Liberal ministerial staffers were on leave in order to campaign, rather than conducting the business of the nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871332">That is why I support the motion in front of us today. We need to understand how numerous warnings that came from individuals and organizations that Kabul was going to fall and that the lives of our Afghan allies were at risk went unheeded by the government. We need to understand that in order to restore the honour of this country and to ensure in the future that Canada's word is its bond.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6871358">Madam Speaker, I begin by congratulating the member for <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation> on once again being the official opposition's critic and also the critic of the Bloc Québécois and the critic of the New Democrats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871359">I begin today's discussion with two people in mind. The first is Wahida, a young Afghan girl who was nine years old when she was sponsored by the church at which I was the minister in 2001 to come with her uncle from Afghanistan. Over the last 20 years, Wahida has found a way in Canada, shared stories and allowed Canadians to continue to be part of her life in a country that has been torn and wracked by war, civil dispute and international conflict over the last many decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871360">I call her to mind, because each time we talk about Afghanistan, it is important to remember the people of Afghanistan whose aspirations, hopes and dreams have been shattered again and again. I believe every single member of this House has their best interests in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871361">Another woman who is in my mind today is Adeena Niazi. She is the executive director of the Afghan Women's Organization, an organization in Toronto that works extensively in my riding of Don Valley West, assisting refugee claimants and immigrants who come from Afghanistan and are making an important contribution to Canada every day. She reminds me, through the stories of the people she works with, of the families left behind, of the terror and real chaos in Afghanistan, and of the importance for Canada to maintain, build and create new ways of helping the people of Afghanistan. We, on this side of the House, stand firmly in support of the people of Afghanistan, yesterday, today and tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871362">Over the summer we witnessed the tremendous chaos, difficulties and desperation of Afghan people as their government fell and as the Taliban took over key aspects of safety and security, including the Kabul airport. I watched as people scrambled to try to get to Canada and to other places around the world in safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871363">There are important questions about that period of time. We acknowledge that those questions are important to be asked. We need to look at every aspect of the situation in the fall of Afghanistan, and of Kabul particularly, and the role of Canada and its allies. There are important questions I believe the opposition has every right to ask. Those questions are being asked by members of Parliament on both sides of this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871364">Whether they are about the humanitarian assistance Canada needs to provide now and in the future; the military operations, which for Canada ended some 10 years ago, but we have continued to be present in Afghanistan in humanitarian and development ways; or about the tremendous work of our public servants during a very difficult time this summer, I think we want those questions answered. It is fair for Parliament to request those answers on behalf of Canadians and have them, in a reasoned and thoughtful way, be examined by parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871365">Where we may disagree is where, when and how that should happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871366">I want to speak about the role of our standing committees. All through the motion today the Standing Orders are mentioned. We have a foreign affairs committee. That committee will be struck shortly. It is part of the standing committee structure of this House. It is charged with engaging, and it can work with other committees such as the defence committee, the citizenship and immigration committee and other committees that are implicated in this topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871367">We want to be mindful of the best use of our resources. We had a special committee on China that was an important aspect of our last Parliament. That may come back this time. We want to make sure that we are using our time effectively.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871368">People often talk about the role of a member of Parliament and how stretched we are, and some people think it is because of our operating budget. I never feel stretched because of my member's operating budget. The scarce resource that all of us have is time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871369">All of us have this scarce resource, which is how much time we are able to put into every topic, but that does not mean that the topic of Afghanistan is not critically important for every one of us. However, let us find a way to do it that makes sure we do it well, carefully, and using the resources we have as individuals and of the House, which are important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871370">We will be asking important questions. We will be asking what actually happened last July and August. We will also ask who knew what, when and where, which are important questions to ask. Also, unlike the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, I will not denigrate the public servants of this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871371">I will not denigrate the tremendous work of our mission in Afghanistan or our armed forces, who jumped in to help with our allies and colleagues from NATO partner countries. They worked carefully and quickly with commercial airlines, as well as with operatives from Public Safety, the RCMP, and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, to find ways to have special measures to help not only Canadians who were in Afghanistan, but also Afghans who were at risk, which included women, human rights defenders, advocates, lawyers and NGO partners in Afghanistan. Canadians worked with Afghan interpreters, security agents and the people who kept us safe some 10 years ago. They had worked with us right up until the former prime minister withdrew Canadian troops some 10 years ago. This left us in a very different position than we might have been in if that had not happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871372">Afghanistan is a place of conflict. It is a place that has continually had internal difficulties and external forces, and I think we should hear about that. We should listen to the stories of our partners and allies to find out what happened, when it happened and what actions were actually taken, so we could actually dispel some of the misunderstandings, and I will not say “mistruths”, being held by the official opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871373">I do not blame the Conservatives for not understanding or for not having heard what happened. They were busy on a campaign, as we were. They were busy fighting government-sponsored refugees, for instance. Now they are calling upon us to help. They were extremely busy tearing down the structures and systems that we need to have at play to make sure Afghanistan is helped by Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871374">I will be very clear. I have never been shy about criticizing my own government, which is one of the roles of a backbencher. We do that work, but in this case, I want to commend the government. I particularly want to commend the public servants who worked day and night, seven days a week, through a very difficult time as a country was folding in on itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871375">Of course, there were contingency plans. We have contingency plans for evacuation for every country, which is the way that Global Affairs Canada works. Of course, on the ground, we have a small mission in Kabul that was at the ready to work with our partners, but nobody, frankly, could have predicted the rapidity of the chaos that ensued following the American troop withdrawal. Nobody could have predicted that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871376">I think we need a committee to discuss, and I would argue the foreign affairs committee could do this, what lessons we learned. Were there mistakes made? Could we do it better? Those are absolutely fair, good and reasonable questions, because everyone in this House wants to make sure we have the ability in this country, as a trusted ally, to make a difference in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871377">During those several weeks of chaos, my office, like many members' offices, was inundated with calls from people. I represent Don Valley West, and that riding has one of the largest populations of Afghan Canadians, as well as newcomers who are not yet citizens. My office was inundated with calls from family members fearful about those who were trying to reach safety, or trying to reach them to have a conversation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871378">We want to know what systems were put in place, and I understand that. Each one of us was frustrated as a member of Parliament, and it is fair to be frustrated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871379">We also have to recognize that public servants are human beings. They are doing the best they can. The structures are in place to help them. We want to learn from them and hear what they did, without jumping to the conclusion that “nothing”, and I quote the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">opposition leader</Affiliation>, was done. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and it is simply irresponsible for an opposition leader to claim that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871380">Was enough done? Perhaps it was not. Could it have been done better? Absolutely, as everything can always be done better. It is not fair to denigrate our public servants and Canadian armed services, whether they are public safety officers, immigration officers or some of the 200 Global Affairs staff who were mobilized to help the small contingent at the mission that existed in Afghanistan at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871381">We have helped the Afghan people in the past, and we will continue to help them. It is one of the prime places we send humanitarian aid. Right now, there is no way we will be recognizing the Taliban. It is a terrorist organization in Canada, but it is nonetheless the de facto government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871382">We are finding ways to work around them, but it is still difficult. The situation on the ground is still tenuous. We have to be absolutely careful about the safety and security of Canadian personnel there, and we have to work in conjunction with our NATO allies, who continued to have forces on the ground after we left them behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871383">We will continue to build bridges, such as consular affairs. We will also be making sure that we continue to help the 1,400 people who have already been evacuated who were Canadian citizens, permanent residents of Canada or their family members. Around 1,400 have come back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871384">We still have files open. Some of them are hard to connect with. Some of them have left Afghanistan. Some of them have gone to Pakistan and other countries. We are still in conversation with them and trying to help them. We are also guaranteeing to commit to our plan to bring at least 40,000 refugees from Afghanistan into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871385">Obviously, there are millions of refugees who have already left Afghanistan and are in places outside of Afghanistan. There are also people at risk inside Afghanistan. This includes women and girls, and LGBTQI people, who are at risk. I am getting constant communications from them. We have to find ways through civil society groups and third-party countries to get them into Canada or other safe countries. We do not need to have a monopoly on goodness in this country. We need to work with other countries that share our values and want to make sure that Afghan people are safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871386">We will call upon the Taliban. We will call upon them to live up to their stated concerns about the well-being of the people of Afghanistan. We will also call them to follow the international rules-based order and the expectations of the international community in the exercise of their power. We are not going to negotiate with them. We will demand that they do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871387">Meanwhile, we are going to continue to work to make sure that we find a way to help the most vulnerable people. That is our goal. We have been in Afghanistan before. Previous governments have committed. This government continues to commit and recommit to the people of Afghanistan because, as the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> did say, we have a stake in this. We have CAF members who have given their lives for Afghanistan, and we have aid workers and veterans who have come home and who care deeply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871388">We are absolutely there, but we are not there just because of that. We are there because that is what Canada does and that is what Canadians want us to do. They want us to continue to be a beacon of light and hope in the world. We will continue to find ways to get humanitarian assistance there. We will continue to find ways to reignite our development projects. We will continue to find ways to support women and girls, and democracy and human rights in Afghanistan, in a very complicated and difficult situation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871389">As I said, I do respect the will of this House to get answers to those questions appropriately, but we will also safeguard the information that will be released by government. No reasonable or responsible government will ever put at risk military strategic plans. We will never put individuals at risk, through their names or identities, and we will never even put at risk the reputations of the people who are attempting to do their very best. They have sworn an oath to Her Majesty and to the people of Canada to publicly serve to the best of their abilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871390">We are in this together, and I do not believe anyone has ever been elected to opposition. I do not believe that. It is the reality that, after an election, some people find themselves in opposition and others find themselves in government. I have been in opposition. My hope is that the opposition will always find ways to constructively help Canada and the Canadian government make a difference and make positive contributions. Anyone can criticize. Anyone can cut down, but to build up takes more. That is what I would call upon the opposition to do today, to find a constructive and creative way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871391">I have been in contact with members in the third and fourth parties, and I believe there is a way we can do this. There is a way that we can bring this information to the foreign affairs committee to make sure we exploit, in the best sense of the word, what a standing committee is for. The Standing Orders are there to protect the rights of every member of the committee, both opposition and government sides, to further the work. We are open to a very early study on Afghanistan. We are very open to finding a way to work together on this, to be creative, to find answers and to ensure that our number one goal is not to have gotcha moments or to one up each other, but to actually create an environment where we can have a discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871392">I have been incredibly impressed with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> and her passionate and compassionate approach on humanitarian assistance. I congratulate her on her new role in foreign affairs more broadly and generally because, to me, we are involved in foreign affairs in all of our ways of ensuring that we are finding a way to make our world better. That is why we create differences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871393">No world was ever made better by dropping a bomb. It is made better by giving people hope. We give people hope by making sure they are fed, have democratic rights, and can contribute to the best of their ability to find a way to make a difference for their families and in their lives. We do not do that perfectly. No government in Canada has ever done that perfectly. We can be better, and will continue to work on it.</ParaText>

As someone who has personally sponsored a refugee family from Afghanistan, I know first-hand that it took the Liberal government four years to get that family here when they were under persecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871405">I want to correct the member, but this is not to denigrate the civil service at all. It is to hold the government to account for its failures. I went through that process and have seen it, and the Liberals continually fail. We are at 1.8 million cases in immigration backlogs. It is not the fact that the public service has failed; it is the government's failure for creating this bureaucratic mess. We have all seen images of the young women and girls who are being forcibly converted and married. What is going on is devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871406">Let me be very clear. The Conservative Party does not want to destroy the refugee class in any way. Actually, we want to make it better because of the bureaucratic backlogs the Liberal government created—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871440">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, who will give a superb speech that I will be most pleased to listen to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871441">First, I would like to highlight what I believe to be some strong points in the motion presented today by the Conservative Party. As the saying goes, we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, and the motion has some worthwhile elements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871442">I am thinking in particular of the reason why they are asking that a special committee be created. My colleague, the parliamentary secretary, mentioned that he hoped the study would be conducted by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. However, this matter touches on international relations, defence and immigration, a combination of areas that we do not see all that often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871443">In addition, one of the advantages of creating a special committee is that it frees up the schedules of the standing committees, which, as one might expect, will have a lot on their plate in the coming year and will be very busy. I am thinking in particular of the standing committees on foreign affairs and international development, national defence and citizenship and immigration. The study the motion proposes is extensive and could take several months. Tasking a standing committee with this study would likely prevent that committee from focusing on other equally important issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871444">Finally, there is a need to restore the Canadian Armed Forces' image, a significant issue that I will carry forward and address over the next year. A number of military members have taken it upon themselves to help the local interpreters they worked with in Afghanistan. They have provided private funding to set up houses to keep people safe. If nothing is done and we send the message that some individuals could be left behind, we risk undermining not only the alliances we may want to make with international partners on future missions, but also the Canadian Armed Forces' internal recruitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871445">For all these reasons, I think it is appropriate to ask the question and to study what went wrong and why allies who had worked with Canada were not evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871446">The wording of the Conservatives' motion raises the issue of calling an election in the midst of the Afghan crisis. It is very interesting and relevant, but is this really the right place to raise the issue? I am not sure. However, if we were to go down this road, I daresay it might be interesting to see how we could put limits on a government's power to unilaterally call an election without being brought down by the House. I doubt that the Liberals and Conservatives would want to discuss this in the context of the motion we are debating, but I still think it is worth raising this possibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871447">What bothers me about this motion is that the Conservatives seem to have written it more to make the government look bad than to really find immediate and future solutions. I will give an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871448">Paragraph (m)(v) of the motion calls for an enormous quantity of documents to be produced within one month of the creation of the special committee, which is likely to be voted on tomorrow. One month from now will be January 7. Between now and then, there are about seven or eight sitting days left in the House, people and staff will be on vacation, and they may still be on January 7. On that date, it would be very easy for the Conservatives to say that the government has once again disobeyed an order of the House by not producing the documents requested by the deadline. That deadline, however, is absolutely impossible to meet, so the objective will not be met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871449">Accordingly, I think that we could be a little more flexible, for example by allowing the committee to decide for itself which documents it wants to obtain and the timeline for producing them. These choices can change depending on what happens in committee and what the committee needs in order to plan or amend its decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871450">Another aspect of the motion that bothers me is the fact that it is only retroactive in scope. While the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> talked more about the need for recommendations for the future, it seems to me that it is more about picking at scabs than anything else. Just between us, I do not think that we need a special committee to see that things were botched.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871451">We have only to ask the members who had all their immigration cases put on hold this summer because of the lack of capacity to deal with Afghan refugee applications. The system was not even close to being ready; cases in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration were already moving slowly, and this just added to it. Afghan refugees do not need a special committee to tell them that things were botched. We only have to ask the 200 Afghans whose names were leaked to the media by IRCC, which put their lives at risk. They do not need a special committee to tell them that things were botched. We only have to ask the 40,000 minus 3,700 Afghans who are still there. Let us ask them if they need a special committee to tell them that things were botched.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871452">With that in mind, there is no point to creating a committee whose sole purpose is to analyze the past. It is somewhat akin to the work of a coroner who is asked to determine the cause and circumstances of a death. Their work would not be that important if it simply involved telling us why and how a person died. The coroner’s real job is to make recommendations to prevent it from happening again. That is what I would like to see from the committee that is to be set up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871453">If worst comes to worst, an amendment could be introduced to that effect. If the special committee's sole purpose is to provide feedback, it becomes less useful. I would prefer to have it look at other issues, such as what to do with the people who are still in Afghanistan. There could be millions of them, and they could starve to death in one of the worst famines in human history. How can we get international aid to these people in the immediate future?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871454">The committee might consider what kind of diplomatic ties we should have with the Taliban government. Although it is the de facto government, it is not a recognized government, since the Taliban are considered a terrorist organization. Still, we will need to figure out how to deal with them to ensure delivery of humanitarian aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871455">It is also important to look at government funding. Since the Taliban have been recognized by several countries as a terrorist organization, aid is often frozen. International donors are more fearful, so the money that the government relies on to keep running is not coming in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871456">Under the circumstances, we do not really seem to be grasping this sense of urgency and the need for action right now. Those are not secondary issues; they should be a key focus for the special committee. I think that is what the Conservatives' motion is lacking. I would not be comfortable supporting the motion as written. It is basically smoke and mirrors. Really, it is mud-slinging, and it is not constructive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871457">When I read the motion as it stands, I worry that it will not help anyone other than maybe the Conservatives. Passing this motion will not get any more Afghans out of Afghanistan. It will not get any humanitarian aid into the country. This motion will not do anything to improve diplomatic relations insofar as that is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871458">I think there is room for improvement. The Bloc, as always, wants a partner it can talk to and work with constructively. We are reaching out to our Conservative colleagues, not for their good, not for the good of the government and not for our own good, but for the good of those who need it most right now.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6871479">Madam Speaker, I will try to measure up to my very dear colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278372" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871480">Some things are important in politics, but sometimes, in the House, we lose sight of what is important. To begin with, I would like to point out two things we need to bear in mind throughout this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871481">First, throughout all our discussions, we must remember that more than one million children could die from malnutrition in Afghanistan this winter. I am not making this up; representatives of the United Nations World Food Programme have said so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871482">Second, we must remember that we have a duty of solidarity toward the Afghan people, which means we have an obligation to get results. I often tell my children that they should always finish what they start. In the case of Afghanistan, that means that we need to follow through on our commitment to keep those who worked with us on the ground during this difficult war safe. Interpreters and their families put their lives at risk at the time and are still suffering for having helped us. We must therefore do everything we can to help them and repatriate them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871483">With that in mind, we need to ask ourselves whether what we are doing is useful in the grand scheme of things. I agree that we need to identify the stumbling blocks and mistakes in the government's efforts to repatriate our Afghan allies. I also agree that we need to make sure we never again witness such chaos in a future military conflict and that we learn from this mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871484">However, I do not agree that we should embark on a mission to nose out scandals that will last until the next election. I also do not agree that we should start combing through redacted material so that we can interpret fragments of confidential information in the hope of finding a comma out of place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871485">Every member here knows that this is a complex situation, especially the Conservatives. They did not do much for our interpreters either in 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871486">Like the Conservatives, I condemn the government's inaction last August, and I would like to remind the Liberals that they called an election at a time when people were so desperate to flee the Taliban that they were clinging to moving planes. I also think that we are seeing some professional improvisation in the management of the repatriation, which is an operation that the Minister of Public Safety will undoubtedly leave off his CV. Like my Conservative colleagues, I get some incredibly tragic files in my riding office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871487">Despite all this, if the motion of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278509" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation> and leader of the official opposition is intended only to embarrass the government and not to review the events constructively, I do not see how the Bloc can support it. Unfortunately, when I read the motion, I get the feeling that the hon. member for Durham is playing politics rather than trying to resolve the issue. He is more concerned with scoring points off the Liberals than scoring points for the interpreters and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871488">I will give a few compelling examples to support my arguments, and I will explain the conditions under which I might consider supporting the motion. Since my dear colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278372" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation> already went over those conditions in detail, I may be repeating some of what she said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871489">First, in paragraph (l), the committee is being instructed to present a final report within six months of the adoption of the motion. The current motion makes it seem that the Conservatives absolutely want this to fail. Six months is great, but, under paragraph (m), the documentation has to be produced within one month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871490">I know what is going to happen: The Liberals will not be prepared to answer our questions and will be filibustering. That is how things will go at every meeting. The Conservatives are well aware of this, since there is a measure in paragraph (n) of the motion to prevent the Liberals from filibustering. However, there will be four hours of discussion before the mandatory vote and that means that, for four hours, members will be able to filibuster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871491">The Conservatives know that the Liberal Party will never waive its parliamentary privilege. This says a lot about both parties, but it says even more about the motion, which seems virtuous at first glance, but appears to be intended solely to embarrass the Liberals. In fact, the strategy is to trip up the Liberals, not to conduct a real review of their management of the crisis, which, incidentally, is still ongoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871492">To get back to the timetable, the period during which the process would start also poses a problem. First, the Conservatives know that the holidays are approaching, that Parliament is going to wind down, that parliamentary and government public servants will not be available and that all this will undermine the redaction provided for in paragraph (n). This single step will take months, or it will monopolize every staff member in the departments involved. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871493">Second, getting back to what I was saying about the crisis, the public servants they want to call to testify or monopolize for redactions are currently trying to repatriate the Afghans in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871494">If someone in the House wants to tell me that there are currently no delays at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, either they do not work on immigration files, or they are Liberal. The department has been struggling with staggering and inhumane delays for years now, and the situation has only gotten worse since August, because it is working almost full time on repatriation cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871495">I said earlier that we need to keep two things in mind throughout the debate, namely that children will die if things do not change, and that we have a duty toward our allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871496">Will putting more pressure on our public servants improve the situation? No. Will politicizing the crisis right now improve the situation? No. Do the Conservatives want to create a committee to further their partisan interests rather than help the Afghans? That is a fair question. Moreover, it is entirely reasonable to ask why the Conservatives want to create a committee on Afghanistan, but do not want to extend the mandate of the special committee on Canada-China relations. We still do not understand why that is, but it is obvious that the Conservatives see special committees as an essentially political tool.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871497">Would it not be more appropriate to examine the actions Canada could take?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871498">Let us change the motion together now, to ensure that the main purpose of the review shifts from the past to the present and the immediate future, with a view to providing humanitarian aid and evacuating vulnerable Afghans. The Bloc Québécois has a lot of ideas, and that is why we are here. We want to work together with every party in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871499">Let us look at the humanitarian situation and the assistance Canada should be providing, given that millions of Afghans risk dying of hunger in the coming months. This is one of the worst humanitarian crises on the planet. That is what we need to do to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871500">Let us consider diplomatic ties, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278372" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation> mentioned. Should Canada forge diplomatic ties with the Taliban government? Yes. How can the government communicate with the Taliban if it does not recognize them? We can look at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871501">We can also look closely at the government’s goals. I am the immigration critic for the Bloc Québécois. The government promised to take in 20,000 Afghan refugees, and then 40,000. So far, we have taken in 4,000 out of those 40,000. That raises questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871502">Yes, we agree with the idea of a special committee, but let us change the wording of the motion so that its purpose is not necessarily political and partisan but aligns with the real objective that such a committee would have, namely to help those people who are stuck in Afghanistan. Right now, in Afghanistan, parents are selling their daughters for food, and people are hiding in safe houses to avoid being killed. It is that simple, and it is tragic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871503">What do we do with these people? These are all questions that do not appear anywhere in the Conservative motion. We talk a lot about immigration, but this is also a matter of international co-operation and human rights. What do we do about the NGOs, which are reluctant to help the Afghan people because the current Taliban government is considered a terrorist organization? What do we do with the information circulating about human trafficking to meet the needs for food as I just mentioned?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871504">Let us not forget the elephant in the room, the veterans’ groups that are financing safe houses to protect Afghans and their families with what little they have, without any help from the federal government. We have all seen their requests for help in our riding offices. What is the government doing about those issues?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871505">I am repeating myself, but that is okay. Let us not forget that one million children in Afghanistan could die of starvation. Let us not forget that we have a duty to the Afghan people, a duty to fulfill our commitment to their security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871506">Let us find a way to do that and focus on what really matters for our allies. Let us study the situation in Afghanistan. Let us make it our first order of business to evaluate the humanitarian aid that Canada should be providing to bring relief to the Afghan people. Let us be smart and realistic in how we proceed. If a special committee is formed, let us give its members and the officials who will be assigned to support them the flexibility and time they need to do their job, given the scope of work involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871507">Above all, let us ask ourselves why we were elected. Let us take responsibility and work together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871526">That is what special committees are for. A special committee is necessary in the case of a situation like the one in Afghanistan. People from these organizations will be able to testify and tell us what they need. We will then be able to act quickly.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6871527">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871528">This is my very first speech, so I hope you will humour me, Mr. Speaker, as I thank my constituents for once again allowing me the great privilege of standing in this place to represent them. I will tell members a bit about Edmonton Strathcona before I undertake my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871529">Edmonton Strathcona is an incredible, amazing community. We are a community of artists and musicians; a community of small business owners, teachers, professors, students and workers. We have incredible events like the Fringe; the Folk Music Festival; the Strathearn Art Walk; and the Canoë Volant, which is an opportunity to ride a canoe down a ski hill. We have the French district with Campus Saint-Jean and La Cité Francophone, the University of Alberta. Being able to represent Edmonton Strathcona really is the deepest honour of my life, and I want to thank everyone who elected me. I want to thank the volunteers who helped me to come back to this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871530"> I want to finish by thanking my husband and my children. We all stand in this place. We work long hours. We know that often our private life is sacrificed because of the work that we do for the public good. My husband Duncan and my two beautiful children inspire me. I am so grateful for their love and support. I thank them so much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871531">Today, I rise to speak to the opposition motion calling for a special committee to examine and review the events related to the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August of this year. My overarching message that I want to give to every single person in this House is one of urgency. Every parliamentarian in this House needs to understand that what we are dealing with in Afghanistan, what we are seeing in Afghanistan right now, is not one crisis and not two crises; it is three crises that are happening at the same time and they will require urgent action from the Canadian government and from governments around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871532">I come from a background of international development. I have spent over 25 years working in international development and sustainable development around the world. I have worked with people who have led the way working in Afghanistan to raise women and girls in Afghanistan. I am so proud of the work that our sector, the Canadian CSOs, have done, including Janice Eisenhauer and Lauryn Oates from Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan. We have seen incredible work out of Islamic Relief Canada, Care Canada and World Vision. These organizations have been working on the ground for so long to support the Afghan people. I am so proud that I have been able to support them in my role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871533">I have to say how devastating it was in August to watch what was happening on the ground, to watch the despair and the pain in Afghanistan. The thing that I felt most shocked about was that we knew this was coming. The runway for this was very long. For years, New Democrats have been calling on Conservative and Liberal governments to do more, to act faster, to invest more in the Afghan people. For years, members of the religious minorities in Afghanistan have been saying that they are at risk, that their very lives are at risk and that if they are not supported to flee Afghanistan, they would die.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871534">Even just in February 2021, I wrote to the minister and explained that we were watching the failure of a peace process and we were watching women be silenced in Afghanistan. That is exactly what happened. We wrote to the minister and said that when the U.S. left Afghanistan, as we knew it would because the Americans had told us they would, what would happen would be chaos. It was chaos. We saw this coming. We knew it was going to happen and then when it happened, instead of being ready, instead of having a plan, instead of doing the work we needed to do, we left those people behind.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871535">We should be ashamed of ourselves. The government should be ashamed of itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871536">We also know that we need to think of a way forward. We cannot turn the clock back on the failures of the government. We cannot go back in time, so have to look at going forward. We have to look at what to do about these three crises right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871537">First, there is the humanitarian crisis; 23 million Afghans, more than half of the population, are at risk of starvation this winter. The situation in Afghanistan is dire, with the economy on the verge of collapse, food shortages and a crumbling health care system. The latest United Nations' humanitarian response flash appeal is currently deeply underfunded, with only 20% of the required assistance committed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871538">The Government of Canada simply has to do more to help the people of Afghanistan, who are facing these food crises. We must commit to more humanitarian aid and we must work with the multilateral and civil society organizations to ensure that the aid can get to those Afghans who need it the most. This is complicated. This will be very difficult to do, but we have to do this work. We know that antiterrorism legislation makes it extremely hard for CSOs and multilateral organizations to work in Afghanistan, but the government needs to be clear. It needs to make very clear declarations on what CSOs can do, how they can do it and how they will be protected to do the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871539">The government will have to look at opportunities to get health care to Afghans. While we do not, in any way, want to recognize any legitimacy of the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan, we may need to find ways to get health care, food and essential services to those in Afghanistan who need the help the most. We need a clear plan. We need the government to take leadership. We need the government to meet with CSOs and folks who are on the ground who know the situation, who can get us through and get the help to those people in Afghanistan right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871540">The second crisis is immigration. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> will be speaking about the immigration crisis, but the government keeps promising things, like 40,000 refugees will be coming to Canada, knowing very well that it has no ability to do that right now. What the Liberals are not telling Canadians is that the majority of those refugees are not coming from Afghanistan. We are asking people in a country with a collapsing economy to get out of Afghanistan before they can come to Canada. We can do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871541">Finally, the third crisis is the international development crisis. This is not something I will just put on the current government. This belongs on the governments of Stephen Harper as well as the governments of the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Our failure to invest in the people of Afghanistan and to stay with them is something we have seen in our international development file for a very long time. We are at the lowest level we have ever been in the history of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871542"> Over the last 10 years, we have failed to invest in people or in international development. What we see is a country like Afghanistan, where the people are unable to survive without support, and our failure to protect them over years has caused this. Our failure to invest in them and work with our allies has caused this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871543">Therefore, I call on the government to recognize that we have a humanitarian crisis, an immigration and refugee crisis and an international development crisis unfolding in Afghanistan right now. Could we all please work together to find solutions to these three crises to protect the people of Afghanistan?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871546">Mr. Speaker, while I do think there is value in using our standing committees for many aspects of what is happening in Afghanistan right now, this committee is important because of the scale and scope of the challenges we see in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871547">I also want to point out that the foreign affairs committee, prior to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> calling an election in the summer, was not working terribly well. There were multiple instances where filibustering was happening within the committee and other instances where the committee was not working well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871548">Finally, there are many other things that this foreign affairs committee needs to look at, including vaccine equity, which is a personal favourite of mine on which we need to do much more.</ParaText>

She will recall that her predecessor, Linda Duncan, has been a friend of mine since around 1983 when there were not that many environmental lawyers across Canada. She is a worthy successor to the role Linda played in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871551">I am very taken with the member's comments. I am also in touch with many organizations that work to try to help Afghan women particularly. I am very concerned about the multiple failures, and I agree with the hon. member that it is not just one federal government but successive governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871552">In the current circumstance, what does the member think the benefit is of a committee that reports in six months as opposed to a focused effort of this place, in a non-partisan fashion, to get aid and support to the people of Afghanistan who will remain there in a humanitarian crisis, as well as to ramp up the acceptance of Afghan refugees to Canada?</ParaText>

Both of those things can happen at the same time and, in fact, it is imperative that both of them do happen at the same time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871557">Mr. Speaker, given this is my first full speech in the House, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people of Vancouver East for sending me back here, to bring their voices to the House of Commons. I often look at this place as this place of the people and it is absolutely essential for us to do our jobs and bring our constituents' voices here, represent their needs and drive change. What I have done throughout my entire political life is to really stand by the community and fight for change that matters in their everyday experiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871558">I also want to take a moment to thank the campaign team members. Without them, I would not be here. I often say that I am not here because of me; I am here because of the amazing people who work with me, support me and lift me up to do this work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871559">Finally, I come to this place always with these words in mind from the late lieutenant-governor David Lam. He said to me many years ago that it was not the title that brought one honour but rather what one did to honour the title. These are the words I live by every day in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871560">I requested an emergency debate on Afghanistan on the second day the House resumed after the election. It was my first opportunity to raise the issue, and I was so disappointed the Speaker ruled against it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871561">Now we have this motion before us, and the Afghanistan issue is absolutely a crisis to which Canada needs to put its mind. The situation in Afghanistan is heartbreaking and it did not have to be this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871562">For decades, after risking their lives to help the Canadian Armed Forces, many Afghan interpreters, other collaborators and their extended families were left in the highly precarious situation, being targeted by the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871563">I was astounded, to be honest, when the former minister of immigration's, now the <Affiliation DbId="278921" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, initial response to help them get to safety was that they could use the existing immigration measures. That was his suggestion. This delay in action prolonged the threats and further endangered lives. Let us be honest about that and let us own that reality. Canada owes them a debt of gratitude and every effort must be made to bring them to safety swiftly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871564">With the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, Canadian Afghan families are absolutely desperate to bring their loved ones here. I do not believe a day goes by where I do not receive a message from a family member across the country, or even outside of Canada, asking for help. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871565">In fact, as recently as just this week, I received a message from an Afghan interpreter who received support from the United States and landed there, but whose family members were left behind. Afghan interpreters also helped the Canadian military. Now, even with the government's new Afghan measure it recently announced, they are precluded from being able to bring their family members here because they have to be in Canada in order to exercise that measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871566">There is something really wrong with our approach to this entire situation. Time and again, the Canadian government, the Liberal government, has shown that it is not there for the people who helped us when we needed them the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871567">According to the government’s own website, “Canada and its allies have received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan citizens with travel authorization from other countries will be allowed to leave Afghanistan.” Canada must not squander this small window of opportunity given the dire situation in Afghanistan. The NDP is therefore calling on the government to bring in an emergency immigration measure of utilizing temporary residence permits to help Afghans get to safety. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871568">There is no question that the granting of TRPs should be made with temporary travel documents to all Afghans and their extended family members who have supported the Canadian military, to those who are advocates, fighting for human rights, and to women and girls in particular, who are in such dangerous situations. I know of judges and lawyers who have also been left behind. They are asking for help and urging the Canadian government to come to the forefront.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871569">I am calling on the government to expand the same support to human rights activists in Afghanistan and Afghans with family members in Canada, especially those with family reunification applications still awaiting processing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871570"> I have a constituent who fled Afghanistan and came to Canada as a refugee three years ago. The minute he was able to, he submitted a family reunification application to bring his wife and his children here to Canada. They have been waiting for three years, and it still has not been processed. Now this has happened. Every time I talk to him he is literally weeping, because he is so worried about his wife and his daughter. Why? It is because they are women in that country, where they cannot be alone. They cannot even go out to get groceries on their own. How do members think families like that feel, who are struggling with this problem? Special immigration measures need to recognize that women and girls need help. They cannot travel without a man accompanying them in Afghanistan right now. That is their reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871571">The government needs to work with advocacy groups in Canada to identify people in Afghanistan and provide them with a TRP and travel documents so that they can get to a third country. I would say that Canada also needs to recognize that under the current environment, Afghans are inhibited from obtaining the necessary travel documents, including a valid visa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871572"> It is essential that the Government of Canada waive the requirements for documentation at this time and immediately provide them with a TRP and the necessary travel documents. Once they are in safety here in Canada, we can then work to get the necessary paperwork in order, including family sponsorship applications or private refugee sponsorship opportunities. For all of that to work and for the government to promise that 40,000 refugees will be able to come to Canada from Afghanistan, we must also waive the refugee determination requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871573"> Currently, in Turkestan, where many Afghans have fled, there is no system in place for processing Afghans who recently fled from Afghanistan, and refugee determinations are required to qualify under all of Canada’s refugee streams. The government must recognize that and rectify it. It is not something unheard of, by the way. It was done for the Syrian refugee initiative in 2015. If we could do that for refugees from Syria, we can do the same for refugees from Afghanistan. I am asking that we undertake those measures as we undertook them for the Syrian refugee initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871574">Canadians are deeply compassionate and more than willing to help those in need. Mr. Dan On is a successful entrepreneur in Vancouver. Some members may have seen the products he has on his shelves: the Dan-D Pak and all kinds of products and yummy things. He was a refugee from Vietnam. He came to Canada with literally the shirt on his back and was able to rebuild his life and become a successful entrepreneur. People from Vietnam are a model of how successful refugees can be. He has undertaken to fundraise, to support Afghan refugees all on his own and not ask for anything in return. He understands what it is like to have travelled that journey, and he wants to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871575"> I urge the government to take action. We can do it at committee; we can do it outside of committee; we can do it anywhere if we have the political will to make that difference. Let us save lives.</ParaText>

Would she not agree that one of the best ways we could deal with that specifically is to not only discuss it in the foreign affairs committee, but also take it to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, where many members have a very active interest in the refugee file and could possibly have a lot to contribute to the debate in terms of how to be of help to Afghanistan?

              <ParaText id="6871586">Mr. Speaker, I have to say that action from the Canadian government to support people and get them to safety is absolutely essential and urgent. It is not premature. In fact I would argue that it is late in the day for us to get going on this. This should have been done before the election. It should have been done even with the prior administration. The Conservatives created a program from 2009 to 2011, which required at least 12 months of service starting in 2007 for Afghans to qualify to get to safety, even though we knew the Canadian military faced some of the heaviest fighting between 2006 and 2007. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871590">Mr. Speaker, it is with a sense of duty and honour that I stand here today in the House to support this motion to set up a committee to review Canada's actions during the evacuation of Canadian personnel and civilians and our Afghan friends and allies from Kabul; those who got out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871591">As a former associate minister of national defence, I want to say that my heart goes out to those 40,000 Canadians and their families who served in Afghanistan, and to our ill, our injured and, most importantly, our fallen. They made the ultimate sacrifice for Canadians so that among other victories, little girls could go to school in peace in Afghanistan and not fear having acid thrown in their faces or being married off at the age of nine. Have we forgotten the attempted murder of Malala by the Taliban in Pakistan, when she spoke up for the education of girls? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871592">Like Canadians who served during the Afghan mission, the Afghan war, I want to say how profoundly saddened I was to watch Canada strike her colours and run from Kabul, leaving many Afghan friends and allies behind, along with their families, for the Taliban to decide their fate. The victors of Vimy, the Hundred Days, D-Day and Kapyong, had they been able, would have cried out in rightful indignation at the scenes at the airport and at Canada's final retreat. For me and many friends and colleagues, it was a week of feeling frustrated, weak and sickened by the government's half-hearted approach, which can be summed up by “last in and first out”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871593">To be clear, I have nothing but praise for the professionalism of the Canadian embassy staff and our Canadian Armed Forces personnel, particularly our special forces, who were left to hold the bag for the Liberal government. I only wish they would get the love and support they need from the government in terms of modern equipment, but that is not the Liberal way. It apparently is not the Liberal government's way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871594">As a former minister, I get to see how decisions are made behind closed doors; I have an idea of the “battle rhythm” of a crisis and the response to it. Canada's response has been slow, overly bureaucratic, risk averse and without any real political leadership to get things done. We could see the dithering at the highest levels of the Liberal government, because we were in the lead-up to an election and then into an election that the Liberals thought they had in the bag. To put it simply, the government shamefully had its eyes on a majority government at a pivotal time and could not have cared less about the national interest or the human tragedy unfolding thousands of kilometres away in Afghanistan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871595">Canadians have the right to know what the government did in the run-up to the fall of Kabul and what it did afterward. The peace treaty with the Taliban was signed on February 29, 2020, and later, on April 14, 2021, the Biden administration announced its intention to withdraw from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871596">I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278426" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871597"> If February 29 did not ring any bells in Ottawa at the Prime Minister's Office or the Privy Council Office or Global Affairs or National Defence or Citizenship and Immigration, there can be no question that alarm bells should have been ringing on April 14, with the clear end date set for September 11. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871598">What did the Liberal government do when the United States administration announced its planned withdrawal? Did it strike an interdepartmental committee of deputies? Did it lay out plans for an all-of-government response? Did it send a reconnaissance team to Kabul to look at the logistics of getting thousands of Canadians and their Afghan allies out of the country? Did it lean ahead and start evacuations of, say, our Afghan embassy staff and interpreters, likely the easiest to clear, and get them and their families out?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871599">It looks like the government was like a deer caught in the headlights and did nothing. Had there been any action, the government would no doubt have stood on soapboxes across the nation to announce the news. Instead, it chose to do nothing, and this is the point. It was a choice. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871600">The government had months to plan, marshal its resources, lean forward and carry out evacuations with the Afghan government and U.S. military still in control of the country. It did not do it. Then between May and July 2021, the Taliban started to make predictable gains on the ground in Afghanistan. As U.S. forces started to withdraw, as money dried up for pay of the Afghan army, as America withdrew the logistics consultants that kept the Afghan air force flying and the Afghan army vehicle fleets moving, the Canadian government had access to the same intelligence as our allies and could have sped up its evacuation operations then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871601">Did we reach out to the Pakistani government or the military and ask them for assistance? Knowing that the tide was turning on the ground, what did the Liberal government do to get our people, our friends and our allies out? Where was our logistics hub? Why was there not a search capacity in place to process visa applications? Almost a month after, on July 23, the government announced its so-called path to protection; path to protection, indeed. Almost as soon as the path to protection was announced, the government was running in the opposite direction and jettisoned the 72-hour application deadline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871602">Let us look at timelines. Four months after President Biden announced the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the first evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Canada. By August 10, the Taliban controlled 65% of Afghanistan and the second and third largest cities, Kandahar and Herat, had fallen. On August 13, Canadian officials announced a plan to resettle 20,000 Afghan refugees, including interpreters, activists, women leaders and members of the LGBTQ community. Two days later, Kabul fell to the Taliban and the Haqqani network. The death squads started to prowl the streets, going house to house to kill people who put their and their families' safety aside to work with Canadian diplomats, aid workers and soldiers. On August 17, two more flights got out with embassy staff and Afghan interpreters. While death squads were roaming the streets looking for our people, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he would not give the Taliban diplomatic recognition. By August 20, Canadian officials managed to stop COVID testing and waive passports for refugees. On August 26, we witnessed two bomb blasts by suicide bombers at the airport and the Liberal government, in an election morass, pulled the plug; the evacuation ended. Our ambassador had gotten out 11 days previous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871603">Would it not be interesting to see the correspondence between Privy Council, Global Affairs and National Defence? Imagine what the Prime Minister's Office was saying to people about taking no unnecessary risks. All this time, innocent Afghans who took us at our word were seen falling from the landing gear of transport aircraft in desperation to leave and find safety. All the while, the Liberal government was playing for time with the media and the electorate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871604">Liberals said that we could stay after the Americans left, that we would get them out by land, that we would evacuate them from regional partner countries like China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. It was all smoke and mirrors, all a great game to protect the Liberal Party of Canada and its interests over the national interests and, literally, human life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871605">Where are the Liberals' priorities? How many refugees did the Liberal government rescue? It was 3,600 with another 1,200 in transit. First, the target was 20,000 refugees, now it is 40,000. These are targets, not reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871606">In 2006, during conflict in Lebanon, the Conservative government, with less time and warning, evacuated 15,000 Canadian citizens from that war-torn country. It acted with leadership, alacrity and dispatch; quite a contrast to the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871607">As a former associate minister of national defence, I want to say that we simply cannot forget our allies in times of need. Words with no plan are useless and are costing lives. A special committee and its recommendations are absolutely necessary to streamline bureaucracy and show both compassion and agility. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871626">Mr. Speaker, I think it is important I begin by providing some background so that people can understand why we are debating a motion today about what happened in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871627">Let us remember that exactly 20 years ago, Canada was part of an international military coalition seeking to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. At the time, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Canada decided to join our partners from the United States, Great Britain and other countries in fighting the al-Qaeda forces that had gathered in Afghanistan and that were being harboured by the Taliban government in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871628">The coalition obviously included the United States, Great Britain and Canada. Upon their arrival, they had one main mission, a combat mission. It was the first time in years that Canada was officially at war and that our soldiers were being called upon to fight al-Qaeda Taliban terrorists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871629">Many of the troops on the ground, many Canadians, engaged in direct combat. We never really saw any figures and so, even though the information exists, we never really found out how many terrorists Canadian soldiers killed outright and wiped off the face of the earth, something I see as a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871630">It is also worth remembering that hundreds of Canadian troops lent a helping hand. Those who were fighting the enemy had an extremely difficult, complex and dangerous job, but there were also troops deployed there to help the Afghan people, girls and women in particular, to rebuild schools, and to repair drinking water sources and infrastructure that had been demolished by the Taliban, who are completely insane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871631">In the 10 years or so that Canada was directly involved, our troops on the ground devoted all their energy to fighting on the one hand and helping the Afghan people on the other. The Afghan people were under the total control of the Taliban and members of al-Qaeda, some of whom even came from other countries to settle directly in Afghanistan, where they could have land and train as terrorists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871632">Let us not forget that 158 Canadian troops lost their lives in Afghanistan. Hundreds, if not thousands, of others were injured. A very good friend of mine blew up three vehicles by driving over improvised explosive devices. He walked away with his life, which is frankly a miracle, because most of the time, once is enough to be fatal. Fortunately, my best friend survived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871633">This shows once again, in addition to the 158 men and women in uniform who died either from explosive devices or otherwise, that there are dozens and hundreds of people, like my friend, who almost died for the cause and in order to help. They were there as good Canadians who were deployed on a mission. When Canada deploys on a mission, it is to help. Fighting is one thing, but helping people is what motivates us the most. That is what we did, and Canada’s military has never wavered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871634">I was in the military at the time. I personally had to train soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan, here in Canada, and even in the U.S. The training was on counterterrorism response and how to go into villages and fight the enemy lying in ambush. I was also trained on how to go and inform a family that a soldier had been killed. I learned how to deal with the family of a soldier killed in action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871635">Canadians can be very proud of what the military has done and what Canada has done. Some 40,000 Canadian troops were deployed during those years, both the regular and reserve forces. These were moments of great pride. It was dangerous, but the troops who trained and deployed had the great honour of doing that job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871636">Canada stopped fighting in 2011 and left Afghanistan in 2014. We completed our mission. We did what we could with the resources that Canada had. It was very difficult and very demanding, even though it was a source of pride. However, it still seriously challenged the ability of the Canadian Forces to do what we did, and we stuck with it until the job was done.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871637">The United States, Great Britain and other countries stayed longer to ensure that Afghanistan stabilized and that the government could remain in place. Unfortunately, as we saw this summer, the country collapsed. Everyone left Afghanistan on August 31, 2021, and the Taliban has taken power once again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871638">What happened over there? How, after 20 years of work, did we wind up completely losing control over the situation? After all of that, how did the Taliban regain power?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871639">We need to investigate this and gather as much information as possible, but most importantly, we must look back to understand why Canada did nothing to help our allies on the ground, the Afghans who worked for us, people like Wali and Mohammed and their families. These people worked as our interpreters and cooks, putting their lives at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871640">Let us not forget that, during the 10 years that we spent there, hundreds of thousands of Afghans risked their lives to help us. As soon as an Afghan was associated with the Canadian Armed Forces, they were considered an enemy by the Taliban. These people helped us accomplish our mission, helped Canada and the allies save their country, at great risk to their own lives and those of their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871641">We knew that this was coming. Months before August 31, 2021, we knew that there was a problem and that these people's lives were being threatened. The NGOs warned Canada and the coalition countries. Everyone was warned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871642">The Americans prepared to help the people of Afghanistan who helped them, but in Canada, there was complete radio silence. We were in the middle of an election campaign. Then all of a sudden, Canada realized that we had friends there and that we had abandoned them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871643">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thought the election campaign was more important. We got the feeling that he did not care about what was happening in Afghanistan, that he did not care about those people. Perhaps that is not the case, but that is the impression that we got from what the Prime Minister and the Liberals were saying. It did not seem as though they had any consideration for the Afghans who helped Canada for so many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871644">However, warnings were issued. Everyone knew that the danger was coming and it was time to act. Of course, it is complex to intervene, but the time to act was when the Americans and the British were still over there. There is no sense in waiting until August 31, when everyone has withdrawn, and then arriving late and saying that it is complex to intervene, as the Prime Minister told me during question period. Of course it is complex, but what were the Liberals doing when it was time to act?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871645">That is why the official opposition, hopefully with the support of the other two opposition groups, will get a special committee established. The purpose is to get to the bottom of this. I agree with my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois that immediate action is needed, and I hope the government across the way is moving on this. I hope that the Liberals are moving quickly and doing everything they can to help people like Wali and their families come here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871646">We need to investigate and find out why our government did not take more effective action, to understand what was not done and why it happened, so that it does not happen again. That is why we as parliamentarians have a job to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871647">The special committee to be set up will be able to carry out the necessary investigative work to help us understand. If the government needs to be reprimanded, it will be. If there was no other possible action, we will find that out. The important thing is to get to the bottom of this, and that is why we are here today. In order to shed light on what happened, all parliamentarians have to vote in favour of this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871648">I agree with the Bloc Québécois that we must act now. However, it is up to them, on the other side of the House, to hurry up and get the Afghans whose lives are currently in danger out of their country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871659">The fact is that all the committees are already overloaded because they have to conduct their own studies on specific subjects or bills.

              <ParaText id="6871660">More recently, the Special Committee on the Economic Relationship between Canada and the United States was established. The reason we need to form special committees is that there are too many subjects to study and the existing committees do not have time. For example, if the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development were asked to do a study, it could take six months or even a year to complete.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="279316" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6871667">Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting and important discussion we are having today. Earlier I posed a question to the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, and prior to asking the question, I commented on what we share in common. The aspect both of us agree on is our appreciation and love for members of the Canadian Forces and, over and above them, service members who were engaged in what took place in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871668">The Afghanistan issue has been before the House of Commons at many different points in time over the last decade or more. In fact, it very much predates my first election to the House of Commons back in 2010. I want to approach the issue of process first and foremost as a parliamentarian and second as someone who has gone through the election and heard what the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and other members talked about regarding the election call, priorities and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871669">Back in the day there was a war taking place in Iraq, and there was a great deal of pressure on then prime minister Jean Chrétien that we be engaged. We were being criticized, from what I can remember, by the Conservatives for not committing. I believe the NDP was opposed to it. The former prime minister, back in the day, made the decision that Canada would not get directly involved, even though the Americans wanted us to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871670">We argued that we wanted to work with the United Nations and others in dealing with the issue of terrorism and the other issues that were taking place in that area of the world. The decision was made somewhere in the early 2000s, in 2001 or 2002, that Canada would have a presence with members of our forces. We should never take that lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871671">We have heard members indicate they have served. The former minister of defence is, from my perspective, a hero. I believe he has served two or three terms in Afghanistan or in that area of the world. There are a number of other members of Parliament who have served.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871672">I had the privilege of serving in the Canadian Forces, but that was in the early eighties so I was never deployed. However, on November 11, I would be walking with World War II veterans in parades, which was immediately followed by going to the legions and listening to the horror stories of World War II. The sacrifices made by members of the Canadian Forces are important to recognize, and we need to state very clearly that we will never forget and that where we can learn, we will learn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871673">At the end of the day, I believe that not one Liberal member of Parliament is saying there is nothing we can learn from what has taken place. There are already standing committees, and there is nothing that prevents standing committees from dealing with what is being proposed today by the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871674">I believe there is a bit of politics in the motion. Those who say there is no politics in it should read some of the speeches provided by the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. Members cannot tell me there is no politics within the motion, because there is. If opposition members believe it is time we put politics to the side, at least at the onset of this, I suggest they are undermining the potential value of our standing committees.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871675">They are proposing a committee that would have, I believe, 12 members. Standing committees such as foreign affairs should absolutely be dealing with it. In fact, it could even be coordinating with our other two standing committees on immigration and defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871676">More resources and more members of Parliament would all be able to contribute, if in fact what the official opposition said was true: that it is not on a political witch hunt, but is trying to get a better understanding of what has taken place. Let us see what happens in the standing committees. Depending on what takes place, there might need to be a follow-up motion of this nature. Anything before that, I would argue, is somewhat premature and possibly politically motivated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871677">This is not the first time Afghanistan has been the type of issue it is today. In 2009, when we were in a minority and the Conservatives were in government, the production of papers was always an important issue. We recognize and understand that. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="278727" Type="2">government House leader</Affiliation>, the other day, stood in this place and provided an option to deal with what was happening with the Winnipeg lab and the records that were being demanded by members of the opposition. He put something on the table that would alleviate the concerns parliamentarians had with regard to the release of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871678">When we were in official opposition and the Conservatives were in government and there was a need for documents that could potentially be of interest in terms of national security and beyond, an agreement was signed by Stephen Harper, Michael Ignatieff and the leader of the Bloc. They understood that a blanket motion, such as the motion that we have seen today, was not in our best interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871679">Let me go back. I said earlier that as a parliamentarian, I was very interested in one aspect of the motion. I will read that part. It is really interesting. When I was in opposition, there is no way I would have supported a motion of this nature. The Conservatives are saying:</ParaText>

It needs to be amended, at the very least. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871684">The Conservatives would never advocate for that for opposition members in other standing committees, because they understand the importance of a member's right to be able to say something in the standing committees.

              <ParaText id="6871687">It goes on to talk about the need for national security, so within the motion itself it is realized that there are very sensitive documents that one has to have a higher security clearance level to deal with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871688">We already have a standing committee that can deal with the issues that are being proposed. We are a part of the Five Eyes, which as of today has an all-party agreement and the security clearance to deal with this. We already have a motion on the floor from the <Affiliation DbId="278913" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>, as I pointed out, to deal with the lab and the release of documents that have security concerns through the Department of Health. There is an arbitration mechanism. There is a wonderful opportunity for all parties. It is a very apolitical mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871689">Where is the official opposition, in particular, in terms of wanting to genuinely come to the table and say, “Okay, let's work this thing through”? It can be done if the opposition has the political will to make it happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871690">Where we agree is on the need to look into these matters and to pose these questions. It is not just members of the opposition who have questions. There are many government members who have questions and they, too, want to hear answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871691">We are not trying to hide anything. That is not the intent of the government, but much like when Stephen Harper was the prime minister and another issue regarding Afghanistan was before the House, an agreement was put in place that involved the three larger parties in the House: the Liberals, Conservatives and the Bloc. What has changed, other than that the Liberals are on the government benches and the Conservatives are on the opposition benches? Does the Conservative Party have no interest now in trying to resolve this? When passing this motion, which is yet to be determined, I would hope that members of the House would take a look at what is being asked of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871692">In 2001, there was participation in some form or other from the Canadian Forces. I do not know the details of what it was. In 2002, the Canadian Forces really began to be deployed. In 2006 or 2007, the forces were deployed in a much larger number, and in 2014 the then government pulled the Canadian Forces out.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871693">In that period of time, 159 members of the Canadian Armed Forces died as a result of being engaged in Afghanistan, not to mention the injuries and the psychological issues that have followed, and not including the non-military personnel. I believe that we owe it to those people to make sure that we do this correctly and appropriately. At least at the very beginning, let us take the politics out of it. There is a need to show compassion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871694">Members have mentioned that during the election we said 20,000 refugees. In 2015, when there was a crisis in Syria, we committed to 25,000 refugees. The Conservatives seemed to indicate that we would not be able to do it: that it was just an election gimmick. We more than surpassed that, by huge numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871695">We take very seriously the commitments that we have made. We talk now about 40,000. The member makes reference to those who supported the Canadian Forces. I remember talking to the media when I was in opposition about English translators supporting our Canadian Forces, and the need to accommodate them. It was in 2013 or 2014 that we first raised the issue and challenged the government to respond to that need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871696">We do not need to be told. We understand. We know what Canadians expect of the government. We will hit our targets that the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> talk about, and the commitments coming from the Ministry of Defence. I really believe that the opportunity to provide humanitarian aid is there today. Our global diplomats have a focus on the refugee situation. I applaud those civil servants and diplomats who are going through some very difficult files seven days a week. I believe that the government is open to ideas, whether from members of the Liberal caucus or members of the opposition caucuses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871697">At the end of the day, I believe there are things we can learn from this. I am just not convinced that the motion before the House is really in our best interests. I understand why the official opposition has moved the motion, and I suspect that other opposition parties might be following suit. Maybe there could be some potential amendments. If the opposition came to the government and talked about it, maybe we could resolve this in a positive way, just like the positive resolution in 2010 that Michael Ignatieff, Stephen Harper and the leader of the Bloc signed off on. They did so because they recognized the importance of national security and the interests of Canada and of all the thousands of people who were directly affected by the release of information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871698">That is why I would have much rather preferred to see negotiations before getting to this point. My challenge to opposition members is to never give up on the negotiations. Bringing forward motions of this nature is an easy way out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871700">The member talked throughout his speech about partisanship and that whole angle, yet he spent more time talking about the official opposition and history than the actual motion at hand, which is the importance of the urgency in taking care of these Afghans who risked their lives to support Canadians. Now we are leaving them behind. He suggested the standing committees as possible solutions to this. However, in the last Parliament, particularly at the defence committee, we witnessed Liberal members filibuster non-stop, and he wonders why part of the motion is to deal with this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871701">Will the member stand up for those Afghans who helped save Canadian lives and vote for this motion, or will he not?</ParaText>

I believe most, if not all, parliamentarians recognize the valuable contributions locals in Afghanistan performed, endangering their lives in many different ways. We are all concerned. That is one of the reasons the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government have made the solid commitment of 40,000 refugees. We will hit that target, and if anyone needs to be convinced of that, one needs only to look at the commitment we made to Syrian refugees, when we more than hit the target of 25,000 we set back then. </ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="278913" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> made a recommendation on Health Canada and the lab issue, which would allow for it. Given the political desire to deal with this issue in an apolitical fashion, why not allow for negotiation to draw this to a conclusion?

I think there is a desire from all members of the House to really look at this issue in depth. We may quibble over what the best format of that is, but the Conservatives have put together a motion, and that is for us to consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871709">I wanted to ask about the specific section of the motion that makes reference to a House order, and I would invite the member to consider that this part of the motion is probably informed by the experiences the opposition had in the previous Parliament. I have heard other Liberal members make reference to the fact that time is our most precious resource. In my mind, having this part of the motion in place would save this committee time because, if there were to be any kind of obstruction or delays in this committee's attempt to gain information, at least it would have an order of the House accompanying it.</ParaText>

There is an obligation in this House to attempt to negotiate the best interests prior to bringing forward a motion of this nature. I wish that is what had happened.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871715">We would have a special meeting simply because, as it states right in the motion, under a special committee any information that would put any kind of security in jeopardy, for Canada or Afghanistan, is allowed to be redacted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871723">Mr. Speaker, this is my first time rising in this Parliament, so I would like to thank all of the wonderful people of Calgary Forest Lawn for putting their trust in me and sending me to this wonderful place to be their voice. I am thankful for all of the support from my family and everyone else who got me here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871724">I rise today in support of this important motion. The fall of Afghanistan was tragic, and the tragedy is still unfolding today. The U.S. made no secret of their troops' withdrawal. It was only a matter of time before the Taliban would advance through the country once American soldiers were out of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871725">When the U.S. made that announcement, veterans, NGOs and experts warned governments around the world that Afghan interpreters, support staff and their families were in urgent need, yet at the time that Kabul fell, Canada had no active plan to respond to the deteriorating situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871726">The government conveniently hid behind the excuse of national security while our NATO allies were launching full-scale evacuation operations to get their citizens, and Afghans who had supported them, out of the conflict zone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871727">It has been about four months since Kabul fell, and we finally saw the first plane of privately sponsored refugees come to Canada last week. After almost 120 days, the government has yet to put a plan or a timeline in place for fulfilling its promise to resettle 40,000 Afghan refugees. The government has had months to prepare, months since the U.S. began its withdrawal and months since the Taliban took over the country. To say the situation in Afghanistan is dire would be an understatement. There are increasing food shortages, little to no access to money, and travel outside the country is severely limited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871728">The Taliban is actively hunting anyone who supported NATO and Canadian forces. The regime is arresting religious minorities, including Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, Hazaras and Ahmadiyya Muslims, and charging them with blasphemy, putting their innocent lives at risk and, in some cases, resulting in death. Women's rights leaders, LGBTQ people, pro-democracy activists and anyone who dares to speak out against the Taliban are harassed, tortured and killed. Vulnerable Afghans are stranded in Afghanistan, watching their friends, family and neighbours arbitrarily arrested or summarily shot in the street. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871729">In the middle of the Taliban takeover, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> called an unnecessary and unwarranted election. He dissolved Parliament and with it, any accountability his government would have had to face. Whenever we ask the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">minister of immigration</Affiliation> what his government is going to do to address this disaster, he has said that it is complicated, that they did not have enough information and that they are working on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871730">Do members know what is hard? Hard is when a person has to hide in the country they fought for, knowing they are on a list and being hunted by a regime with historical ties to some of the most horrific terrorists in history. Hard is living in a country without money or food, unable to feed one's family, practice one's religion or speak one's mind. That is hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871731">The government had months to plan for, and now months to evacuate, those who served alongside our forces and in our embassy. Now it makes excuses and talks about a big commitment to settle 40,000 refugees in Canada. Like other Liberal promises, this one will surely be left behind, just as the government left people stranded at the airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871732">The situation has only become more urgent after the data breach at IRCC, which released hundreds of Afghan refugees' personal information. When I wrote to the privacy commissioner calling for an investigation, I knew that the government would do nothing about this. I welcome the privacy commissioner's investigation into this life-threatening data breach, and I hope changes are made by the government to prevent further leaks of sensitive data. This incident, along with the government's inaction, gives me no confidence that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or his cabinet will do anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871733"> There seems to be a lack of urgency coming from the Liberals. It is sad. Afghan refugees feel abandoned. They have been stranded in a country with a regime that is hunting them. My inbox is flooded daily with emails from Afghan interpreters and other vulnerable people desperate for help. They are pleading for someone to do anything to help them. Their calls and emails to IRCC go unanswered. They cannot even get an acknowledgement from the department on whether their case is even being processed or not. It is all well and good for the minister to state that they are in the process, but those families have been left completely in the dark, just like the tens of thousands of individuals stuck in the government's massive backlog of applicants.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6871734">It is not just those stranded in Afghanistan. This fall, I met with former Afghan interpreters who were resettled in Canada by the previous Conservative government. Now that the Taliban is back in control, they are trying to get their families out and into Canada as soon as possible. They told me stories of how their families were in more danger now than ever. However, IRCC is dragging its feet, leaving these people in the dark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871735"> When the Afghan government fell, there was no time for the public servants to destroy sensitive documents, so the Taliban now has all the information on anyone who served with the International Security Assistance Force, the Afghan military and Canadian Armed Forces. The interpreters, proud of their service in the war, had shared photos and stories on social media. The Taliban took that information too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871736"> Since the Taliban began retaking Afghanistan, they have used any information they can get their hands on to find, target, arrest, torture and kill anyone who served with us and our allies in the war. If the Taliban cannot find the interpreters or support staff, they target their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871737">The Taliban send the interpreters messages and emails threatening their families, their parents, siblings, spouses and children. When they realize that the interpreter is in Canada, they begin killing the interpreter’s family members. The government’s answer to this desperate situation is to offer to prioritize family sponsorship applications, the same applications that are in massive backlogs and that were not being processed throughout the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871738">I have personally experienced first-hand the inaction and bureaucratic disaster of the Liberal government. In 2015, I helped to sponsor an Afghan family to come to Canada. The family members are religious minorities who were persecuted by the very people who now control Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871739"> Before I continue, Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278265" Type="2">Elgin—Middlesex—London</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871740">My older brother, the late Manmeet Singh Bhullar, started an amazing initiative to bring those persecuted Sikhs and Hindus refugees over here. It took four years for the Liberal government to bring those who were heavily persecuted to Canada. This included young women and girls who were being targeted as they walked to school. They were being forced into conversion and forced marriages, and the civil government sat around for four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871741">We see the same thing today. It is all due to the bureaucratic, Liberal-made backlog that is causing so many families harm. In this case, it is costing lives. Today, 1.8 million applications are backlogged, waiting to be processed. Families are behind those backlogs. It is hurting families and costing lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871742">Let us think of the refugees who are ignored by the government and are left hoping for private sponsorship. If the private sponsorship only happens every few years during an election year, how can anyone say the government is not abandoning these refugees?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871743">I want to take this opportunity to thank all the veterans and active-duty soldiers in Canada, first for their service and second for their tireless efforts in trying to get Afghan interpreters and their families over to Canada after the Taliban took over. It is because of them, other Canadians and people around the world that Afghan refugees are getting out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871744">These brave veterans have partnered with NGOs to fill the void left by the government. That first plane of Afghan refugees who finally made it to Canada was only possible because of veterans and private citizens who took the initiative and acted. That is why we need to pass this motion to finally get to the bottom of the disaster that has unfolded in Afghanistan and to not let our soldiers’ sacrifice be in vain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871745">We need to finally act and evacuate those Afghan refugees abandoned by the government. Families of people still stuck in Afghanistan tell me that they live in constant fear, afraid every time the phone rings. They are afraid that it will be the call telling them their loved ones have been killed by the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871746">Enough is enough. We must pass this motion to hold the government to account and get to the bottom of its failures. We are a country that prides itself on being peacekeepers, defenders of democracy and a land of opportunity. Now is our opportunity to do the right thing. </ParaText>

When they did everything they could to serve our country, why were they abandoned? Our country was supposed to serve them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871754"> That is the heart of this motion. We want to strike a committee for those people. It is for the veterans and the NGOs that had to step up when their government failed to so. They want answers. The people who have been abandoned want answers. This is not about politics. I hope the NDP will join us in supporting the motion so we can get to the bottom of this.</ParaText>

We have been calling for that for six years. Sadly, the government did not act and, in many respects, it is now too late for many of those people. It is very disappointing.</ParaText>

I have been through the process of trying to resettle a family from Afghanistan through private sponsorship. Again, it was the Liberal-made backlogs and bureaucracy that stopped this from happening. We recognized this in our platform and we wanted to speed up those refugee applications. We want to put more emphasis on private sponsorship, because we have seen the government-led programs and they are even worse. The backlog is costing lives, which is why we proposed that in our election platform.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871761">This was said by Pakistan's most prominent citizen, Malala, in the House of Commons in April 2017. Anyone who was here in the 42nd Parliament was able to hear those words of Malala and see the work she was doing on human rights, especially for women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871762">This is a really important time, because yesterday we celebrated 100 years of women in Parliament. We can reflect on this and what we see today in Afghanistan. I want to reflect on some of the history of Afghanistan and how we got to this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871763"> As many members noted, after the horrific incidents that happened on September 11, 2001, Canada joined its allies to fight against the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871764">Canada contributed to the war as the Taliban and their insurgency continued to grow. Canada concluded its operations in 2011, and left Afghanistan in 2014, but it was part of the rebuilding. In Afghanistan, we lost 158 of soldiers and many others were left with psychological and physical issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871765">This is a very important conversation because we have to look at where we are today. Why were we there and what great work was done during this period of time? When the Taliban took over, we knew the horrific things that were happening to women in that country. It is really important that we have this committee. It is important to not only look at the $2.2 billion in humanitarian aid to that country, but also to look at where they are today and see how we can move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871766">As I indicated, yesterday, we celebrated 100 years of women in Parliament, but we have to reflect on what we see in Afghanistan. All elected officials of its government are males. They are not there to be the voices of women. They are there to be the voices of the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871767">I have heard many people speak about some of the tragedies. As I was doing my research and looking at all the information for this speech, I looked at the fact that in our own chamber, we have former litigators, former journalists and people who worked in public broadcasting. However, today in Afghanistan that would not be an option for a woman. The Taliban has taken that away. In the last four months, women who were fighting and continuing to be the voices of women have now been stuck in their homes and told not to come out because of security reasons. These are the same things that we heard from 1996 to 2001, when the Taliban ruled that country. Unfortunately, we are seeing the exact same thing beginning to happen today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871768">What is Canada going to do about this? We are a country that talks about human rights. We are a country that wants to see more for women. We know now that young men and boys are allowed to go to school, from grades seven to 12, but girls are not welcome. The girls are not back in those houses of education. Malala indicated, “The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871769">That is exactly what we are seeing today, a country that is going backward. We are seeing a country that has now taken all of the rights of women backward. Unfortunately, a lot of these women are trying to go forward and are trying to have their voices heard. As we have heard from many members, at what cost. A lot of times the cost is their lives and we have to be very worried about that. These are the things we should be speaking to at the committee, not just how we failed Afghanistan in August 2021 but how we can move forward to ensure there is equality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871770"> An Olympic athlete from Afghanistan would like to compete in the 2024 Olympics, but right now she is hiding in her home. She had a number of Taliban come to her home looking for her because of her postings on Facebook and other social media feeds. This young woman is now fearful for her life. These are the people for whom we should be fighting. These are some of the most vulnerable people in the world. They should be able to have this opportunity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871771"> When Afghanistan was ruined after the Taliban, Canada was part of remodelling and restructuring of Afghanistan. We were part of the education and we were part of the infrastructure. We were part of the education when it came to policing and training. This is what our role was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871772">To all of those persons, whether they are in the Canadian Armed Forces or are members of NGOs across Canada, I thank them so much for making it a better world. Unfortunately, we are at a stalling point and we know we are going backward. It is really important that we continue to move forward, though.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871773">I would like to read a quote from the Olympic athlete I was talking about. She is a paralympian athlete, who said, “Please, I request you all, especially all the women from around the globe and the female institutions and the United Nations to not let the right of a female citizen of Afghanistan in the Paralympic movement to be taken away, so easily.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871774">This is a young tae kwon do athlete. These are the things that here in Canada we strive for. With children in our own country, we try to make sure they have opportunities. We know poverty continues to get worse in Afghanistan and that the opportunities for food are not there, and there are many other things its citizens have to deal with every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871775">When the Taliban came to power, it promised to respect women and allow them to participate in public life in accordance with Islamic law, but secondary schools remain closed for girls and many women are finding returning to work difficult, with the exception of some professionals in some of the health care sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871776">We have to recognize that women's rights are not being upheld. We need to talk about what we want to see for this globe. When we are talking about wars and things that happen in these countries that are horrific, we know a lot of it has to do with equality. Unfortunately, what we are seeing in Afghanistan is the exact opposite. This is why we need to work together. This is the reality of what Afghan women are seeing, and once again, we need to be on the ground and helping these people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871777">On August 26, we were able to bring some to Canada, who were able to get to flights. We need to do more. As many members have indicated, veterans and other people watching what is happening in Afghanistan are writing emails and letters and calling our offices to ask how they can help. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871778">We know this tragedy is not going to go away if we just turn a blind eye. It is important to have this committee to talk about where we were in August, what we should have done and how we are going to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871779">This is an urgent time for all and I would like to talk about the ministry and what has happened. We see simple things like the fact that the ministry of women's affairs has been replaced. Since the Taliban has come into force, there is not a ministry of women. It has now been replaced with the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871780">Perhaps somebody can tell me what that means. It seems very forceful and not about women's equality, not about education for women and not about the opportunities for the families and the generations to come. What are we going to see next?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871781">I would like to end with a quote from the interim mayor of Kabul, who said that women municipal workers in Kabul should stay home unless they hold “positions that men could not fill or that were not for men.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871782">We have to understand that we do not want to move backward. We need to be a country that shows its principles, works with other countries and ensures we are there for Afghanistan in its time of need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871791">Mr. Speaker, in the House, I have worked extensively on international human rights issues, but nowadays, I see many stories from Canada suggesting that we are a country in need of intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871792"> One recent story that got my attention was from Timothy Que, a 16-year-old who attends Eric Hamber Secondary School in Vancouver. Timothy tried to start a Catholic club, a voluntary association of students who get together to discuss Catholic ideas, but administrators forbade him from sharing Catholic teaching at the club, even with students who chose to attend the meetings. This is a shameful violation of freedom of association, but it is one small drop in a growing sea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871793"> Religious services have faced pandemic-related restrictions that have not been applied to casinos. Government is proposing criminal charges for people who express certain personal or religious views in private conversations. The Liberal platform promised another ideological values test imposed on charities. Dozens of churches were destroyed or vandalized this summer with virtually no comment from political leaders. If these events were happening in another country, I know that Canada would not be silent. I hope more members of Parliament resist the populist pressure to clamp down on minority opinions and instead defend freedom of speech, association and religion as they are protected in our charter.</ParaText>

This park is where Jacques Cartier docked his caravel for his first winter and where he had contact with Donnacona and his community. Therefore, it is a national historic site symbolizing the dialogue between francophones and first nations. It could be an ideal place to introduce schoolchildren to the history of Quebec, but this is not possible since the park is closed during the school year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871798">In the summer, anyone who wants to learn about our history has little in the way of resources. The signs are partly illegible; the reproduction of the caravel has rotted and burned without being rebuilt; the cross that was a reproduction of Cartier's has been so neglected that Parks Canada removed it, with no intention of replacing it. The history between francophones and first nations needs to be highlighted and celebrated through better funding for Cartier-Brébeuf Park and year-round public access, because Cartier-Brébeuf Park needs to be more than just a nice, well-mowed park.</ParaText>

First elected to city council in 1975, John served as mayor from 1994 to 2013. All told, he led Kirkland from a town of about 7,500 into a populous and prosperous Montreal suburb of 21,000, doing so with an efficient decision-making style and practical common-sense approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871806">John Meaney was a proud Irish Montrealer born in the iconic downtown neighbourhood of Griffintown. In 2008, in a fitting honour, he was named Grand Marshall of Montreal's legendary St. Patrick's Day parade; and, in 2012, Montreal's Irishman of the Year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871813">Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to recognize the 100th birth anniversary of His Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj. His holiness was a Hindu swami of Swaminarayan denomination and he gifted the people of Canada the magnificent BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Toronto, which is the first traditionally hand-carved Hindu place of worship in all of Canada. The Mandir stands as a symbol of Canada's abundant diversity, cultural mosaic and freedom of religion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871814">His holiness lived by the saying “In the joy of others lies our own”. This was evident in his work, which promoted health and inspired spiritual, humanitarian, environmental and educational initiatives. BAPS charities have supported communities right across Canada, including in my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods, and provided thousands of COVID vaccines to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871815">Since his passing in 2016, his successor, His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj, continues his legacy of inspiring people around the world. Pramukh Swami Maharaj's life work is one that needs to be preserved and celebrated for the present and future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871820">On one forum, a former broadcaster commented, “After watching Abbotsford Mayor Braun's 9pm press conference on the city's YouTube channel last night, warning residents of Sumas Prairie to evacuate NOW...I thought I'd dial up the city's radio station to hear what they were doing. After painfully struggling through a 5-minute commercial cluster, they played their station ID and went back to another 10 [songs] in a row!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6871821">A disaster can wipe out land lines, cellphones, cable and the Internet, but traditionally news and alerts have always been as close as that car or truck radio. I plan to ask the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to review broadcasters’ performance in B.C., including disaster plans, staff resources and technical resiliency. With station ownership now so much in the hands of large corporations, there is no excuse for Canadians to be underserved.</ParaText>

If we do not support workers in Alberta, Canada will not be able to meet its climate obligations.</ParaText>

Alberta has the knowledge base, and we just need the federal government to invest in Albertans. This cannot wait. The government must invest in a federal jobs plan now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6871953">Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives continue to talk down Canada's strong economic recovery following the COVID-19 recession. Perhaps that is because we did a better job than they did in 2008 when they were in office. Canada has already recovered more jobs than those that were lost during the COVID-19 recession. By way of comparison, it took nearly eight months more to recover jobs after the 2008 recession.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872064">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872065">I want to point out that the House is governed by rules that we are all called upon to follow. For example, when we ask a question, we stand up. We must also abide by a certain code and listen to the answer given, if any, of course. We must always respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872066"> Since the House resumed sitting, there has been a lot of background noise, as there are more members present in the House. We recognize that. That was not the case in the last six months of the previous Parliament, from January to June, when there were only a handful of government members and a few dozen opposition members. We admit that the noise was less intrusive then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872067">We also recognize that when someone rises to answer a question and we hear some heckling, the Speaker frequently rises to call members to order, as he should. Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to be very careful about inviting members giving an answer to start over from the beginning. Inevitably, their speaking time is much longer, allowing members to repeat exactly the same argument. However, the people at home have heard the answer because the microphones picked it up, particularly when the question comes from someone who is not physically present in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872068">I therefore invite everyone to follow the Standing Orders very strictly, which state that we should not heckle and that we should listen carefully to the person speaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872069">Unfortunately, breaches can occur, because we are human. People who have things to say must be able to say them, provided that we hear them properly. If, unfortunately, there is too much noise at the start, we can stop and start again at the beginning, but not at the end.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872090">I rise this afternoon to speak about the brave members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their civilian colleagues on the ground in Kabul who helped coordinate the daring evacuation from Afghanistan this past summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872091">I want to speak about this whole-of-government mission and how we worked closely with our allies and partners to bring as many Canadian citizens, permanent residents and Afghans to safety as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872092">First, let me say how grateful I am for the brave men and women of our Canadian Armed Forces. This event was certainly one of the most difficult non-combative evacuation operations ever undertaken by Canadian Armed Forces, and their members stepped up when the world needed them to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872093">All of us gathered here today have seen the harrowing images of thousands desperate to leave, with a limited number of spaces to get people out, and the CAF members doing their best to evacuate panicked civilians as the security situation disintegrated rapidly around them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872094">We know that prior to the rapid fall of Kabul to Taliban forces, Global Affairs and IRCC were working around the clock to get Canadian citizens and those vulnerable Afghans who were approved for resettlement in Canada onto flight manifests and out of the country as fast as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872095">With the Taliban now in charge, this was no longer a straightforward process. What used to be a short drive to the airport now took about 12 hours. Streets were clogged. With the security situation getting increasingly dangerous, chaotic and desperate by the hour, Global Affairs and IRCC issued a general call for all eligible evacuees rather than a staggered approach. This was done to ensure that the greatest number of people possible made it onto flights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872096">At this point, the single-biggest challenge to the evacuation effort was getting people to the airport through all the congestion, the Taliban checkpoints and the sporadic violence. For those who made it to the airport gates, they faced intense crowding, violence, sweltering heat and the reality there was no guarantee one could actually get inside. For those who managed to make it inside, the desperate situation caused fights to break out. We heard about families getting separated from each other in the chaos. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872097">When Canadian Armed Forces evacuation aircraft arrived, they could only be on the ground for a very short window to keep the U.S.-led coalition air bridge functional. Despite all these significant challenges, CAF members still safely escorted large numbers of Canadians, permanent residents, allied citizens and vulnerable Afghans through the Kabul airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872098">In total, Canada successfully evacuated approximately 3,700 people. All of us here are extremely proud of the Canadian Armed Forces members who worked under such incredibly dangerous conditions, with support from staff at Global Affairs and IRCC. We thank them again for their courage and compassion in the face of great danger to their own lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872099">A lot of this coordination work was carried out from the Canadian embassy in Kabul. I want to recognize Global Affairs staff members for their essential work securing the facility and preparing for evacuation. We began developing our evacuation contingency plans in the spring of 2021. Next, the CAF deployed a strategic advisory team to design plans for a rapid evacuation and possible mission closure if the security situation were to deteriorate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872100">DND and the CAF had been working closely in support of government and Canadian partners for months as we carefully watched deployments on the ground, and it was those early discussions with our partners at Global Affairs that allowed us to plan well ahead of time for a number of different scenarios, including the potential extraction of personnel from the country by the Canadian Armed Forces personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872101">On July 23, the Government of Canada announced a program to resettle Afghans who had supported Canada's security and development efforts in Afghanistan. Defence team officials worked closely with Global Affairs and IRCC to explore how military personnel and assets could help support this important resettlement program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872102">By July 30, the government approved a request for assistance that began direct CAF involvement in evacuating Canadian citizens and permanent residents from the country as well Afghan nationals eligible for settlement under IRCC's special immigration measures program.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872103">The first CAF and civilian chartered flights operated by the Government of Canada began transporting evacuees out of Afghanistan by August 4. On August 15, Global Affairs decided to temporarily suspend operations at our embassy in Kabul and all personnel were evacuated. By August 26, the end of the evacuation mission, the CAF had transported approximately 3,700 persons from Kabul in very difficult conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872104">In the aftermath, our departments have continued to do everything they can to support the resettlement of at-risk Afghans. The defence team is working to identify more interpreters who supported the Canadian mission and helped IRCC bring them over. We are also confirming employment records as part of the resettlement efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872105">We supported NATO's Operation Allied Solace and its mission to airlift over 1,000 Afghan contractors and immediate family members from Kuwait and Qatar to temporary camps in Kosovo in Poland. As part of this support, the CAF deployed three members to Kosovo, themselves originally from Afghanistan, to serve as interpreters at the camp.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872106">At NATO's request, Canada had agreed to resettle up to 472 Afghan contractors subject to screening protocol. This is the highest commitment among our NATO allies and it is a commitment we gladly undertake. This pledge is part of our broader commitment to resettle 40,000 Afghans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872107">In the midst of the chaos in Kabul this summer, there were poignant reminders about why Canadians were there doing our best in a nearly impossible situation. There was an Afghan girl at the airport who was awestruck at the sight of a woman military police officer as she boarded one of our evacuation flights. She asked her dad, “How can a woman be a police officer?” Her father explained that in Canada women could be police officers. Looking up at the soldier, the little girl said that she wanted to be a police officer when she grew up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872108">There was also a little Afghan boy at the airport who was so greatly admired by one of our Canadian soldiers that he would not leave his side as the soldier carried out his work during an evacuation flight. We heard how the soldier cared for that boy who was about the same age as his own son, who was waiting for him to return safely home to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872109">These are but two of what will eventually be thousands of personal stories of Afghan evacuees beginning a new life in Canada. On behalf of the Government of Canada, we welcome them to their new home. For members of the Canadian Armed Forces and all civilians who supported the evacuation effort, Canadians thank them for a job well done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872129">Madam Speaker, I have been listening to the concerns and questions from my colleagues throughout the day on both sides of the House about how Canada and the world responded to the upheaval of the fall of Kabul. The difficulties in operating in Afghanistan cannot be underestimated, so I want to respond to the motion today by sharing information about the government's Afghanistan exit strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872130">Since the end of the air bridge evacuation in August, we have helped over 1,400 Canadians, permanent residents and their family members leave the country. As we heard the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> say earlier today, another 520 Afghan refugees are arriving here tomorrow. However, by no means have we ended our consular support in Afghanistan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872131">Today, nearly four months since the fall of Kabul, a dedicated team of Global Affairs Canada officials continue to support Canadian citizens and permanent residents in Afghanistan who want to leave. Global Affairs Canada is responsible for providing this emergency assistance to Canadians abroad under, of course, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act. This responsibility includes the repatriation or assisted departure of Canadians in distress. In the event of a crisis, Global Affairs Canada activates these tools and strategies in support of Canada's network of diplomatic missions abroad. This allows them to rapidly mobilize, situate resources where they are most needed and directly support the people affected by an emergency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872132">Global Affairs undertook significant planning and preparedness efforts in the months prior to the fall of Kabul. The department did this to ensure that Canada was ready for all possibilities. These efforts ramped up significantly in July 2021 as the security situation worsened. During this period, Global Affairs convened interdepartmental task force calls, or ITFs. These ITF calls ensure interdepartmental collaboration and common situational awareness among departments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872133">At the same time as Global Affairs was holding these ITF calls on Afghanistan, similar meetings were taking place across the government of Canada, including at the deputy minister and PCO levels. To ensure maximum situational awareness, Global Affairs also ramped up international liaison activities with like-minded countries. This enabled Canada and its international partners to share information and to work together on consular matters and repatriation efforts. Communicating with Canadian citizens and permanent residents abroad is critically important during an emergency, and we know it can be a lifeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872134">At all times during the Afghanistan crisis, Canada was in contact with citizens and permanent residents. Global Affairs proactively developed vital updates and information and shared them widely. The department did so via the registration of Canadians abroad system and through social media and other communications channels. These actions enable Canadians to take difficult decisions regarding their safety and well-being. They were an essential tool for those who chose to leave Afghanistan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872135">To manage the surge in consular requests, more than 200 Global Affairs employees joined the effort at headquarters and from missions abroad. They worked as emergency responders and emergency contact centre agents throughout August and September. More than a dozen standing rapid deployment team members were deployed to Qatar and Islamabad in support of response efforts. Officers from the Department of National Defence; Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency were embedded within the Global Affairs emergency watch and response centre to ensure the most effective response possible. Robust case management teams were established and worked long hours to provide services in support of Canadians, permanent residents and their families. An Afghanistan crisis management team continues to operate today. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6872136">Together, these dedicated public servants have done and continue to do their utmost to support the safe passage of Canadians, permanent residents and their family members. The special immigration measures programs continue to be an essential tool to help Afghan nationals who have significant and enduring Canadian connections to resettle here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872137">Prior to the evacuation in August, Global Affairs and National Defence worked closely with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to advocate for the need for a program to safeguard vulnerable Afghan nationals who may be at risk due to their work supporting Canadian efforts in Afghanistan. Both before and after the establishment of special immigration measures for Afghanistan, Global Affairs has supported IRCC in its efforts to resettle Afghan nationals here in Canada. Global Affairs support includes acting as a referral agency for incoming Afghans, as well as coordinating and facilitating safe passage with National Defence and international partners. Today, a dedicated team of Global Affairs officers continues to support those who wish to leave Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872138">The current operations have a dual focus. The first is ensuring that those who wish to leave have the documents they need in order to travel, and the second is working with international partners to identify and take advantage of departure opportunities when they become available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872139">I am proud of the work of our Global Affairs staff. Despite the closing of the air bridge and very challenging conditions on the ground, Global Affairs has helped to repatriate more than 1,400 Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families, and the work continues. That means 1,400 women, men and children will not be subject to the repressive policies of the Taliban regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872140">I am fully aware that the work is not done; it is far from done. It is important, though, that we learn from the challenges we face together, and I hope all members will agree that we cannot do so by politicizing the men, women and children we brought home. It would be completely inappropriate, of course, to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872141">I believe we can find a way to have these discussions respectfully, in the pursuit of truth. Is the forum being proposed by the opposition today the best place for that discussion? I am not sure it is, but I will certainly carefully consider the arguments being put forward today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872142">One sure thing is that operations remain under way to help Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families who wish to leave Afghanistan. Our consular services are dedicated to helping Canadians in distress, whether they are in Afghanistan or anywhere in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872156">The Taliban regime is known for its brutality, human rights violations and ruthless killings. For months now, we have been hearing from our men and women in uniform about the imminent dangers to those who fought alongside them in Afghanistan and that their lives are at risk. Thousands of Afghan refugees remain stranded in Afghanistan and surrounding countries, but the Liberal government has yet to announce the timeline or a plan for resettling all 40,000 refugees it promised to bring to Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872157">These brave individuals supported our military heroes in Afghanistan during their darkest times. The least we can do is help make sure they are safe. Despite the deteriorating situation, and the life-threatening conditions these refugees are living in, the Liberals continue to sit on their hands. In the four months that have passed since Kabul fell, the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation> has failed to deliver on the promise made by the government to Afghans fleeing the Taliban regime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872158">The inaction of the Liberals on this issue is inexcusable. NGOs, experts and veterans all warned the government months before Afghanistan fell that urgent action was needed to help Afghan interpreters, support staff and their families. The government ignored these warnings and instead called an unnecessary election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872159">The government had months to prepare for the refugee crisis in Afghanistan. It knew vulnerable Afghan refugees needed help before the U.S. withdrew its troops from Afghanistan. The Liberal-made backlogs have left refugees in the dark. Veterans and members of NGOs have had to step up and become the last hope for many Afghans stuck in limbo, a limbo created by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872160">Not only did the government fail to get Canadians, interpreters, support staff and their families out of Afghanistan as the country fell to the Taliban, it also refused to continue to fund their safe houses. Safe houses have been protecting religious minorities and women as the country faces growing economic and food crises. These brave men and women continue to be forced to hide from the Taliban. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872161">In addition to the government's complete indifference, there was a serious government data leak that exposed many Afghans who had applied for visas here in Canada. It occurred shortly after the Liberals promised to bring in 40,000 Afghans threatened with Taliban reprisals because of their previous work as rights advocates, journalists, members of the judiciary, or because they belong to religious and ethnic minorities targeted by these terrorists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872162">The recent data breach at IRCC continues to threaten the lives of several hundred vulnerable Afghans seeking refuge from the Taliban. The ramifications of this inexcusable mistake will have life-threatening consequences, and the government must take immediate action to address this unacceptable error. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872163">We heard from Canadians who are worried about their loved ones. I have met with many of them in my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods, and they continue to hear of the Taliban using phone and Internet surveillance to track down, and in some cases kill, perceived enemies and religious minorities in Afghanistan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872164">I am standing here today to ensure the government shows some accountability because further mistakes of this nature, or delays in bringing Afghan refugees to Canada, could have grave consequences for those whose help we once needed, and they desperately need our help now. Afghan interpreters, embassy staff and their families are now being hunted down by the Taliban because they put themselves in harm's way to help our country. Extremist and terrorist groups are making it difficult for refugees to escape on foot through rural Afghanistan to countries such as Pakistan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872165">Meanwhile, the Liberal government has brought to Canada less than 10% of the number of Afghan refugees that it had promised it would bring during the election. Faced with the prospect of life or death, these brave Afghans cannot afford more incompetence and red tape from the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872166">Canadians need to know that safeguards are in place to protect those who fought alongside our country in Afghanistan. We must examine what contingency plans Canada had in place for evacuations of Canadians, and we need to ensure that real efforts are being made to bring Afghan interpreters and others who helped the Canadian Armed Forces in that region to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872167">The fact that those who served alongside our men and women in uniform were left behind in Afghanistan is a stain on our country. This is why Conservatives are calling for a special committee to review and analyze the inaction of the Liberal government on this issue and make recommendations on how Canada can quickly get these Afghan interpreters, support staff and families to Canada. This committee is not just about looking back. It is also about looking forward and making an actual plan to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872168">I cannot speak about Afghanistan refugees without thinking about and acknowledging the heroic work by my dear friend and former Alberta minister Manmeet Singh Bhullar. When he heard of the plight of religious minorities in Afghanistan, such as Sikhs, Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities, he worked day and night to try to get them here to Canada as refugees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872169">Manmeet was killed in a tragic accident in 2015. His dream of bringing these religious minorities to Canada lives on through the Manmeet Singh Bhullar Foundation and organizations such as the World Sikh Organization, where hundreds of Canadians have collected funds to support applications to bring refugees here to Canada. Unfortunately, much like with the issue with interpreters, contractors, their families and those who supported Canadians, there is little progress. There is no timeline, and there is no clear plan to bring them here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872170">Religious minorities, women's rights leaders and democratic activists continue to be forced into hiding from the Taliban. They need our help. Any attempt by the government to cover up their failures in Afghanistan by using security concerns as an excuse will not be acceptable. The requested documents will be subject to a thorough process that will protect Canada and its allies from publicly releasing potentially sensitive security information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872171">Words without action or a plan are useless. As the Taliban's grasp on Afghanistan tightens, and its hunt for remaining allies continues, now is the time for action. Lives are at risk. We need real answers, followed by real action. Our friends in Afghanistan and their loved ones depend on it.</ParaText>

I stood up to speak to our standing committees. The official opposition is spearheading this through this particular motion, yet I would rather have seen a negotiation take place among the different parties to ensure that it was depoliticized, that the politics were taken out of it. I think we owe that to members of the forces and those who have been engaged in what has been taking place virtually since 2001.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6872185">Madam Speaker, on July 14, I sat on a Zoom call with a former Canadian interpreter from Helmand Province. On that call were several of my colleagues, including the hon. members for <Affiliation DbId="278158" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="278418" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation>. It was an emotional call. It was an interpreter who was pleading for his life. The Taliban were 500 metres away, and they were hunting those who had helped allied forces during the Afghanistan war. I was in my constituency office, and after that call I actually had tears streaming down my face. My staff asked me what had happened. I said I had just heard the most horrific pleas that I could ever hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872186">From that time, we saw Afghanistan descend into chaos. We all know the stories about what happened at the airport, but through it all there were Canadians and Canadian veterans. In my former role as critic for Veterans Affairs I was dealing directly with those veterans, and being supplied with hundreds of names of those whose lives were in jeopardy in Afghanistan and who had helped our Canadian Forces. I was supplying those names directly to the minister at the time. I was getting phone calls at 3 a.m. from Afghanistan. Somehow my cellphone number got out. The callers were begging for help, and all I could do was supply their names to the minister directly. I thank the minister for taking my calls and being there at a time when people needed him the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872187">There were veterans, volunteers, NGOs and individuals like Zarmina and Khalil Nekzai in my riding of Barrie—Innisfil. Zarmina had gone through the situation with the Taliban earlier and had escaped Afghanistan in advance of Taliban rule. She told me she came out on a donkey to another country and found a life in Canada. She had given back to young girls in Afghanistan by trying to educate them and trying to get them to play hockey. She came into my office many times crying, begging and pleading for any way that we could help those hockey girls of Kabul to come to Canada, and asking that we do everything we could.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872188">We saw the descending chaos and it should have been no surprise to anyone here, even the government, that the Americans had already concluded that they were going to leave Afghanistan in September. There should have been better planning. We need to know this, and this is why this committee is so important. We need to find out what happened from the time the Americans announced that they were going to depart Afghanistan to the time that Afghanistan actually fell. What were the actions of the government at that time? What were the Liberals doing other than preparing for an election that nobody wanted? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872189">I will remind the House that at the time it was not just that Afghanistan was falling: Wildfires in B.C. were decimating the interior of British Columbia. The priority of the government at that time was to call an election, when it should have been dealing with all of these other issues. The desperation, the despair and the anxiety that were coming to my office, and I am sure the offices of colleagues in the House, were incredible to deal with. In fact, I did not start my campaign until two and a half weeks after the election was called because this was my focus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872190">I was supplying as many names as I could. People not just in my riding, but all across Canada and around the world were giving me names to get to the Liberal government so they could be helped in Afghanistan before everything fell. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872191">There were others. There was the Veterans Transition Network, which included Corey Shelson, a former army officer who served in Afghanistan. There were people on the ground in Afghanistan: Canadian Armed Forces veterans who were desperately putting their lives in jeopardy trying to help people at that time. Through the whole process, as we have heard several examples of today, many Canadian military personnel were on the ground; however, diplomatic officials and consular officials had been pulled back. There was nowhere for these people to go.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6872192">In fact, I have heard stories. I have emails that I will read into the record about some of the desperate attempts by people to get to the airport and what they were being told by the government about where they needed to be. In one case, people were told to go to a hotel and that there would be Canadian officials there. There were no Canadian officials there. People were risking their lives going from the safe house that they were in to this hotel, and when they got to the hotel American forces were there and they were told, “No, we're not taking any Canadians at this point.” Where were the Canadian officials? They were nowhere to be found. In one case, the 82-year-old father of a lady in my riding left that hotel only to be beaten up by members of the Taliban because they figured out why he went there. We need to know why these types of things happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872193">Another email I got stated, “Hi there, I've emailed IRCC dozens of times and now I'm asking for your help. Please, please don't let me get killed. Please help me get my family out of Afghanistan. I dedicated my life for Canada and helping any Canadian that crossed my path. Please help me.” Another said, “How long do we have to stay at this airport? This is two days. There's no water. There's no bathroom, additional security. We did not sleep and we will be dying with the situation. We are close to this gate. Where are the Canadians to help us?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872194">I cannot say what he says next, but those are the instructions that he received. This is why we have to get to the bottom of where those failures were. Why was the government too distracted at the time to help not just those Canadians who were still in Afghanistan, but those who were vulnerable?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872195">The instructions people received read, “You are receiving this message from Global Affairs Canada, Consular Services with regards to an assisted departure from Afghanistan. Please find attached a letter of facilitation which may assist you to clear checkpoints to access the Karzai Airport. We also remind you of the following guidance for the airport: Please proceed to the north gate.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872196">We know the stories of the north gate. There were people getting hung up in barbed wire, and people being shot because they were being identified by the Taliban at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872197">The instructions continued, “Wear red if you have it.” That identified people as Canadian. That is exactly what was going on. The instructions that were coming in were putting our people in peril. They also instructed, “Make your way to the front of the crowd and identify yourself as Canadian.” How could they do that when there were thousands of people who were doing the same thing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872198"> I think of Sam, whose family was there. They were told to go to the airport. They were given notice that there was a flight available to them at the airport, and they had two hours to get to the airport. They sent me the video of themselves driving to the airport. People were being shot in front of them and they were driving over dead bodies. They felt so at risk that they did not make their flight, but turned back and went home to a safe place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872199">Speaking of safe places, we know that our Canadian interpreters, those who are vulnerable, had safe houses, but they were not being funded by the government. They were being funded by private organizations and private donors raising billions of dollars. At a time when those safe houses needed to be extended, what did the Liberals do, despite being asked to fund them? The government did not cancel them, but it did not fund the extension of them. This means that right now those interpreters and their families whose houses have been blown up by the Taliban have nowhere to go. They are living out in the open in the middle of winter, being hunted down by the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872200"> We need to know why these types of things could happen. The government members can gloss over it all they want. They can paint as rosy a picture as they want. However, Afghan Canadians and others trying to help those who were vulnerable, those interpreters and others who helped us, know the truth: that it was a government that was in chaos in dealing with this situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872201">We need to know, through the proposed committee, why this situation happened so that it never happens again. We also need to better understand how we can help those who are still struggling to leave Afghanistan to come to this country.</ParaText>

The messages from IRCC and GAC in response really shocked me, because essentially they were stock answers that told people to please go away. They did not provide a resolution or an approach for how they could get to safety. Many people who received documentation from the government were not recognized at the airport and were turned away. Many wrote to GAC in the special email that was given to them, only for it to fall into a deep hole and never see daylight because they never got a response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872216">The challenge right now in Afghanistan is making sure that we get visas for the people. It is even difficult for Afghan nationals to get passports at this point because they are being pegged. They are being identified by the Taliban as wanting to leave the country. Then we have our partners in Pakistan and elsewhere who on some days keep the borders closed so that Afghan nationals cannot get into the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872222">Before I begin my speech, I would like to congratulate you, Madam Speaker, on your appointment to the position of Assistant Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. I appreciate the dignity and wisdom you bring to the role of House of Commons referee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872223">I rise in the House today to discuss the opposition's proposals with respect to the situation in Afghanistan. Their goal is to determine how we can help Afghan refugees. This is a very serious matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872224">Where to begin? First of all, this is a life and death issue. As several members have already mentioned, it is a real shame the Conservatives are making political hay out of this situation. It is outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872225">I think that all members of the House want us to reach out to the Afghans who are at risk in Afghanistan because of the Taliban government, and I would venture to say that the vast majority of Canadians want that as well. We want to help those Afghans, especially the men and women who helped us and our allies’ troops, who have been trying to bring stability to that country, which unfortunately has been torn apart by civil war and Taliban forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872226">No one is going to tell me that the Taliban can improve the well-being of the Afghan people. It is unfortunately a government run by radical Islamist forces that completely distort the tenets of this major religion. As a politician, I have had the pleasure of learning more about this religion, as I have gotten to know my Muslim constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872227">The government, the Canadian Armed Forces and Global Affairs Canada have been working very hard to ensure that we can welcome those who helped us in Afghanistan. That is remarkable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872228">As a government, we made a solemn commitment to bring 40,000 Afghan refugees to Canada. We have made a lot of progress despite some very difficult situations. Almost 4,000 people have regained their freedom here in Canada. We are working very hard on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872229">Tomorrow, another 500 Afghan refugees will arrive safely in Canada on two chartered flights. As part of a commitment we made, we are also working with the various governments to bring another 9,000 Afghan refugees to Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872230">Some progress has been made, although the situation is far from ideal. Very few credible individuals really understood how quickly the Afghan government collapsed over the summer. In spite of that, we have made a serious commitment to put in our share of the effort and bring these people home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872231">I cannot begin to describe how harmful the Taliban is to women's rights in Afghanistan. The situation that Afghans, especially women and girls, are facing is absolutely terrible. When I was younger, I studied international relations in university and I remember that we looked at what was happening in Afghanistan. It was horrifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872232">I think Canada had the right to intervene and to be part of the coalition forces that went into Afghanistan to stabilize the country and form a democratic government accountable to Afghans. Unfortunately, that was not enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872233">The Canadian Armed Forces have been out of Afghanistan for a long time now. Several governments have had the opportunity to carry on the work and do their part to welcome Afghan refugees. Everyone tried, but no government's commitment was as firm and ambitious as the one we made last summer. We made that promise to Afghans and to Canadians, and we will keep it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872234">We are keeping up our efforts in Afghanistan to bring these refugees here. We will be there for vulnerable Afghans. We will be there to repay the Afghans for their service in support of the Canadian Armed Forces stationed there. We will be there for our translators, our interpreters and the people who forged connections between our military personnel and the Afghan people. We really want to help those who need it most, and we will be there for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872235">It is important to look beyond the creation of another committee, that is, a special committee that would look at these matters. I think we are all very aware of the workload that we have. We do not need a new committee. There are already committees where these issues can be addressed.

More than 9,000 applications, under the special immigration measures to resettle Afghan nationals who assisted the Government of Canada, along with their family members, have been processed. Officials are doing all they can to stay in contact with and support those who remain in Afghanistan and wish to resettle to Canada. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872261"> The people-to-people ties between Canada and Afghanistan are strong, built over the length of our long-term deployment there, as we did our best to help secure the country and provide development and opportunity for all people of Afghanistan. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872266"> Already many Afghan refugees have been resettled in the greater Toronto area, and I want to thank local organizations such as the Afghan Women’s Organization and Agincourt Community Services Association that have been working to support and welcome them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872267">A few weeks ago, I met with a group of recently arrived Afghan refugees. As members can imagine, they are excited and relieved to be here, but they also worry about extended family left behind and what the future holds for them in Canada. We need to ensure they are supported and get answers to their questions and we need to ensure lessons learned from the Syrian refugee resettlement are applied in this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872268">I should note that at the heart of both of these programs is the government-assisted refugees program. A lot of attention is paid to privately sponsored refugees, and this is a great Canadian innovation that sees community groups come together to sponsor and support refugee families for their first year in Canada. It is an important part of our immigration and refugee system, but it cannot be our entire refugee program, which is what the Conservatives proposed just a few months ago in their election platform when they promised to do away with government-assisted refugees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872269">A look at refugee data shows that government-assisted refugees tend to be the more vulnerable, the more at risk, the more in need of Canada’s help. To turn our backs on them is to turn our backs on those that most need Canada's help, and that is not what Canada should be about. The refugees we are helping in Afghanistan are government-assisted refugees and they need Canada’s help. Therefore, my focus is on how we can help make the Afghan refugee program a success and bring these people who need our help here as quickly as we can. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872270">I do not oppose the idea of a special committee, but I think these are certainly issues the immigration and refugee committee could take up and bring its expertise to bear by bringing in witnesses from those familiar with the situation on the ground to organizations focused on resettlement to provide actionable recommendations to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872271"> What gives me pause is what seems like a very broad request for documents, many of which are likely to contain information that could compromise national security, military tactics, intelligence sources and methods, and the identity and location of Canadian citizens in Afghanistan or interpreters or contractors who assisted Canada and our allies. I do not see how this would help Canada bring more Afghan refugees to Canada. My constituents are not asking me for documents; they are asking me to help their families, and this request could potentially put their families in danger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872272">If we truly want to help the refugees, let us get the politics out of the motion and focus on what really matters here: helping those who need Canada’s help. </ParaText>

As a veteran, he has done numerous missions and tours in Afghanistan and I am looking forward to his comments later.

              <ParaText id="6872286">I am glad to be able to speak to the motion we brought forward on this day of supply, which is asking to set up a special committee to look into the crisis in Afghanistan and get our friends, allies and citizens out of Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban; to find out what lessons we can learn so we do not make these mistakes again; and to find out why this was not made a higher priority by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872287">It should not have been a surprise to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or anyone in cabinet. We know that on May 2, 2019, CSIS presented a report that said that if the United States decided to withdraw from Afghanistan, the Taliban would recapture the entire country, including the city of Kabul, in very short order. That report was in 2019. Then, of course, Donald Trump, when he was still president of the United States, announced on February 29, 2020 that he was officially withdrawing and winding down U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Of course, the coalition that Canada had been a part of in Afghanistan would not be able to be sustained without the U.S. in theatre. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872288">The question becomes this: If CSIS warned, based upon sound intelligence, that Afghanistan would be quickly captured by the Taliban, and Donald Trump announced the withdrawal in February 2020, why did the government not act? Instead of planning for the withdrawal and making sure we got our interpreters out before the country started to fall under the control of the brutal Taliban and the harsh conditions that exist there today, we could have been moving people out. Instead, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> planned for a selfish and unnecessary, $650-million election. That is despicable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872289">Many of us on this side of the House and even members on the other side were getting contacted by veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces. They were pleading with all of us to get their friends who were over there out. These were people they served alongside, who supported them as interpreters and drivers and made sure their base camps and forward-operating locations were safe and secure. They served together. They were a team. We lost 158 Canadian soldiers, and over 40,000 served. Our Canadian veterans who served developed great relationships and considered their allies to be brothers and sisters in arms. To then see the government turn its back on these allies was so disheartening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872290">The true heroes throughout all of this have been those veterans. I would like to mention guys like Corey Shelson, Tim and Jamie Laidler, General David Fraser and General Denis Thompson, among others who have really done yeoman's service in organizing and getting people out of Afghanistan. In particular, because I and my office have been working closely with him, I want to highlight Robin Rickards from Thunder Bay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872291">Robin has had multiple tours in Afghanistan. He started contacting me over six years ago regarding getting these interpreters out of the country. Under the previous Conservative government, we had a special immigration program for Afghanistan interpreters. It got filled up; people quit applying and it wound down. We were able to get a few more out after that, as the <Affiliation DbId="263838" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> mentioned this morning in his speech. However, the reality is that people like Corey just would not quit, and they forewarned the government and us as members of Parliament. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="278656" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation> worked incredibly closely with Robin as well. </ParaText>

Nothing seemed to happen until the fall of Kabul in the middle of a federal election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872293">These veterans, through the Veterans Transition Network and many other NGOs, raised money to fund the safe houses. Generous donations came in from veterans, current serving members and Canadians at large. They chartered flights, bought airline tickets and continued to build both the air bridge and the land bridge to safe havens for those who were left behind. Of course, because they were relying on generosity and because things started to heat up so desperately, the money for those safe houses started to run out. On behalf of those veterans, a number of us asked in this House and in writing if the Government of Canada would give the organizations $5 million, so that we could keep the safe houses open and keep those interpreters and their families, the hundreds of people who were in the safe houses, safe in Kabul. The government callously said no. Five million dollars is a drop in the bucket around this place, and it would have gone a long way to protecting Afghan interpreters who were waiting to be processed as applicants to come to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872294">The people in the Veterans Transition Network really did a lot of heavy lifting. They were part of the group that identified and made sure that the people making claims to come to Canada as refugees had served with our forces and had all their documents in order. They were reaching out to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to get all the applications processed, but unfortunately all of that kind of went up in smoke when the fall of Kabul happened. We saw the complete chaos that occurred at the Kabul airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872295">Since that time in the middle of August, when we saw the chaos and craziness that happened, our allies, like Germany and the United States, have continued to move out the refugees and citizens at risk, as well as interpreters and support staff to their armed forces, without any problem. They have been chartering flights in and out of Kabul non-stop. That is why the United States is already sitting on something like over 40,000 refugees in the mainland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872296">However, we are not seeing that happen here. Why is the Government of Canada not chartering those flights or at least making sure there are tickets on commercial aircraft for all those applicants who are sitting there waiting in Kabul or Kandahar to get out?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872297">The Liberals talk a good game. We see the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">minister of immigration</Affiliation> almost throw his shoulder out every question period here, patting himself on the back for getting 4,000 Afghan refugees out so far. The Canadian Armed Forces identified over 23,600, yet IRCC has processed only 14,675 and there are only 4,000 here so far. That means there are 9,600 Afghan refugees, interpreters, LGBTQ community members, and ethnic and religious minorities like the Hindi, the Sikh and the Hazaras, all sitting there waiting to be processed. They made the applications, yet red tape seems to be holding them back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872298">I have to thank my staff. They have been dealing directly with Afghan refugees, with our interpreters and our friends and allies, including Canadian citizens who are still trapped in Afghanistan. Some of them had to leave Kabul when the safe houses closed. They went back to their homes only to find that they had either been burnt down or were being lived in by the Taliban themselves. There were actually notices issued to arrest them. I know some went back, saying, “If I turn myself in, maybe they won't kill my family and they'll execute only me.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872299">We have so many stories of people who served with our forces, who served as journalists and who have been left behind and given up on Canada. That is not the Canada we are supposed to be. We are supposed to be the Canada that, because of the great work of our men and women in uniform who go out there and right the evils in the world, stands up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Those people sacrificed blood and treasure in serving Canada. Let us support our veterans and let us bring home those Afghan allies who served with us.</ParaText>

The Harper administration, from 2009 to 2011, did offer an immigration stream for Afghan interpreters. However, with that program there were very specific requirements. First, they had to have served 12 months before they could qualify for that measure, and second, it applied only if they had served from 2007 onward. That is to say that if they served before 2007, they did not qualify. If they served 360 days as opposed to 365 days, they did not qualify.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6872314">Madam Speaker, considering this is my first speech here in the House in this new Parliament, I want to thank the constituents of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound for giving me the privilege and honour of representing them here once again. I thank my family, all my volunteers and everybody who helped get me back here to the House of Commons. It truly is a privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872315">Before getting into the details of this motion, I want to thank all the Daves, Coreys, Pauls, Eleanors, retired generals and so many NGOs and charities that have been working behind the scenes on this issue for months now. This includes the Afghan Strategic Evaluation Team, the Veterans Transition Network, the Journalists for Human Rights, the Afghan Canadian interpreters, Building Markets, Aman Lara and Raven Rae Resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872316">I also want to thank a former colleague of mine, Greg from Nova Scotia. He has a full-time job running his own business and he comes home at night and spends upward of five to six hours talking to his contacts on the ground in Afghanistan helping get Afghans and Afghan Canadians across the border, facilitating visas and getting them out of that country and to safety. I thank all of these people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872317">I want to address why this motion and this committee is so important. There are two key reasons and we have mentioned these already during the debate. First is we have to learn what went right and what went wrong. Canada cannot make the same mistakes in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872318">As I mentioned earlier, it is great to identify what went wrong, but if someone does not learn from it and apply it in the future, it is all a waste of time. This is key for any future diplomatic, humanitarian or military mission, regardless of where it is in the world, as we deal with risks. More importantly, we need to do this so that we can help those Afghans who are still in dire need of our support, and are being actively hunted by the Taliban. Their lives are at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872319">To provide some background to the members here in the House who maybe do not know who I am, I spent over 25 years in the military. I spent two deployments in Afghanistan. The first was in 2007 in active combat, where I depended on these interpreters daily in order to communicate, understand the cultural differences and do my job to help give them a better life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872320">The biggest thing I remember from that tour, more than anything, is talking to the local Afghans. They are no different from any one of us. People around the world are all the same. They just want to live in peace and prosperity, put food on the table and allow their children to have a better life than them. Under the Taliban, women and girls cannot go to school. We should always be fighting against regimes like this, no matter where they are in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872321">My next deployment was in 2012. I did eight months over there with the Canadian contribution to the NATO training mission. We were actually trying to put the hard work in to develop the institutional capacity of that country. Again, it is impossible to do without cultural advisers and interpreters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872322">We took one of the regional military training centres in Kabul during that deployment and we turned it into a language school. Not to teach them English, but to teach them Pashto and Dari because a lot of the recruits coming through their military or police forces could not read or write to a grade 3 level. It is hard to fight corruption, fraud and other challenges that Afghanistan faces if one cannot communicate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872323">We had many Afghans who were helping in NATO missions, helping Canadians and helping Canada accomplish what we wanted to do in that country and now we are failing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872324">The Taliban are brutal and I am going to get into a specific example momentarily. Again, as my hon. colleague who spoke just before me, the former shadow minister for defence said, this was predicted; we knew this was coming. The former minister of national defence was briefed on the security situation and the probable Taliban resurgence tied to the U.S. withdrawal over two years ago. Former president Trump gave that deadline and indicated that the U.S. were going to withdraw. This was reiterated by President Biden. The Liberal MP, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278656" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation> raised these concerns two years ago with the Liberal government.</ParaText>

While talking with my own interpreters at that time, they shared their own concerns that this is why many used aliases and always kept their faces covered during interactions in order to protect themselves and their families.

              <ParaText id="6872334">To get to the motion at hand and why this committee is so important, I am going to actually offer a bunch of solutions that this committee should focus on, providing that we get the support for it today. They have come from these NGOs, charities, people and former veterans who are working behind the scenes, as they were shared with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872335">Priority one is to stand up an interdepartmental task force focused on safeguarding and evacuating eligible Afghans remaining in Afghanistan. Priority must be on having a single leader to run the interdepartmental task force empowered to coordinate and execute this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872336">The feedback that I have been receiving is that for GAC and IRCC, during the evacuation operations by our Canadian Armed Forces, interdepartmental communications were not working. Additional resources have to be brought to bear. IRCC staff are being overwhelmed and likely experiencing vicarious PTSD because they do not have the policies, support and leadership to solve the problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872337">Another thing that this committee could be focused on is application processing as 45% of the applicants that certain NGOs are tracking still have not had their initiating email to IRCC responded to in order to make that application. Only 20% of those who NGOs believe are eligible have been issued IRCC numbers that suggest that they might be successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872338">None of the employees that Canadian NGOs are tracking who work in Afghanistan to advance Canada's mission have been successful in their application to come to Canada under the special immigration measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872339">The majority of applicants with approved applications do not have passports. A mechanism needs to be put in place to get these people who do not have passports out of Afghanistan. Applying for a passport at this time can result in a family being targeted and killed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872340">Next, we need to leverage the charities, the NGOs and the veterans. The Canadian government needs to find a way to leverage our partners and our vets to get biometrics into Kabul. This would allow the government and NGOs to move people out of the country directly without having to accumulate them in third countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872341">There need to be less restrictive funding parameters. I understand that this funding needs to be tracked but right now it is too bureaucratic, too complicated to get the help needed as mentioned to support these safe houses and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872342">In conclusion, we need this special committee. We need to learn what went right and what went wrong and we need to ensure the appropriate urgent actions are taken by the government. These Afghans stepped up for Canada. Now, in their time of need, Canada needs to step up for them.</ParaText>

I would also like to acknowledge that of all of us, 338 in this House, likely no one has as much experience or perspective on this issue. I want to thank the hon. member for adding to that discourse today. I hear what he said regarding the need for a committee.

If we do not learn from what went right and what went wrong and we do not capture that properly and understand where the challenges are across departments, we are doomed to make the same mistake on a future mission and we are going to have a heck of a lot more trouble getting those interpreters and foreign nationals to work with us in future missions.</ParaText>

I think the record was almost 800 on one flight alone, so the capacity exists to get these Afghans to Canada in a much more expedited fashion. This is all about risk assessment. We are not getting them directly out of Afghanistan anymore because the Taliban controls everything. However, as we work with the other solutions that I propose, we can definitely bring more of them to Canada faster.</ParaText>

I am very honoured that the people of Montarville have put their trust in me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872357">That was my 12th election campaign and 11th victory overall. Six of those campaigns and wins were at the federal level. I am particularly proud to participate in this Parliament with all of the members here. I congratulate each and every one of you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872358">I would like to warmly thank the members of the Bloc Québécois in Montarville, especially the members of the election committee and the volunteers who worked hard to achieve the outcome that we did. Finally, I would, of course, like to thank my family, without whom I would not be able to do this extremely demanding job. I do not think I have to tell any of you that it is a huge challenge for our loved ones, our family members and our friends. I think we should be grateful for the sacrifices they make to allow us to be here and to represent the people of our respective ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872359">In fact, there is no better introduction to today's debate than to talk about the election campaign. During the election campaign and in the days that followed, all the immigration issues in our respective ridings were put on hold because the government was in the process of extricating itself after the gross mismanagement of the situation in Afghanistan, which is what we are talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872360">The government delayed in taking action and then went into panic mode and dealt with the situation in a haphazard way in the middle of the election campaign. It imposed extremely bureaucratic measures on people who wanted to get out of Afghanistan and who were in the most dire straits. It was an absolute disaster. That is for sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872361">While the UN Security Council was calling an emergency meeting to consider what was happening in Afghanistan and while Prime Minister Boris Johnson was recalling the British Parliament, what was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada doing? He was calling an election on the very day Kabul fell. That is how seriously the Canadian Prime Minister took what was happening. As the international community was mobilizing, the best thing the Canadian Prime Minister could come up with was to call an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872362">Of course, that led to a number of problems. We have been talking about it since this morning, we are still talking about it, and I imagine we are going to be talking about it for quite some time. Again today, the Prime Minister is saying, “We will be there”. However, think about the Canadians still stuck in Afghanistan in full violation of their constitutional right to return to Canada and our Afghan allies, without whom our armed forces could not have done their work and whose lives are being threatened. What good does it do them to hear the Prime Minister say, “We will be there”? Where was the Canadian government when these individuals needed it this summer?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872363">What is rather fascinating is that the government seemed to be taken by surprise by what was happening even though the withdrawal had been announced a year earlier. The Taliban did move quickly, perhaps more quickly than anticipated by the West, but the withdrawal had been scheduled for August 31. It was no surprise because everyone knew that western forces would withdraw on August 31. Why was there such chaos when the withdrawal had been announced in advance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872364">The confusing communications by the government in the first hours after the fall of Kabul clearly demonstrated that the government had made absolutely no plans for August 31.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872365">As is often the case when political crises or natural disasters occur, the Canadian government moved quickly to close its embassy after the fall of Kabul, literally leaving Canadian citizens still in the country in the lurch and in the dark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872366">The Canadian evacuation ended on August 26, or a few days before the August 31 deadline. We wonder why the government was in such a hurry to end an evacuation operation when some countries, such as Mexico, were still there after Canada left. Why was Mexico able to maintain a presence in the country while Canada decided it was time to decamp?</ParaText>

This brings us to the heart of the motion we have before us today. How can we learn from what happened so that we can do better in the future?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872368">The Conservative Party, the official opposition, is proposing a way to do that through the motion tabled by the Leader of the Opposition, without any prior discussion. That is in keeping with how the Conservatives tend to do things and what they did with the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations, or CACN, right after the 2019 election. I guess the Conservatives have done all they thought they could do with CACN because, oddly enough, they are not interested in that committee at all anymore.</ParaText>

We now have an opportunity to realign Canada's policy on China, and this is when the Conservatives choose not to continue CACN's work. I was very surprised by that because my Conservative colleagues told me informally that they wanted to do so. Now the Conservatives have come to us with a new gimmick, or what I would venture to call, to quote myself, a “convoluted hare-brained scheme”, with this much-vaunted committee on the situation in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872370">I read the motion very carefully and I would say that the only quasi-good thing I can say about the Conservative proposal is that it prevents us from working in silos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872371">Since this morning, the Liberals have been asking us whether the Standing Committee on National Defence, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, and the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration could not address this. Yes, they could, but the problem is that only one of those three committees will do it and some important aspects of the problem could fall through the cracks if we leave this to just one committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872372">Perhaps one of the only merits of the Conservative motion is that it ensures that we do not work in a vacuum or in silos and that we have a special committee to address this situation and allow us to get to the bottom of things, but what are we trying to get to the bottom of? This is about picking at a scab that the Liberal government caused. As we know, the situation was a fiasco.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872373">Now, we can try to understand why in order to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6872374">What we want to know is how we can get the more than 1,000 Canadian nationals who are stuck in Afghanistan out of there. How can we help our Afghan allies who are still stuck in Afghanistan and whose lives are at risk every day? How can we support the Afghan people who are threatened with starvation? What can we do for the women and girls who are once again under the control of the Taliban fundamentalist government? This is what we want to know, but there is no mention of any of that in the Conservatives' motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872375">I want to go through the details of the motion's introduction. Several aspects of the introduction seem to indicate that the intent is to discuss the government's so-called lack of “contingency planning” and “subsequent efforts to evacuate”, but it makes no mention of the humanitarian crisis that is developing in Afghanistan, which is something that we should be considering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872376"> In point (b), the motion gives the whips of each party 24 hours to submit a list of members, which is not a problem. Points (a), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) are acceptable. We do not have a problem there. The same goes for points (h), (i) and (j).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872377"> However, in paragraph (k) they draw up a list of ministers they would like to call before the committee, probably to put them on the hot seat and score some political points. The Conservatives got us accustomed to that during the last Parliament. Next are paragraphs (l) and (m).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872378">Paragraph (m) is quite fascinating because it asks for a whole series of documents without knowing if they are the least bit relevant. Then it goes on to say that the government has one month to produce these documents. What is the date today? It is December 7. It says one month, which means that the government would have to provide all these documents by January 7. Our Conservative friends figure that the people at Foreign Affairs are going to spend December 24, 25, 26 and 31, as well as January 1 and 2, working on this to satisfy them, otherwise there would be a scandal, contempt of Parliament and then a question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872379">We would be hard-pressed to find a better example of political theatre by the Conservative Party. I think our Conservative friends may have had good intentions, but in reality, the motion is riddled with very clear indications that they wanted to make this an extremely partisan exercise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872380">As I said, what we are interested in is finding out what is going to happen to Afghans facing famine, to the women and girls who are once again being controlled by an Islamist government, to our Afghan allies who risk death every day they remain in that country and to Canadian nationals who are still stuck in Afghanistan. That is what we are interested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872381">That is why we asked ourselves how we could amend this motion to make it acceptable, not just a Conservative smoke and mirrors show. As it stands, it would create a committee focused solely on making political hay by picking at the wounds of the past. How can we change it to create a committee that will really do useful work by looking at future-focused solutions, making recommendations to the government and learning from what happened so we can do better, which was the hope the minister shared this afternoon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872382">Canadian nationals and allies are still stuck in Afghanistan. The people there are facing one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent years. We must take rapid, constructive action. We have to work together.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6872383">While some members of the House have yet to understand the message sent by the voters of Canada and Quebec, they need only look at the results of the last election. The House of Commons ended up with more or less the same composition as the previous Parliament, which was dissolved on August 15. In other words, the voters were reminding us of the mandate they gave us in 2019 to work together. It is possible for us to do what voters asked, what they elected us to do, which is to work together?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872384">It is therefore a little surprising that the Conservatives would move such a motion at the beginning of this new Parliament, when the people have told us they want us to work together to come up with solutions, not to try to find every possible and unimaginable opportunity to score political points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872385">In that spirit of collaboration, we proposed an amendment to the Conservatives, one that we also submitted to our friends in the other political parties. The Conservatives have considered our proposed amendment, and I believe we are close to a solution that will allow us to embark on a very productive process. At least that is my hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872386">If we want to talk about the past, I respectfully submit to our Conservative friends that they should not throw stones because they are living in a glass house in some respects. When the Conservative government ended the Canadian mission in Afghanistan, it was also asked at that time to evacuate Afghan interpreters, and it did not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872387">Had the evacuation gone ahead at that time, when our hands were not tied and we could have taken action, we probably would not be in the situation we find ourselves in today. If the Conservatives decide to pick at the wounds of the past, they could be seen in an equally bad light. The Conservatives and the Liberals must stop doing this and try to find positive solutions to move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872388">I heard my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278158" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation> say how proud he was of the Canadian troops in Afghanistan. I agree with him. Having been a member of the armed forces in the past, I can say that we can all be very proud of the work of the Canadian military in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872389">That said, it is absolutely tragic that 158 of our own lost their lives and many more returned with permanent physical and psychological injuries only to see those they tried to overthrow by intervening in that country return to power. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872420">Beyond this global vision, in my opinion, this is part of the debate that we must have. Would a committee such as the one proposed, with the amendments suggested, not make it possible to put pressure on the Liberal government to keep this issue in the news and to continue to bring it up, perhaps to speed things up so that the Canadians still stuck there and the allies who helped us, regardless of what we think of this mission, can be repatriated as soon as possible?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872448">In 2006, three young men lost their lives too soon in Afghanistan. To this day, their families reside in and around Truro, Nova Scotia, which is part of my riding of Cumberland—Colchester. Warrant Officer Frank Mellish is survived by his wife and two children. His parents, Barry and Sandy Mellish, are friends of mine and were also patients at my medical practice. Corporal Chris Reid was a single man and the son of Tom and Angela. When he died, he was their only surviving child. Their other child, a daughter, died in 2002. At a Remembrance Day ceremony this year at the Truro Legion, I had the opportunity to lay a wreath on behalf of the Government of Canada while Tom and Angela laid a wreath as Silver Cross parents. Sergeant Darcy Tedford left behind a wife and two daughters. He is the son of Robin and Paulette Tedford, who are also people I know very well in Cumberland—Colchester. They miss their son every day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872449">They are three Silver Cross families in one small community in Nova Scotia. So, is this personal for me, for many Canadians and certainly for the Afghans left behind? Madam Speaker, you can bet it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872450">I spent nine years in uniform as a flight surgeon serving our great nation in Shearwater and Comox, and in Kuwait and Bahrain. My brother continues to serve. He indeed served at the KAF from July 2010 until January 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872451"> Despite the significant losses of their sons, these three families are still amazing patriots. They believe in Canada and the work the Canadian Armed Forces was tasked to do in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the withdrawal of the Canadian Forces from Afghanistan has left a bitter taste and indelible stain on our Canadian reputation. Canada is known globally as a nation founded on democracy and human rights. Since the 1960s, Canada has used these principles to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in the hope that it would one day enjoy peace and stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872452">The story of the descent of Afghanistan into civil war after the withdrawal of international troops should come as no surprise. Sadly, it appears to be a significant retelling of the same tale that happened after the former Soviet Union withdrew from its decades-long war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The Taliban regained control and severely limited civil rights. It would appear that terrorist groups ran rampant, which of course led us to the events of September 11, 2001. The Canadian role in Afghanistan evolved during the time of the conflict. In the early days, we were primarily based as an interdiction force on the seas. Subsequent to this, our air power was tasked to support the efforts on the ocean and soon after forces from JTF 2 were on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872453">As time rolled on into 2003, we provided support to other nations in Kabul patrolling the western part of the city. Over time, once again the Canadian role changed. In 2005 Taliban activity in Kandahar ramped up and with the Canadians there it became clear that more forces were required on the ground to combat the significant Taliban forces. It has become well known that Canadians involved in this attempt to stem Taliban insurgency were under ever-present danger as they went outside the wire, which sadly brings me back to 2006, at which time Warrant Officer Mellish, Sergeant Tedford and Corporal Reid were killed in action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872454">All of this has come at a significant cost. There were 158 Canadians who died; countless others have been both physically and mentally changed forever and their families have been significantly affected. The incredible toll this has taken on our soldiers is not well represented by the number of casualties we suffered. This was a war of uncertainty, IEDs and one that now has an ending that has left many soldiers feeling let down by their country.</ParaText>

Post World War II, Canada remained involved from a military perspective in Germany for 50 years. We now have a robust export to Germany worth $6 billion annually as of 2020. After seeing the colossal failure of the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the chaos that ensued and given our history in Germany, how could we think that a rapid drawing out of forces without significant support would be or could be successful?</ParaText>

This summer the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, and our soldiers in Canada's armed forces as well as Afghans who served Canada were at risk. Instead of prioritizing this crisis and taking action, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> called an election. As chaos ensued outside Kabul's airport, the Prime Minister was asked whether he regretted announcing the election. His answer was a resounding no.</ParaText>

Many of them continue to hide to this day, because the Liberal government has brought to Canada less than 10% of the Afghan refugees that it promised. To make matters worse, this October the Liberal government's data breach threatened the lives of several hundred vulnerable Afghans seeking refuge from the Taliban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872462"> Canada's reputation as a compassionate country is now tarnished as our government has turned its back on vulnerable people, but we can change that. The first step is to create an all-party special committee on Canada's Afghanistan response.

              <ParaText id="6872463">As the Taliban continues to hunt for remaining Afghans who supported Canada during our mission to Afghanistan, now is the time for action. Our Conservative Party is taking action right now. We need the special committee to understand that the errors which were made are not repeated. We must find ways to repatriate our supporters and restore Canada to its rightful and historic place on the world stage. Make no mistake: This is urgent and lives are at stake.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872615">Madam Chair, I thank the minister for his answer. I would like to point out that the Bloc Québécois is calling on the government to make a public and formal commitment to support self-employed workers in the cultural sector and to not leave them behind. A few years ago, we asked the government to distinguish between employed and self-employed workers. In Quebec, this is what we see in most cases. It is such an important sector that we think it is absolutely necessary to protect it and to help people get through the pandemic in order to preserve their expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872616">There is something else to consider in terms of supporting businesses and workers affected by the pandemic. In the bill currently before us, there is special concern for the tourism and hospitality sector, which includes the entire cultural sector. This is a well-defined initiative and we welcome it. However, we do have some concerns about other sectors that are very important to us and that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. I will give a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872617">Looking at the figures published by manufacturing associations, we see that the aerospace sector has a long way to go before it gets back to pre-pandemic revenue levels. A number of other manufacturing sectors are also struggling, including the many companies that are facing a shortage of semiconductor-based chips. They are struggling and facing cash flow and labour retention problems. They have skilled labour, and they do not want to lose it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872618">My preamble was long, but here is my question. Currently, these sectors do not have the same support as the tourism and hospitality sector. Today, in committee, senior officials confirmed that the Governor in Council has the power to amend such legislation by regulation. Will the government commit to doing so if there is a demonstrated need?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872622">Once again, we in the Bloc Québécois expect a formal commitment from the government to be prepared to step in and amend by regulation the parameters of the upcoming bills passed to support the sectors most affected. As a society we cannot afford to turn our backs on them. The purpose of assistance programs is to collectively support these strategic industries so that they can get through the pandemic. That is really important to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872623">Now I would like to point to another situation. Since the summer, we have all heard from seniors in our ridings who are experiencing really terrible financial hardship. Some are in disastrous situations, for example working seniors who receive the guaranteed income supplement. When the pandemic kit, those who had to stop working were told to apply for the CERB. However, the benefits they receive are taken into account in the calculation of the guaranteed income supplement they are entitled to. The government is telling them that they received too much money, that either they pay it back or their guaranteed income supplement will be clawed back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872624">Among the points I would like to raise, I wish to touch on three issues concerning the Canada emergency response benefit and the guaranteed income supplement for seniors. First, the Bloc Québécois is asking that CERB payments be considered employment income for the purposes of calculating the GIS, so that recipients are not penalized as much. Otherwise, seniors will fall well below the poverty line and will be unable to make ends meet. The criteria were poorly explained, which has caused a lot of problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872625">Second, the guaranteed income supplement should be recalculated immediately, regardless of whether seniors dealt with Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency. At first, depending on the agency, applications could not be made. Now, any applications are systematically rejected, as though by a computer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872626">Third, it should be possible to make repayments over three years, rather than over the current year. Some seniors earning $1,500 a month have to pay back $800 or $900 a month, which leaves them with just $600 to cover rent and living expenses. That is an impossible situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872627">Is the government committed to correcting this injustice? If so, how, and when?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872628">Madam Chair, I thank my hon. colleague for giving me the opportunity to lay out the real facts about everything that has happened in our economy since the pandemic hit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872629">I want to emphasize that the Canadian economy has almost fully recovered. We have recovered 106% of the jobs lost at the height of the pandemic. Earlier this week, we learned that 154,000 jobs had been added to our economy. That points to one very important fact I want to stress this evening: We rebuilt our economy rapidly after the recession. This is the shortest economic recovery in Canadian history. I think it is very important to point out how entrepreneurs across the country and our government set the stage for such a strong and powerful economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872630">To answer my hon. colleague's question, we know how difficult the pandemic is for seniors. I have spoken about this with my constituents. I spoke to people who voted for me, for us, and they are asking for our help. That is why we worked very hard during the campaign. We stated very clearly in our platform that we are here to improve seniors' lives, and that is why we worked hard to improve seniors' income security, including the guaranteed income supplement, or GIS. We created the CERB to help people at the height of the pandemic, and we know that some seniors who usually receive the GIS are facing certain challenges today because they received the CERB. Resolving this problem is a complex task, but we will do it because we are up to the challenge. We are making a solemn promise to seniors across Canada.</ParaText>

We obviously expect the government to take quick action to rectify the inequity associated with CERB and the GIS. This is essentially a humanitarian issue. Some seniors in my riding say they are no longer able to pay for medication, even though Quebec has pharmacare. They are therefore choosing to go to the hospital, since that is the only place where they can get their medication covered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872632">One of my Bloc Québécois colleagues told me about a woman who was no longer able to pay rent, so she had to sell her furniture and move into a friend's room. Once she is able to pay her debts, she will not be able to find housing comparable to what she had before, given the rising cost of rent. She will have to buy new furniture and settle in a new place.

I am wondering if the numbers here in the estimates reflect lapsed funding from delays in provincial leave extensions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872682">Mr. Speaker, when listening to the government, one sometimes wonders whether we are getting past the pandemic or not. What we saw here was an all-party willingness to suspend some of the normal financial procedures while we were in the thick of the crisis. Liberals are telling people who are on CRB that it is too bad; it is done and they should get back to work, whether they qualify for the positions or not, or whether there is government assistance to help them get the training they need or not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872683">It is time for the government to get back to work and to experience accountability to Parliament. One way to do that would be to improve the estimates process, and one of the signature ways of doing that would be to commit to a fixed budget date. We saw suspension of some of the rules around the estimates that were mandated in a time of crisis. Surely Parliament would be willing to do that in respect to the budget. However, in the meantime, Canadians have a right to expect regular reporting from their government on the budget. Therefore, will the minister support a fixed budget date?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872686">In response to this extraordinary situation, our government has taken unprecedented action thanks to the collective effort of so many people working tirelessly to help their fellow citizens. We have put in place a comprehensive package of measures to help workers and businesses across the country meet these challenges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872687">We saw neighbours helping neighbours, frontline workers who did double and triple shifts to keep our communities safe, and people who retooled their entire business lines to produce protective equipment for frontline workers and Canadians in need. In this time of historic commitment to helping others, our government was there to ensure that Canadians, their families, their businesses and their communities would be supported through the worst.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6872688">Our income and wage support programs, along with rent subsidies, made it possible for households to support their families. Those programs also enabled millions of Canadians to keep their jobs and hundreds of thousands of Canadian businesses to keep operating during the darkest days of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872689">Thanks to robust public health measures, vaccination rates are high and the child vaccination campaign is moving along quickly.

              <ParaText id="6872690">While the recent emergence of the omicron variant of COVID-19 is cause for concern, there is still reason for cautious optimism that we are turning the corner in the fight against this virus and seeing better days. Thanks to the hard work of Canadians, we are approaching the last mile of this long and difficult journey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872691">On the economic front, the recent OECD December 2021 economic outlook confirmed that Canada is still expected to have a strong recovery relative to pre-pandemic levels of GDP, ranking the second-fastest among G7 economies by 2023. Of the three million jobs that were lost at the peak of the crisis, all have now been recouped, faster than after any other recession. This has been possible because of the supports we provided. They prevented unnecessary increases in insolvencies and kept Canadians and Canadian businesses largely intact. They limited economic scarring and laid the foundation for a strong recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872692">In my riding of Edmonton Centre, I spoke with the now third-generation owners of Kunitz Shoes. The owners live in my riding. It is a third-generation shoe store on Jasper Avenue. It was going to go under, but because of collaboration with other business leaders in the community and due to the supports that we had in place, Kunitz Shoes is now thriving and back on its feet, if members will excuse the pun. The owners told me that they paid taxes, in their case for over 60 years, with the expectation that when they needed it, the government would be there for them. They said it had never happened in the history of the company, but it happened in the past year. The government was there for them, and they thanked me and my colleagues for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872693">In short, the government took action and it worked. Canadians and most parliamentarians supported this unprecedented spending because they understood that it was not only the compassionate thing to do, but also the economically smart thing to do. Our government strongly respects that Parliament plays a key role in enforcing this accountability, and I would like to recognize all members participating in the committee of the whole tonight for their role in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872694">The Department of Finance has also played a key role in enforcing this accountability through its budgets, fiscal updates and reports to Parliament, and it will continue to do so. Further to this goal, as the <Affiliation DbId="278943" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has announced, the government will be providing an economic fiscal update on December 14. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872695">Through these supplementary estimates, the government is seeking parliamentary approval for $8.7 billion in new voted spending. These planned expenditures would support Canadian priorities with infrastructure and services to address the specific needs of indigenous communities, the government's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and supporting access to COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics in developing countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872696">In fact, approximately $1.2 billion of the proposed voted spending in supplementary estimates (B) is for the government's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that Canadians are counting on this funding to protect their health and well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872697">However, Canadians are not just counting on us to invest in their health and well-being. Canadians need and want good jobs with fair wages and clear rules. Therefore, we need to make sure that businesses, especially small businesses, have the support they need. That is why we have introduced Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document> in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872698">Among other things, the bill would extend the Canada recovery hiring program until May 2022 at an increased 50% subsidy rate. This would encourage businesses to continue to rehire workers, increase their hours and create additional jobs that Canada needs for a full recovery from the COVID-19 recession.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872699">That said, the government is also aware that some businesses are unable to resume all their activities and create those jobs because of the public health measures that, as I said, are necessary to protect Canadians. We are therefore proposing in Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document> two new support programs targeting specific types of businesses in order to promote economic recovery. In both cases, the businesses must show that they experienced significant revenue declines during the first 12 months of the pandemic as well as the current month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872700">I will start with the tourism and hospitality recovery program, which will help hotels, restaurants and travel agencies, which are still grappling with public health restrictions and the fact that people are travelling less because of the measures in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872701">The Canada emergency wage subsidy and Canada emergency rent subsidy rate for these businesses will be 40% for those with a current-month revenue loss of 40%. The rate would increase in proportion to this revenue loss up to a maximum of 75%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872702">This legislation is key to getting us to the end of this pandemic and it is unfortunate that our colleagues in the Conservative Party and the NDP are voting against it. Make no mistake: This support will be crucial to getting our tourism sector back on its feet. I spoke with many leading tourism operators and businesses at the Tourism Industry Association of Canada's conference here last week and I can say that they are emphatically asking and demanding that everyone in the chamber support Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872703">Since taking on the role of Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance, I have been moved by the passion of those in the tourism sector for the work that they do.

              <ParaText id="6872704">At this moment, this industry is reeling from the body blow of this pandemic. Revenue has declined almost 50% from 2019 levels. Jobs directly attributable to tourism decreased 41% from 692,000 to 409,000 in the same period.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6872705">However, even with these challenges, Canada’s tourism sector is moving forward, and our government recognizes the vital role that tourism plays in providing employment and opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses and further fuelling economic growth. In short, our economy will not fully recover until the tourism sector recovers. With government support, businesses in this sector are starting to get ready to welcome Canadians back to experience the great places and activities this country has to offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872706">This support includes the measures introduced in budget 2021 to support the tourism sector, totalling $1 billion over three years.

              <ParaText id="6872801">I would remind hon. members that over the past year, Health Canada has played a key role in the immunization campaign against COVID-19, the biggest campaign in Canada's history. So far, Health Canada has authorized the use of four different COVID-19 vaccines. The Government of Canada has invested more than $9 billion to procure vaccines and treatments, as well as to provide international vaccine aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872802">Last week, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, or NACI, updated its recommendations for the use of booster doses. NACI has made a strong recommendation that the COVID-19 booster dose should be made available to adults over 50 years of age and further recommends that it may be offered to persons 18 to 49 years of age with consideration of individual risks and where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872803">As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, we have a secure supply of vaccines in Canada and we will receive more early in the new year.

              <ParaText id="6872915">Now more than ever, in a world where the ground keeps shifting beneath our feet, Canada must stand with its allies and leverage its bilateral and multilateral relationships to confront the rise of authoritarianism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872916">Canada must show leadership in building and leading coalitions to uphold a rules-based international system. Having the right resources in the right places is critical to achieving this goal. The Speech from the Throne is clear on this point. We need to expand and adapt our diplomatic presence around the world. We need to do this within multilateral institutions and in specific regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872917"> Multilateralism is at the very heart of Canadian diplomatic culture, particularly since Lester B. Pearson. Thanks to our personal and strategic involvement, Canada was able to play a role in the great advances of the 20th century, such as the Blue Helmets, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the banning of landmines, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872918">Today, we continue to be instrumental in the great issues of our era, namely fighting climate change, promoting gender equality and protecting our environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872919">Many regions must also draw our attention, particularly as China is growing its influence around the world. No region will be more important to Canada's ability to address its priorities than the Indo-Pacific. As was mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, Canada intends to deepen its engagement with Indo-Pacific countries and partners. We will work on all fronts: diplomatic, security, sustainable development and economic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872920">Diplomatically speaking, we will work closely with our friends and partners to protect the rules-based international order. Canada will promote inclusive and open regional governance, accountability and human rights. Canada also recognizes the need to reinforce our support to Indo-Pacific regional security and stability. We will ensure, with our like-minded partners, the future security environment is favourable to Canada's interests and those of our friends and allies in the region. For example, we will do so by taking part in joint operations in the region, most recently through the involvement of Canada's frigate HMCS <I>Winnipeg</I>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872921">Despite the pandemic, the Indo-Pacific remains a critical hub for global trade, investment, production and supply chains. Canada's post-COVID success hinges upon our private sector's ability to expand market access and pursue economic opportunities in the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872922">We need to diversify our trading partners. We all know that, and our supply chains in the regions also need to not be overly dependent on one market. On November 16, 2021, Canada and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations launched negotiations toward a Canada-ASEAN free trade agreement. This potential agreement would help create new market opportunities for Canadian goods and services while supporting a more transparent and predictable environment for trade and investments. Frankly, we owe it to the entrepreneurs at home. They need to have access to every opportunity the world has to offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6872923">Canada's pursuit of these goals must be done in a way that aligns with our global commitments to act on climate change and sustainability. Indeed, no region will be more consequential than the Indo-Pacific in shaping our ability to meet and exceed our global commitments and targets. A renewed commitment to this issue in the Indo-Pacific will reinforce Canada's standing as a global leader in this regard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6872935">We are, however, realistic, since recent events have brought some strong protectionist tendencies to light and, of course, we must protect Canadian interests, especially with respect to electric vehicles and softwood lumber.</ParaText>

Allow me to share a few facts about why Asia matters for Canada. It is home to 4.3 billion people, or nearly 55% of the world's population. It has a middle class of 2 billion people, with 1.5 billion more expected in the next 10 years. Twenty-one out of 30 of the world's largest cities are in this region. Sixty per cent of global maritime trade comes through the South China Sea. This region is expected to account for over 50% of global GDP by 2040.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873017">Madam Chair, hello, <I>kwe</I>, <I>tansi</I>, <I>unusakut</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873018">I want to start this speech by acknowledging that we are here today on the unceded traditional territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people. I am pleased to be here with my colleagues today to discuss the 2021-22 supplementary estimates (B) for the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873019">Joining me today from the department is my deputy minister, Daniel Quan-Watson. He is not in the House with deputy Lucas, but he is here, in any event, in the corridors, passing me messages furiously as the case may be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873020">Having spent two years as Minister of Indigenous Services Canada, where we as a cabinet faced daily what is, let us hope, a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, I look forward to continuing this work as Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations. This department is at the forefront of Canada's efforts to re-establish a nation-to-nation, Inuit-Crown and government-to-government relationship between Canada, first nations, Inuit and Métis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873021">We are also changing the way we work within the department in partnership with indigenous peoples, in order to better support communities across the country as they assert their right to self-determination. This work is critical to building a new type of relationship with indigenous peoples based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873022">The 2021-22 supplementary estimates (B) include investments of over one billion dollars toward key initiatives that are priorities for our government. Of that amount, $973.9 million is for Crown-Indigenous relations and $57.5 million is attributed to Northern Affairs. The majority of these funds for Crown-Indigenous relations will be used to settle claims and litigation, to support infrastructure projects in indigenous communities, and to implement the federal pathway to address missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. We have made these areas a priority and have dedicated substantial resources to supporting them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873023">Resolving and settling claims that involve historic grievances of wrongs committed by the Crown is at the heart of our mandate, and as a department it is our goal to do so in a respectful manner and in equal partnership across the negotiating table. These claims need to be addressed for us to move forward together. They can often relate to lands that were appropriated by settlers and that hold sacred meaning for indigenous communities. Returning land is essential for communities to make their own plans according to their priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873024">Settling litigation outside the courts, especially class actions related to historic harms committed against indigenous children, is essential to address the legacy of colonial policies and the ongoing unwritten chapter in taking meaningful steps toward reconciliation with those who continue to feel the impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873025">Too many indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are still being harmed today, and we must continue to do everything we can to stop that now. We are accelerating the work with indigenous partners in provinces and territories to address this national tragedy. The federal pathway is our government's response to the final report of the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. It is also part of a national action plan launched this year with partners to address this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873026">The federal pathway is key to restoring a sense of justice for those who have been lost and have gone missing, for those who have survived, and for families and healing for communities. Our government will continue to work with partners on our collective way forward to address the root causes of missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. This includes strengthening relationships with indigenous partners and provincial and territorial governments to bring accountability to this work and accountability for the Government of Canada to uphold this role in Canadian society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873027">More especially in regard to the claims, the $412.2 million that is already allocated to the specific claims settlement fund will be reprofiled in 2022-23. This will ensure that these funds continue to be available for the payment of compensation to first nations under specific claims settlements while concluding the outstanding legal obligations of the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873028">As the pace of negotiations is directly defined by the priorities of each community and group, it is difficult to predict exactly when they will be completed, but it is the need of this government to accelerate things.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6873029">The fund was specifically set up with the flexibility to adapt to the evolving time frames of negotiations so that money not spent in a particular year can be moved to a future year, as needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873030">The supplementary estimates (B) also provide $211.2 million to support the Gottfriedson day scholar settlement. Through this settlement, Canada will provide $10,000 to each eligible survivor class member for the experience of attending a residential school during the day. This settlement includes a $50-million fund to the day school revitalization society, which will be a survivor-led organization focusing on healing, wellness, education, language, culture and commemoration activities. Funding sought will include administration and legal costs, obviously for the settlement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873031">The supplementary estimates (B) also include $3 million to support the government's ongoing commitment to resolving indigenous childhood claims litigation outside of the courts. The estimates this year provide $231.4 million of new funding for the distinctions-based indigenous community infrastructure fund announced in budget 2021. The goal of this fund is to contribute to the closing of the infrastructure gap in indigenous communities by 2030, along with other ministries tasked with closing that gap. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873032">This funding also aims to advance self-determination and self-governance, create good jobs and build healthier, safer and more prosperous indigenous communities. It will support the essential indigenous-led infrastructure and development needs specifically of Inuit, Métis, self-governing and modern treaty nations and northern indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873033">I am thankful for the opportunity to share the important work that Crown-Indigenous Relations carries out. What we are doing is important for so many indigenous communities across this country, from addressing the root causes of violence against indigenous women and girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people to settling land claims and closing infrastructure gaps. These activities will build stronger, safer and healthier indigenous communities from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873034">I look forward to answering any questions the House may have.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873044">Madam Chair, as the member can appreciate, this is not a question that can be answered in a very easy 30 seconds. Clearly, in the work we look at, we state that the relationship is defined by land, has been broken by land and is restituted by land. However, it is not easy to fix from the sole perspective of the federal government. It involves individuals, municipalities and provinces, especially divisions between provincial Crown land and federal Crown land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873045">Clearly there is work to be done squarely within this department to be a little more creative in how we settle claims. In some cases, where lands cannot be restituted, funds have to be given and appropriated in the proper fashion to communities.

That brings us up to about 120. Let us recall that there were a little over 100 in place when we came into power in 2015.

Obviously this is not my language. It is something I have had a lot of support in learning.

Restrictions on public gatherings made events and celebrations of heritage and culture impossible. Production shut down for many creative works.

To remain competitive and to ensure a more resilient, equitable and prosperous future, we must ensure that our path forward keeps 1.5°C in sight and aligns with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873270">Because the current biodiversity, climate and health crises are all interconnected, scientific research shows we must also ensure much more of our natural environment is protected. It is what science tells us we must do if we are to avoid the worst impacts of a changing climate. It is what Canadians expect us to do. The public will for doing more and moving faster has never been more clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873271">Working together with all residents of Canada to create the conditions that align our policies and actions toward these ambitions is one of the highest priorities of Environment and Climate Change Canada. We have enshrined our goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 into law and established an accountable and transparent process to get us there. We have also submitted Canada's enhanced nationally determined contribution with the target to reduce emissions by 40% to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030, reflecting both the scale of the climate challenges and the economic opportunity that climate action presents, and we are certainly making progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873272">We have a world-leading carbon pricing and rebate system, and one of the most detailed climate plans in the world. We have methane regulations for the oil and gas sector, regulations to accelerate the phase-out of coal and economy-wide standards for cleaner fuel. We are making record-level investments in public transit, electrification and nature-based solutions. In addition, we are investing in nature-based climate solutions; restoring and conserving ecosystems such as wetlands, peatlands and grasslands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873273">We are also working in partnership with indigenous peoples to achieve these ambitions, as their participation is key to meeting our target of conserving 25% of Canada's land and 25% of its oceans by 2025, and then working toward conserving 30% by 2030, as well as achieving our climate targets and net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873274">At COP26 last month, we made commitments to go even further. We committed to put in place a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector as well as committing to the transition to a net-zero electricity grid by 2035. There is no single, simple solution. Rather, all of these initiatives taken together have put us on track to meet our targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873275">There is still much more that needs to be done, which brings us to the supplementary estimates (B) for Environment and Climate Change Canada. The department's submission amounts to a net increase of $135.6 million, bringing its total authorities to $2 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873276"> From these funds, $105.2 million will be used to conserve Canada's land and fresh water, protect species, advance indigenous reconciliation and increase access to nature. These funds will help to implement the enhanced nature legacy initiative and respond to the biodiversity crisis and pressures for a sustainable recovery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873277">These also include an increase of $9.9 million to drive a whole-of-government implementation of Canada's strengthened climate plan and lead government-wide efforts to develop further climate actions to advance Canada's international priorities on environment and climate, as announced at COP26.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="05">(2205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6873278">It also takes into consideration $2.1 million for Canada's new marine conservation targets to meet Canada's target of protecting 25% of our oceans by 2025. The department's 2021-22 supplementary estimates (B) also seeks $6.5 million to implement a new, one-year “Our Healthy Environment and Economy” advertising campaign. This will help mobilize the full breadth of Canada's ingenuity and engage and inspire Canadians with a sense of confidence that, as a nation, we can do this. It includes $6.4 million to support the net-zero advisory body and the net-zero challenge to help companies develop plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873279">Finally, it includes $3.2 million to address imminent threats to the wood bison and $2.4 million to implement the Wood Buffalo National Park world heritage site action plan. I have actually spent time in the area near Fort Chipewyan, and I can tell members that in the Wood Buffalo National Park, the wood bison specifically is a species that we do not want to lose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873280">The Parks Canada Agency's protected areas and national historic places play a vital role in conserving natural and cultural heritage, fighting climate change and biodiversity loss, and providing Canadians with opportunities to learn more about iconic cultural and natural settings. As Canadians continue to do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19, we know that spending time in nature and outdoors offers important health and wellness benefits at a difficult time for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873281">Through the 2021-22 supplementary estimates (B), the Parks Canada Agency is seeking to increase its reference levels by $131.4 million. The majority of this amount, to a maximum of $71.7 million, will be available, if required, to support the agency for revenue losses from April 1, 2021, to September 30, 2021. These revenue shortfalls are mainly related to visitor service fees, sales of rights and permits, and sales of services for the first six months of the 2021-22 fiscal year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873282">This amount also includes a request for almost $47.5 million to conserve Canada's lands and fresh water, protect species, advance indigenous reconciliation and increase access to nature. Included is a request for an internal reallocation of $42.7 million to support the creation, expansion and designation of new national historic sites, national parks, national marine conservation areas and other protected heritage areas. As well, an additional $4.4 million in funding will support the implementation of the Wood Buffalo National Park world heritage site action plan. On top of this, the agency is also seeking through this funding just over $3.9 million to address imminent threats to wood bison. Finally, this funding request takes into consideration an ask for a little more than $3.6 million to implement Canada's new marine conservation targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873283"> All of these requests will go a long way in helping to ensure a cleaner, more resilient, equitable and prosperous future for all residents of Canada today and well into the future. I thank members of this House for their time, and I encourage all to support these estimates.</ParaText>

Tourism is a huge part of the Canadian economy, and it is an even bigger part of the economy in my riding of South Okanagan—West Kootenay. In Canada in normal years we welcome 22 million people, and three million of those visitors come to the Okanagan and the Kootenay area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873307">A lot of those tourism businesses have really been impacted over the last two years by the COVID pandemic. One of the groups that has been hit the hardest has been independent travel advisers. These are home-based sole proprietorships, and 85% of the business owners are women. Again, women have been hit hardest by the pandemic in terms of their work and their business opportunities, much more than men.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873308">Independent travel advisers are paid by commission under contract with travel agencies. They have a delay in pay of five to 12 months, because they get paid only when that travel actually happens. Lately, a lot of that travel just has not happened. These travel advisers were able to access CERB when it was available, but they were dropped like a hot potato recently when CERB ended. They are simply not eligible for any of the supports that are now being offered by the government, yet because of ongoing travel restrictions and delays at the border, as well as testing requirements, a lot of people just are not travelling. These businesses are really hurting. They are asking for an emergency funding program to bridge that gap until people start travelling again.</ParaText>

What they need is a bridge through this last toughest time. We are talking about entrepreneurs who lost 50% of their business. We are talking about entrepreneurs who simply could not continue to keep their staff employed because the demand was shut off because we closed the borders to keep Canadians safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873320">As I said at TIAC last week, safety first, then travel. What the tourism sector has asked us for is a bridge of supports to get through this winter into the spring. We have heard the appeals from independent travel agents and we will continue to work on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873321">We have gone to the wall for Canadians and for entrepreneurs in the tourism sector. We have put Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document> on the floor of this House. We ask for the support of members from all parties to get Bill C-2 passed so we can give our tourism sector, which touches every single riding represented in this chamber, the support and hope it needs to get through the winter into the spring and into Q3.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873323">There is another issue I have been hearing about from tourism-based operators in my riding, especially some of the ski resorts such as Big White and RED Mountain. These ski resorts hire primarily young international travellers who work in Canada on an international experience Canada visa. Sixty per cent of Big White's employees are in that category. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873324">These people were there working when the pandemic hit. In many cases, they could not leave to go home so they worked out their visa and now those visas have run out. New visa applications to bring new workers in have been stalled. Big White especially has contacted me saying that it expects good business this year but it has no employees. It is down 40% or more of the employees it needs, yet the visa applications are going nowhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873325">The ski areas are really desperate for these workers. What is the government doing to get these workers to Canada, where they can help our businesses thrive?</ParaText>

There are still some big gaps that could be easily fixed, yet the minister is just getting up and talking about the other stuff. That does not help these businesses that are going under.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873336">I want to switch now to the big issue facing tourism operators and many businesses in my riding and across the country. That is the labour shortage. In my riding, the big factor in the labour shortage is housing. In my riding the average income is $30,000 a year and the average house price is $900,000. It is one of the worst ratios in the country with that disparity between housing costs and wages. Workers come to the Okanagan and the Kootenays looking for work. There is lots of work but they cannot find any housing. They cannot find rental housing and they certainly cannot afford to buy a house.</ParaText>

We have been there with them through the pandemic. We will continue to be with them to the end of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873340">I will share three themes that we want to make sure we undertake as a government. We are going to continue with our partners from coast to coast to coast to lead. We are going to demonstrate leadership in the sector.

The Prime Minister was also unable to win concessions on agriculture, pipelines, threats to our auto industry and, really broadly, the U.S. administration's damaging buy American policies. This has raised serious questions about the ability of the government to negotiate with our closest ally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873346">American protectionism continues to be a threat to Canadian industry and puts jobs at risk in the Kenora riding, across northern Ontario and across the country. The U.S. is Canada's largest trading partner, and we need a government and Prime Minister who are able to ensure that our workers and industries are being treated fairly.</ParaText>

These people and their families need reassurance that the government has their backs, and they need concrete results to continue making a living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873348">Last week in question period, I pressed the government on its inability to work effectively with the U.S. and received a very unsatisfactory response from the <Affiliation DbId="278924" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. Frankly, it will reassure nobody in the Kenora riding or across northern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873349"> In response to other questions, including in the take-note debate that we had, the <Affiliation DbId="278924" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has been unable to tell the House how many negotiations the Liberals have had with the U.S. trade representative. They have been unable to really state broadly what their plan is to end this dispute. They have also been unable to talk about what retaliatory measures, if any, the government plans to take or what the path forward will be on rebuilding what is very clearly a damaged relationship with the U.S. administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873350">Previously in this chamber, the <Affiliation DbId="278924" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> said that the government has done a good job on the file, and I believe that just shows how truly disconnected the government is from what is going on on the ground.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873352">Madam Speaker, the softwood lumber industry is a priority for the Government of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873353">This industry is the economic backbone of many communities across the country and is a key part of Canada's forestry sector that contributed more than $25 billion to the GDP in 2020 and employed nearly 185,000 workers. We can be proud of our softwood lumber industry, and our government is a strong advocate for its interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873354">I must say that Canada is particularly disappointed that the United States decided to unfairly increase the tariffs it imposes on most Canadian softwood lumber producers. These unjust tariffs are hurting Canadian communities, businesses and workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873355">My colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="278924" Type="4">Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development</Affiliation>, was in Washington last week to meet with U.S. congressional leaders and stakeholders to advocate for Canadian interests and to raise issues of concern regarding softwood lumber. On November 18, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also spoke to the U.S. President about this matter. The <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> also laid out Canada's position in her meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State on November 12. Meanwhile, senior Canadian officials have been conveying this message to their American counterparts at every opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873356">I can assure the member that we are working tirelessly with the U.S. government to arrive at a positive solution to this conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873357">We remain convinced that a negotiated settlement is not only possible but in the best interests of both countries. As a Quebec minister, I am shocked that one of our businesses, Resolute Forest Products, is being charged combined duties that are higher than what other companies are being charged. That is just not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873358">Canada is asking the United States to stop charging these unfair and unjustified tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber products, but the United States has shown no interest in serious discussions to find a mutually acceptable solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873359">Finally, I wish to reiterate that the Government of Canada will continue to vigorously defend Canada's softwood lumber industry by seeking recourse under chapter 19 of NAFTA and chapter 10 of CUSMA and through the World Trade Organization.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873366">Madam Speaker, my riding of Vancouver East has the third largest urban indigenous community in the country. We also had the largest homeless encampment in this country. That encampment has now been taken down, but people are still homeless on the streets and I see tents everywhere. The winter months are here; it is wet and it is cold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873367">The most glaring omission from the national housing strategy was an urban, rural and northern “for indigenous, by indigenous” housing strategy. As the CHRA indigenous caucus pointed out, Canada’s distinctions-based indigenous housing strategy left a huge gap for 87% of indigenous peoples living off reserve and had called for the government to address this huge housing gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873368">The proposal for a fourth strategy calling for specific programs and investments for urban, rural and northern indigenous peoples backed by budget measures was supported unanimously by indigenous and non-indigenous members of the CHRA. That was back in 2018. Despite the Liberals saying that they are committed to a “for indigenous, by indigenous” urban indigenous housing strategy, we have yet to see one materialize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873369">Budget after budget, the Liberals failed to deliver. In response to budget 2021, Robert Byers, chair of CHRA indigenous caucus, said the absence of such a strategy in budget 2021 is a disgrace. Tim Richter, president and CEO of the CAEH, and co-chair of the government’s National Housing Council called it “the most glaring disappointment”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873370">In this throne speech, there was zero recognition of the need for a “for indigenous, by indigenous” urban, rural, northern housing strategy, despite the fact that the core housing need for indigenous households is the highest in Canada. The Northwest Territories is at 22.3%, Yukon at 24.1% and Nunavut is at 44.3%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873371">The Parliamentary Budget Officer most recently reported that 124,000 indigenous households are in core need, including 37,500 who are homeless in a given year. The annual affordability gap is $636 million. Winnipeg has the highest number of indigenous households in need of housing estimated at 9,000, and Vancouver is second at 6,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873372">We also know that indigenous peoples are 11 times more likely to use a homeless shelter. The latest point in count shows that 7,000 indigenous persons are in shelters or unsheltered across 61 communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873373">We need the government to stop with the talking points. It is time to take action. I am calling on the minister to include a “for indigenous, by indigenous” urban, rural and northern housing strategy and the creation of a national housing centre designed and run by indigenous housing providers in this fiscal update.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873374">It is absolutely essential for the government to take action. If the government seriously wants the community to believe that reconciliation is the top priority for the government, it needs to take action. I do not want to hear from the government members who get up to pat themselves on the back to say what a great job they are doing. They do not have to look far to know what I am saying is true. All they have to do is come to my riding in Vancouver East and I will take them down to the streets. They will see for themselves—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6873377">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="278710" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> for highlighting the deep and urgent levels of housing needs among indigenous peoples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873378">As the member noted, indigenous peoples are overrepresented among the homeless population. This is the case in virtually all of Canada's major cities. I can assure the member and all Canadians that we are fully committed to co-developing an urban, rural and northern indigenous housing strategy. This will include a national indigenous housing centre. With this centre, indigenous peoples will oversee federal indigenous housing programs once fully realized. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873379">In our discussions with first nations, Inuit and Métis partners, they have told us that they want a strategy that will advance reconciliation, a strategy that is for indigenous peoples and led by indigenous peoples. Our government agrees, and that is what is driving our work with our indigenous partners to develop this urban, rural and northern strategy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873380">Even as we work toward this strategy, we continue to respond to the deep and urgent needs for housing across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873381"> For example, we prioritized funding to indigenous peoples through the $2.5 billion rapid housing initiative. In fact, in the first round of this program, close to 40% of all units created under the rapid housing initiative will benefit indigenous peoples. We will soon be able to share news on the second round of this program, which will ultimately create at least 9,200 permanent, affordable homes for our most vulnerable populations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873382">We have also responded to the urgent need for more shelters and transitional and supportive housing for indigenous women and children fleeing gender-based violence. Earlier this month, our government announced more than $724 million to build and support the operation of at least 38 shelters in addition to 50 transitional homes across Canada, including in urban areas and the north. This follows the previous initiative we announced last June to build 12 shelters across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873383">In addition to these most recent investments, we continue to track strong progress through our national housing strategy programs. More than $72.5 billion in investments have been delivered through this strategy, and, as I said, we have prioritized indigenous and northern housing needs across all aspects of the national housing strategy. In addition to that, we have earmarked $638 million in specific funding to ensure indigenous peoples living in urban, rural and northern communities have better housing outcomes now and for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873384">We will continue to deepen and expand our investments in housing. In the recent Speech from the Throne, we have also announced plans for new programs that will be designed to give more access to housing wherever families are on the housing continuum. This includes a proposal to set up a $4 billion housing accelerator fund to help municipalities clear up development backlogs so that projects can get off the ground more quickly. It also includes a rent-to-own program that would give more families a chance to make their dream of home ownership a reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873385">This is an important part of our commitment and we will continue, as I said, to prioritize housing for indigenous peoples through the national housing strategy. In fact, it is through that lens that we make these investments. However, I agree with the hon. member that we have to make more progress to ensure we have a distinct urban, rural and northern indigenous housing strategy, and that can only be done with and led by indigenous peoples.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873386">Madam Speaker, I am sorry, but the fact is that the Liberal government has promised this for four years and it has not delivered. It is not even in the throne speech. He mentioned the need for a “for indigenous, by indigenous” urban, rural and northern housing strategy. The measures that the minister mentioned just now will not provide support to indigenous peoples in core need. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873387">If the minister truly believes in what he said just now, that the government is going to implement a “for indigenous, by indigenous” urban, rural and northern housing strategy along with a housing centre, will he advise that there will be commitments in the fiscal update coming up on December 14? The minister has to show action, not just talk about it. </ParaText>

The hon. member only has to look at the projects that have been approved through the first round of the rapid housing initiative. She can look at the fact that 38%, almost 40%, of all the successful projects under the rapid housing initiative went to indigenous people.</ParaText>

She chooses to ignore the fact that we are the government that has invested the most amount of money in affordable housing in the history of the Northwest Territories and unlocked federal dollars for the Yukon and Nunavut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873390">We will continue to do more, but absolutely we have made a lot of progress as well.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6873391">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be here at this very late hour to be granted an adjournment debate on the labour crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873392">The government's recent economic recovery speech said it was committed to leaving no worker or region behind, yet nowhere in the speech was there a single mention of the labour shortages that thousands of small and medium-sized businesses face. Leaving small businesses adrift is a roadblock to our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As the member of Parliament for Kelowna—Lake Country, my local businesses are feeling the crunch of not having the staffing levels necessary to offer their goods and services like they are used to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873393"> Jason Davis, who operates the Okanagan branch of a security company, told me that a significant drop in employee candidates has left the company running at a loss. They estimate losing over $100,000 in contractually guaranteed revenue because of lost staffing coverage. That is in addition to the hundreds of thousands more they have been forced to incur in penalties for not meeting contractual obligations, higher costs of recruitment and the inability to take on any new work. This is similar to stories I hear from many business owners. Working in security, they are able to see how labour shortages have been damaging to their sector and the many other businesses they work with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873394">However, employers like Jason are not coming to my office just to talk about difficulties. They are coming to me with solutions. He has suggestions on the temporary foreign worker program, and this side of the House has similarly looked at offering solutions to tackling this labour crisis. Along with the chairman of the Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association, I have already sent a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> asking him to extend working visas that have expired for people already in Canada. This is an easy fix, yet so far we have received no response and the government is silent. Ignoring our warnings on this labour crisis will not make the problem disappear. It will leave our recovery on the rocks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873395">Statistics Canada said that in September there were over one million job vacancies. During that same month, there were about a million people on the CRB. RBC Economics reported that one in every three businesses is grappling with labour shortages. A report from the government's own Business Development Bank says that 55% of entrepreneurs struggle to hire the workers they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873396">We do not have to let this country run into a growing iceberg. We can choose to take action to ensure our recovery lifts up all businesses and workers. We can ensure that Canadians continue to be employed at good-paying jobs that support their communities with affordable goods and services. We need to get people who are able to work back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873397">We can keep Canadians spending at small businesses by tackling skyrocketing inflation, which is escalating gas and grocery bills. We can strengthen our supply chains by ensuring Canadian warehouses, ports and trucking companies have the staff to meet their needs. We can address the increasing debt that small businesses are currently carrying, with an average of $170,000 in new debt. We can address rising costs for small businesses by halting federal payroll tax increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873398">I urge the government to take note of these and the many more ideas expressed by my colleagues across partisan divides. Rushed legislation like Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document> will not solve staffing shortages. I ask the government to work collaboratively in the House to tackle the growing labour shortage threats that are crippling small business and impeding our economic recovery.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873399">Madam Speaker, I know the hon. member's riding very well, having spent a lot of time there as a business person before entering politics, and from training for an Ironman triathlon in the region, which feels like it was almost half a lifetime ago. It was certainly back in the days when I had more hair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873400">Moving on to other things, the member opposite raises an important issue. It is a whole-of-government preoccupation for us. I have had conversations with the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> on this. I think if we can set the table with 106% of jobs recovered since the lowest point in the pandemic, 154,000 jobs reported as added to the Canadian economy in the last month, and all of the hours that were lost during the pandemic having also been recovered. Those are important elements to put on the table as we get into the matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873401">There is no more important economic policy for Canada today than finishing the fight against COVID. That also impacts who we are able to bring here and how we are able to address the labour shortage. I think Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document> is an important piece of this puzzle, because it contains targeted business and income supports, including the emergency lockdown supports we need to fight omicron. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873402">If we take a step back and look at when the crisis hit, our government rapidly rolled out a full range of effective broad-based programs to support Canadians through our greatest economic shock as a country since the Great Depression. These actions were necessary and unprecedented in our lifetime.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873403">All across the country, these programs have been lifelines for workers and businesses. They protected millions of jobs and hundreds of thousands of Canadian businesses through the worst of the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873404">However, those emergency measures were always meant to be around just long enough to help people get through the crisis. Fortunately, we are now moving into a new phase that promises to be very different from the dark days of our fight against COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6873405">Thanks to one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, most businesses are safely reopening and employment is now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873406">We know there are still workers and businesses whose livelihoods are being affected as a result of pandemic-related restrictions on their activity. That is why it is important to pivot to our support measures. It is a move to more targeted measures, which will provide help where it is needed most and continue to create jobs and growth while prudently managing government spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873407">Some may wonder how we can tell when we have reached a turning point in Canada's economic recovery from the COVID recession. Allow me to highlight the markers of our government's successful economic response plan, which have brought us to where we are today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873408">In last year's throne speech, our government promised to create one million jobs, a goal we achieved in September of this year when Canada recovered all of the jobs lost at the lowest point of the COVID-19 recession.

              <ParaText id="6873411">Madam Speaker, let me again remind the government why small business labour shortages in our economy matter. Small businesses represent about 70% of Canadians employed in the private sector. Out of every 20 businesses employing Canadians, 19 are small businesses. They are the greatest driver of innovation and prosperity in this country and are the ground level for our economic success. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873412">Statistics Canada's most recent survey of business conditions shows more than one in four businesses expect its profitability to decline by the end of the year. The government's inaction on this labour crisis will only cause more stress to entrepreneurs working longer hours and more businesses folding in the new year. Keeping Canadians employed in good-paying jobs should be an essential priority for the government, but without a small business sector that is thriving, not just barely surviving, those jobs will not be there to go back to.</ParaText>
