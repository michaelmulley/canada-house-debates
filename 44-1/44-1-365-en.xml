            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8668917"> Mr. Speaker, right before we concluded on Friday, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278558" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation> asked me a question about the Conservatives' dollar-for-dollar rule. It is a question I am very pleased to address because the Conservatives believe we need to fix the budget. That means when a new spending commitment is made, we need to be able to identify where the money will come from. This is unlike the Liberals, who continually make new spending commitments and have no plan for where to get the money for them, other than through higher taxes and higher inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668918">The Conservatives, when we have made announcements, have been clear about where the money would come from. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278558" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation> was asking in general, for some of these proposals, where the money would come from. I will shed some more light on some of the key areas. We have seen a dramatic increase in spending on outside consultants providing advice to the government that could be provided by the public service. We have seen incredible abuses in the procurement system. One of many areas where we can very easily save money is in outside consulting and procurement, by ending all of the abuse we have seen there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668919"> Mr. Speaker, I am really glad my colleague talked about outsourcing and highly paid consultants, something the NDP has been deeply concerned about dating back to the Harper government. Outsourcing doubled under the Harper government. It has actually quadrupled under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668920">One thing we have been trying to do as New Democrats is take a real look at companies like Deloitte, for example. It is the highest paid beneficiary in all of external consulting. The Conservatives, who run the government operations committee through the chair and their members, have not allowed OGGO to study and take a close examination of Deloitte despite many requests by the New Democrats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668921">It is no surprise that the Liberals do not want to look at it, but I will note that former cabinet minister Pierre Pettigrew and former Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay sit as managing directors of Deloitte. It is no surprise why the Conservatives do not want to take up a closer examination of Deloitte. They want to talk about McKinsey in their rabbit hole chase, but they do not want to look at Deloitte.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668922">Will my colleague tell us when the Conservatives are going to open up the books on Deloitte and take a hard look at it? Why is Deloitte getting such an obscene number of outsourced contracts from Canadian taxpayers?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668923">Mr. Speaker, in broad strokes, the member's description of the OGGO committee's agenda is simply incorrect. I know he has not been a member of OGGO for a very long time, but I understand he may be back. I look forward to giving him the opportunity to get reacquainted with the committee's agenda and working with him again at that point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668924">Here is what happened with respect to the studies on outsourcing for McKinsey, Deloitte and other companies. The committee ordered various documents related to the outsourcing to McKinsey. We wanted to pursue the government on those documents because the documents we ordered were not provided. However, the NDP folded like a cheap suit and would not work with us to demand that we get those documents. On the one hand, the NDP refused to follow up to get the documents, but on the other hand, it tried to shift us over to another company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668925">The Conservatives would say, no, let us do the work; let us look at every instance of outsourcing, but let us get the documents we asked for. We cannot say we do not need these documents and then jump to something else right when we are in the middle of pursuing one particular issue. The NDP should stand with us in ordering the production of these documents. Then we can get the work done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668928">Mr. Speaker, in terms of the future of this Parliament, I believe it is time now for a carbon tax election. It is time to put to Canadians what we have put forward, our proposal to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime, as well as the Liberal government's record of failure over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668929"> Right now, the Liberals have refused to hand over documents that Parliament has ordered. This is why there is a focus on this question of privilege. We are stuck on this question of privilege because the Liberals refuse to hand over documents that the House has ordered. This could end right away if the government would hand over the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668930">Moreover, as we have seen, the green slush fund demonstrates the cost, the corruption and the crime that have been growing in this country over the last nine years. With costs up, crime up and time up, we should go to a carbon tax election now and have a Conservative government that will really get things done in this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668932">I would like to remind my colleagues of something rather important. The opposition parties agree with this motion and the Bloc Québécois is prepared to vote in favour of it. If we adopt it again, the government will have no choice but to hand over the documents. Right now we are caught in a sort of vicious circle, like the chicken-and-egg dilemma. Members want the government to hand over the documents to put an end to the debate, but at the same time, we know we are winning the debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668933">When will we vote on this motion? If my colleague cannot answer that question, can he tell me how many more Conservative members will rise to speak on this issue so that we can mentally prepare? Is this debate going to go on until Christmas?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8668934">Mr. Speaker, let me seize on the idiom the member used. What is going to come first, the chicken or the egg: the study proposed at committee or getting the documents? The chicken needs to lay the egg, that is, the documents are needed first, and then the study can be done. If we send this to a committee without having the documents, the committee will be severely limited in the work it can do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668935">It is an established principle that Parliament has a right to order the production of documents. We are prepared for this privilege question to end right away, today, in five minutes, if the government hands over the documents. For the public accounts committee and other committees that have been studying this issue to properly do the work, the government needs to be responsive and forthcoming in adhering to what Parliament has asked for. In this case, that means documents that the law clerk can provide to the RCMP and allowing committees to proceed with the work they need to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668936">It is very clear where we are right now. As soon as the government hands over these documents, we can proceed to other business. The government has refused to recognize the long, well-established privileges of Parliament and the principle of parliamentary sovereignty in our system of government. By the way, the government has failed to recognize that principle on a broad host of other cases as well. Starting with the Winnipeg labs documents and in many cases since, the Liberals have failed to show respect for this institution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668940">Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether the member opposite has a security clearance, but let us talk about how we got here. All of the opposition parties voted to order the production of these documents. Parliament is sovereign. A majority of members of Parliament voted to order these documents. The member, representing a minority of the House, does not like the decision the House has made, and that is fair enough; I do not always like decisions the House makes either. However, the House has ordered the production of these documents, and the government should recognize the supremacy of Parliament in our system of government.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8668941"> Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in the House on behalf of the constituents of Simcoe North. It is nice to see you in the chair. Usually, that is not the case when I am speaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668942"> Before I get into the heart of the matter, I would like to acknowledge a local benefactor in Simcoe North, who, over the summer, announced that he was donating $22.5 million to local charities in the region, in Simcoe County but primarily in Simcoe North. This is on top of $28 million that this individual has donated over the previous 27 years. This is likely the largest single benefactor in our area, a wonderful immigrant entrepreneur who came to the country with very little, built a business and has given back to the community. He could have stopped at any of the small towns along the 401 before he turned north to the Midland and Penetanguishene area, and we are very glad and lucky that he chose our place as home. On behalf of all the charities and recipients, I would like to thank Mr. Reinhart Weber for his generosity and amazing business success, which he has allowed to benefit the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668943"> We are back at it. I am wearing a green tie today not because I used to work for the former finance minister Jim Flaherty, but because it is the colour of money and the colour of the green slush fund. Somehow, we are still in this twilight zone. It feels a bit like the movie <I>Groundhog Day</I>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668944">In a letter the law clerk wrote with respect to Parliament's ability to receive the documents in question, he noted that the order is an exercise of the House of Commons' power to send for documents and that this parliamentary privilege is rooted in the preamble of the Constitution and section 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act. Nowhere in the motion does the House pretend to direct the RCMP. It merely says that these documents need to be made available to the RCMP. If the RCMP decides not to look at them, that is fine. If the RCMP, on recommendations from the justice department, says that some of these documents are inadmissible, that would be up to the RCMP to decide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668945">Let us remember that this is not the first time the RCMP has not been able to get documents. Need I remind my hon. colleagues of SNC-Lavalin, the WE scandal and foreign interference? By the way, with respect to foreign interference, for the entire time this debate has occurred in the House, individuals within the government, who have had all the information all the way along, have said, “There is nothing to see here so please move along.” That is biggest understatement we have seen coming out of the government with respect to foreign interference. Lo and behold, there was explosive testimony at the public inquiry that the government did not want to have. Need I remind the House about the Winnipeg lab documents?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668946">This is a very serious matter. There are Criminal Code provisions related to breach of trust that ought to be explored by the RCMP. It is up to the RCMP to do so, but we want to make sure that it has the information to conduct an investigation if it chooses to do so. However, this raises a bigger question about the role of the House and the fact that the government, members of the government in particular, seems to consider this chamber, Parliament and committees mere inconveniences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668947">Let us go back to 2020, in the early days of the pandemic. What did the government try to do? The government tried to introduce legislation to give itself unlimited taxing and spending powers without having Parliament sit for oversight. We have ministers who routinely ignore invitations to come to committee. The Liberals frustrated the WE scandal. In fact, they prorogued Parliament to avoid that scandal. They took the Speaker's office to court. This was all in the name of protecting charter rights, and it is apparently why the Liberals are not giving the documents here. Well, what about the charter rights of the people who had their bank accounts frozen for what appeared to be charges of public mischief? However, here, the government wants to protect the privacy rights of people who may have defrauded the Canadian taxpayer and the Canadian public of significant money.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8668948"> Now let us go back to why. The Auditor General has said there is $400 million from this fund that has gone to ineligible recipients, including well over 100 specific instances of conflicts of interest. That alone should cause this entire place to stop until we figure out more and until we ensure that Canadian taxpayers will be taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668949"> I just saw last week one of the individuals who is at the heart of this scandal appear at industry committee. This individual said that she was under scrutiny because she was a woman and from Quebec. At no point during the testimony did I hear the words, “I am sorry; I made a mistake; I should have been more clear or more precise about recusing myself on the grounds of conflict of interest.” That is the definition of gaslighting, to try to shield oneself from scrutiny when they have been caught dead to rights by the Auditor General for misappropriating funds to companies in which that individual and other individuals on the board have a direct pecuniary financial interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668950">Now, I am here as an individual, and I would like to think we can be collaborative, so I have an idea. I will work hard to convince my colleagues that maybe there is another way. Maybe there is another path to get back to the people's work. Of course, the government could produce the documents, but maybe there is another way. If the government recovers the $400 million, I will work hard to convince my colleagues that maybe we should move past this and get back to the people's work, but I do not think the government has shown any interest in recovering these funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668951">The government was dragged kicking and screaming to do an internal investigation. When it had documents that specifically showed direct conflicts of interest, it waited until the Auditor General's report was done to ask some of these individuals to leave their posts. In fact, when it was known that there were problems with conflicts of interest with this particular fund, one of these board members was given a promotion. This person was promoted to the Canada Infrastructure Bank board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668952">I wonder if that individual had any personal connection to companies involved in the infrastructure space while they were there. It is a very relevant question to ask, but the fact is that this person sat on that board for multiple months. My understanding is that even a year after allegations surfaced of wrongful conduct, the government left this individual in that position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668953"> The government and other members in this House like to bring up scandals of the past. The one they like to bring up involved Mike Duffy, and for the life of me, I do not understand why. It was the only scandal in Canadian history where the taxpayer was repaid. Really, $90,000 was repaid to the taxpayer for wrongful conduct of a senator. He was in the wrong, but the taxpayer was made whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668954">As such, how come this government is not out trying to recover $400 million from people who should not have gotten it? If these documents were provided to this chamber, to the law clerk and to members of Parliament, there would be nothing to stop any member of Parliament from publishing these documents on their website or making them available to journalists. Of course, the RCMP would be able to look at those anyway. The fact that the documents would be sent to the RCMP is completely redundant. They will become public documents in most circumstances. It seems rather bizarre that this government is very happy not having much happen in this place, because it could easily just turn over the documents or maybe it should show some effort to recover the $400 million. As I said before, there is nothing in this motion that directs the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8668955"> I find it fascinating that members of the government, including the parliamentary secretary who is probably still smarting from the last time we had an exchange in this place, are worried about directing the RCMP. They improperly directed their attorney general on SNC-Lavalin and they improperly directed the RCMP with respect to releasing documents during an open and active investigation in the absolutely tragic Nova Scotia shooting, which was still very raw for the country, but more importantly for the victims of those crimes, all to politically benefit the government's new firearms regulations and agenda. They improperly pressured the commissioner of the RCMP to release details against protocols, because it would help the government's agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668956">I think that if this government was really worried about directing the RCMP, it would read the motion, for one, and recognize that the words “direct” or “encourage” or anything close to that are not there. As I said before, if these documents are produced, the RCMP will be able to get them on multiple avenues. The fact that they might be inadmissible to court has nothing to do with the motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668957">The Liberals think that they are protecting the charter rights of people who may have committed crimes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668960">However, if the RCMP had access to documents that might be inadmissible, it could at least put together a timeline of events and it could put together what has occurred. The fact that the Liberals are not interested in learning about the wrongdoings of board members that they appointed tells us all we need to know, which is that when this government started appointing board members to this organization, its lobbyists and friends, its eyes turned as green as the colour of my tie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668961">The SDTC organization had been going on for years without any problems. If we go back to the previous government, Jim Balsillie was the chair of that board and never put in an expense report. There was never an Auditor General concern about that organization or the way it disbursed funds. It was only when this government decided to appoint its friends, knowing they would be in conflict of interest. Thank God for the whistle-blower who let everybody know, before these appointments were made, that certain individuals would find it very hard to do their duty because they would be in so many conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668962">What was the response back to that initial concern? It was, “Do not worry about it, we have it taken care of.” Well, “have it taken care” of is right, with $400 million all the way to the bank. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668963">If Canadians are upset that Parliament is not working, they only need to look at one party. This motion, this request, is within the full rights of Parliament to make. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668964"> This makes it right because Parliament has asked for it. In the past there have been multiple times when Parliament has asked for documents in previous administrations. Do colleagues know what other governments have done? They have found another way to get past the impasse. During a very difficult and controversial issue with respect to treatment of detainees in a previous government, a secret committee was struck in order to allow members of Parliament to see sensitive documents related to national security. I do not see any creativity on that side of the House trying to find a path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668965"> If the government was interested in getting back to work, it would try to find a way to get back to work. As I mentioned before, I would be willing to work with that side of the House, to find a path to get this place back to work. That could include turning over the documents, but of course we see that the government is not that interested in doing that. Maybe if the government recovered the $400 million, we could move along and let this go to a committee where there would be full scrutiny, but only if taxpayers are repaid. To me, that would sound like a very reasonable compromise. I would commit to working with my colleagues in order to make that happen. If the government is unwilling or unable to even get a significant portion of those $400 million in funds returned, I think we might as well stay here for a very long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668966">I noted the question from my friend from the Bloc to the previous speaker about how long might this go on. I think we should try to find a compromise, but it has to include either the release of the documents or a full accounting and repayment of the $400 million back to the taxpayer. The $400 million is not a number that opposition party members have said was misappropriated or went to ineligible recipients. That number came from the Auditor General. We could have no more credible source when looking at government spending than the Auditor General. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668967">By the way, this would not be the first time that the government has not accepted the findings of the Auditor General. In a very rare case, the Auditor General produced a report on the CERB and wage subsidy audits that the government did not even accept. It was one of the first times in at least a decade where the findings of the Auditor General were not accepted. However, here I have not heard that the government has not accepted these findings. It seems bizarre that it is not also trying to recover the $400 million for taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668968"> I think we have established that Parliament has a right to these documents; taxpayers have a right to be repaid; there needs to be transparency; and the RCMP, to the extent that it wishes to look at the documents, should be able to look at them. As for the fact that the clerk might make them available to the RCMP or send them along, I do not think that should be of concern to anybody here, because once the documents are tabled, they are basically public anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668969">Unless the government wants to come up with another way, I think we are going to be here for a little while. I am fully confident that when we talk about the severity and the size of the grift in this circumstance of $400 million, it should bring this place to a halt. It should make a government think twice about how it is going to proceed. The fact that multiple opposition parties support this motion should let everybody know that $400 million, this entire circumstance, is that important that this place is coming to a halt until we get the documents. Release the papers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8668994">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise again in the House. It has been over a month that the House of Commons has been paralyzed. The Liberals are not able to advance a single piece of legislation in the House; quite frankly, I am not complaining about that part, after the last nine years and a lot of things they have done. The number one question that remains in my mind as I begin my comments today is this: What are they hiding? What damning information about their unethical conduct, when it comes to the $400-million green slush fund, is so bad they are willing to shut down the regular business of Parliament to avoid the RCMP having all of the documents, unredacted, so it can complete a criminal investigation into the Liberal government's green slush fund?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668995">I am speaking again and we are refusing to back down to the Liberals' demand that we push this over to a parliamentary committee to study and think about it, not to hand the documents over but to debate whether they have to or not. It makes one wonder why they are willing to give up a month of time for their own agenda to hide and cover up from the RCMP getting full access to vet all the documents. It is important to remind Canadians, as Conservatives have been doing, of the magnitude and severity of the unethical and inappropriate behaviour and use of taxpayers' money that the Liberal-appointed insiders gave themselves with this fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668996">The Auditor General, whose office is independent of the work we do in the House of Commons, came out with a stunning report. This was the first report, because there was a second, more in-depth report, that was required for Canadians to understand just how corrupt this program was. The report found that $59 million of this program was awarded to projects and companies that were ineligible to receive it. The worst part of all of this was the 186 cases where conflicts of interest existed. What do we mean by that? That comes to $330 million in funds awarded in cases where directors, appointed by the Liberals to this green slush fund board, who were approving their own projects, were not recusing themselves and were giving to themselves or to other directors' projects, 186 times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8668997">Here is the thing: This is a problem of the current Liberal government, which has been propped up by the NDP for several years since we have known about this behaviour and corruption. This is a Liberal-induced problem.</ParaText>

The program operated under a Liberal government and under nine years of a Conservative government, during which time the Auditor General found no such shoddy business and corruption. It was only in 2017, when the current Liberal government started changing the chair and appointing its own members to the board, that these serious problems and the misuse of taxpayer money started. </ParaText>

They got themselves in an incestuous circle of Liberal insiders, and they did it 186 times, for 330 million dollars' worth of projects approved where this was there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669005">We can go through the Auditor General's report; it lists the cases in exhibit 6.4. Exhibit 6.4 goes through the 90 cases of conflict of interest. In this case, and as part of it here, it is worth $76 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669006">March 29, 2021, was a pretty busy day at that board. It was not just one conflict of interest here or there. The chair, Annette Verschuren, voted to approve $100,000 with a conflict of interest on that meeting date. There is another one on the same day, where she was on another company and gave it $100,000. In the same meeting, NPower, another company, got seed money of $100,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669007">On March 10, 2022, a board member on the green slush fund, who also had a company in a conflict of interest, voted to give his company $5 million of taxpayers' money. There are 90 examples that go through the magnitude of the conflicts of interest and the corruption. I make the argument here that Canadians are rightly frustrated. This is not accidental. This is not some sort of circumstance where, whoops, they did not know the rules. They knew exactly what they were doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669008">I am drawing my opinion here in the chamber. What has the House said? A majority of members said, earlier this year, through a motion, that the RCMP must have all the documents, unredacted. At the end of the day, they do not get into a case where, based on the information we have and were given, we determined X. The majority of the House said to make sure, to not give an implication or an opinion and to give it the documents for it to do its full criminal investigation, something it confirmed is under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669009">Why is this important? For many reasons, it is just a simple matter of fact: All the information must be given for a full investigation; no stone must be left unturned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669010">Let us go back and remember the Liberal government and its record from just a couple of years ago. On the SNC-Lavalin scandal the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> found himself in, it was the RCMP saying that, based on the information it had, it would not proceed to lay charges. It is interesting.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669011">They were not given all the information. Cabinet confidants and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> blocked certain information from going to the RCMP for a full investigation. We can talk about a conflict of interest there. Parliament has the right to pass the motion, to have it enforced and to have the government comply with it. Parliament reigns supreme and is paramount, and the Speaker's ruling made exactly that clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669012">Liberals have tried to change their excuse over the course of the last month about five times, throwing whatever they can at the wall and hoping an argument sticks. Nothing has yet. Canadians want the RCMP to have the full information and to do a full criminal investigation. We do not want another conclusion such as that we had only a couple of years ago under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, when the RCMP did not have the information it needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669013">Another part that is important here is actually talking about that past pattern of behaviour. We talk about ethics violations, bad behaviour, not following the rules and only admitting fault after they are caught and found guilty of those ethics violations. There have been several in the past nine years under the government. The <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> was found in violation of ethics laws. A couple of years ago, the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> was as well. Just last week, the Liberal-appointed CBC president was found guilty of breaking ethics laws and fined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669014">We can believe it or not and say it is not so, but who is the one leading the pack? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself was found guilty of breaking ethics laws twice. There is a pattern of behaviour that Canadians are getting tired of. When the government came in, back in 2015, it was “open by default” and would have “sunny ways”. It was going to change the way things were done in Ottawa. It changed them, all right, and not for the better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669015">Liberals are so desperate to avoid accountability and transparency, to avoid complying with what the majority of the House of Commons has said, which to give up all the documents for a full criminal investigation, where no stone is left unturned. They are now so closed by default that they are closing their own business for the last month to avoid all of this. Again, we talk about a pattern of behaviour. A key thing for a government is maintaining trust with Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669016">I have spoken about the SNC-Lavalin scandal. The WE Charity scandal was another massive ethical challenge and corruption issue, with Liberals working with Liberal insiders to benefit them. At the time, they said it was all about youth during the pandemic. However, it was all about benefiting their friends, and they were caught for that. They talked about “open by default” but then did not follow through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669017">For the Winnipeg lab documents, there was a Speaker's ruling as well: Over years and years, the government refused to provide full access to all documents so that Canadians can see exactly what the government knew when it knew it and, in the case of what we know, what it did not do to protect our national security and the Canadian people. Again, this broke trust in a major way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669018">Now, Liberals are advancing and trying to keep the NDP-Liberal coalition alive. We found this out last week, when it was revealed that the NDP was given special access to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and Privy Council Office, in proposing a bill to change Canada's elections laws. The bill is not about adding advance poll dates. It is not about closing loopholes and foreign interference; gaps still exist. It is about moving back the election date by just a week. It so just happens that many NDP and Liberal MPs, who will lose their pension by a day, will have their pension guaranteed. They know they are going to be defeated in the next election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669019">It is on record. The NDP said that the legislation was part of its deal to keep the coalition intact. It was not to keep it intact because Canadians want it to do that. It was the opposite. It is desperate to avoid Canadians having their say in a carbon tax election. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669026">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your intervention to bring some order during my speech here. However, the interventions and the heckling do not bother me; they reinforce just how tired and out of gas the Liberals are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669027"> The Liberals changed the date for the election, which is absolutely ridiculous. They changed it to secure power in the votes of the NDP to keep them in office and avoid having to go to an election. That is the fact. They are sputtering, trying to explain and failing miserably at it. Therefore, those heckles do not discourage me; they reinforce the fact that the Liberals are desperately trying to change the channel from the numerous scandals that consume them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669028">I would be rattled too if I had to go to people in Kingston, having been a Liberal MP for the last nine years, and answer for the number of ethical violations that the Liberals have. He should answer for why they will not show the $400-million corruption scandal and provide all the documents to the RCMP, as well as why they are so desperate that they will work with the NDP to protect the pensions of soon-to-be defeated NDP and Liberal MPs. I am very confident in going to the people of Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669029">Again, the eroding trust is disgusting. There is very little left after nine years. Every week, Canadians are growing sick and tired of the endless desperation of Liberal and NDP MPs. Therefore, I do not worry about anything else but having an election right now for Canadians to have their say, which they desperately want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669030">On the other side, those members should be ashamed and embarrassed of what was exposed last week. They gave the NDP special, secret access to meetings in advance of proposing a bill to change the election laws in order to keep themselves in power. They got caught, and they should rightly be embarrassed and rattled about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669031">When we go back, at the end of the day, this issue happened because Liberals are terrible managers when it comes to the federal government. Again, this is the latest scandal of waste, mismanagement and corruption. I could go on for hours on end, outlining the numerous examples. There are the Auditor General reports that have come in the last couple of years alone, as well as the ones at public accounts and other committees that are under way and getting more information on the magnitude and depth of their incompetence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669032">The $400 million was meant for green technology, which are good buzz words from Liberals. We talk about virtue signalling. Why is that? It is because they say all the right things; they get A for announcements, but there is zero depth to the reality and their ability to deliver. The only thing they have delivered is 186 cases of conflict of interest totalling $330 million to Liberal insiders and giving $59 million to ineligible projects. It is not about green technology, the environment or Canadians. It is about lining the pockets of their friends. Twenty years ago, this defeated the last Liberal government, and it is going to be one of the many factors that defeat this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669033">In nine years, the NDP-Liberal government doubled the amount spent on consultants and outside contractors. It is going to $21 billion a year. We are seeing numerous cases, such as $60 million for ArriveCAN and $400 million here, of a completely inappropriate use of taxpayers' money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669034">As I wrap up my comments, I want Canadians to reflect on this: The Liberals have been made aware now, since whistle-blowers came forward a couple of years ago, of the case of the green slush fund. If they took this issue seriously, they would not have shut Parliament down for the last month to avoid accountability. They would not be dithering and delaying instead of just co-operating. If they are so serious about respecting taxpayers' money, they should tell us this: How much money has been returned of the $400 million to date? It is zero dollars, and that is why they have zero credibility left in the House. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669057">There is an eerie resemblance to the last nine years in what we have seen right here: a lack of transparency, a lack of respect for Canadians and an unwillingness for the democratic process, both in the motion that has been debated here and in the contempt that the government has been found in on the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling.

We will be here in the chamber until that is accomplished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669066"> In my first intervention in speaking to the amendment, I described the government's plethora of scandals. It is a list, a plethora or an amount; pick any word to describe the scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669067">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Cornucopia.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Dave Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, “cornucopia” is another good one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669069">I asked where the accountability is. Indeed, the witnesses should be compelled to come before the committee to provide Canadians with the documents and the answers they seek. Since my first intervention, I have not gotten a satisfactory response to the question I asked: Where is the accountability? I will therefore continue along in the similar line of questioning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669070">In the case of the green slush fund, $400 million was paid out to Liberal insiders. The bigger mind-boggling number to me is that it was through 186 cases of conflicts of interest, a number that came from a sampling by the Auditor General. I wonder how many Canadian families could be fed with $400 million. It is hard to wrap one's head around a number so big, and around so much corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669071"> According to another member's intervention in this place, $400 million is equivalent to the annual tax filings of 22,000 Canadian families, all to go to fund Liberal insider corruption. According to a recent RBC study, the average Canadian family of four now spends $1,227 a month on food, just under $15,000 a year. The math would suggest that $400 million would feed over 27,000 families per year, which is about 108,843 Canadians. Please do not misunderstand me. The role of government is to create the fiscal and societal climate where powerful paycheques allow Canadians to feed themselves; it should not have to be the role of government to directly feed Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669072"> Members get my point. I am trying to make the big numbers, which are so hard for many of us to wrap our heads around, relatable in order to indicate exactly the size of the issue we are dealing with and the amount of the gross misuse of taxpayer money. It is simply not acceptable. Where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669073">In speaking for 20 minutes two weeks ago, I did not have enough time to go through the full list of scandals, corruptions and conflicts of interest. I will continue in that vein today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669074">I did comment last time on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s removal of the only indigenous woman ever to serve as a justice minister and Attorney General for Canada, Jody Wilson-Raybould. She was removed because she would not be pressured by him to thwart the rule of law in Canada to help the PM's friends at SNC-Lavalin. The former minister lost her job because she stood up for what her oath of office required her to do. She was accountable, which is the principle that everyone is subject to the law, regardless of their relationship with the Prime Minister of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669075">I also spoke about one of several Bill Morneau scandals, including Bill <Document DbId="8502232" Type="3">C-27</Document>. When the bill was tabled in the House of Commons, the value of Morneau Shepell shares increased dramatically. Coincidentally, Minister Morneau held 21 million dollars' worth of shares.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669076"> I also mentioned the David Lametti scandal, yet another case of Liberal disregard for the rule of law in Canada. The former attorney general cancelled the verdict of first-degree murder against Jacques Delisle, a former judge, even though all the legal experts were against this decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669077">Who can forget the then minister of public works, whose husband sat on LifeLabs board as a director while the company was awarded COVID testing contracts totalling $68.2 million? What is the value of that in today's groceries? It could feed 18,470 plus people. Again I ask, where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669078"> I mentioned Scott Brison's attempt to benefit from his and his husband's ties to Irving Shipbuilding by trying to block a shipyard contract in favour of Irving away from Davie. In the process, the Liberals and Mr. Brison tried to frame multi-decorated Vice-Admiral Mark Norman and charge him with breach of trust. He was exonerated of all those charges, but not before his military career was destroyed. The whole sordid affair was unconscionable. Where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669079"> Former minister Navdeep Bains was also mentioned in my previous speech with his telecom windfall. As the former minister of innovation, science and industry, he pledged to deliver government support and that they would demand the big three telecoms, which are Bell, Rogers and Telus, to lower their prices by 25%. Now, Mr. Bains sits as the chief corporate affairs officer at Rogers and is receiving a six-figure salary. Again, there is no accountability, and for Canadians, there are higher cell phone bills. In many cases, Canadians' mobile data plans cost 200 times more than the cheapest ones in other countries, according to a recent Toronto Star report. I do not know about other members' cell phone bills, but mine has not gone down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669080">Of course, no scandal chronicle would be complete without mention of the WE Charity scandal and the Trudeau family bonanza paydays totalling $482,000. Doing the math, that amount would buy 128 Canadians groceries for a year. I guess that is okay because I am sure Margaret, Sacha and Sophie needed the money for groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669081"> I would have been negligent in my previous intervention if I had not touched upon the notorious arrive scam and GC Strategies incident. That was the Liberal-friendly company that charged $60 million for an app that could have cost $80,000. Again, there is not much accountability. If my calculator is correct, that would be the equivalent of groceries for 16,300 Canadians for an entire year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669082"> What about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Christmas vacation on the Aga Khan's island and the subsequent $50 million of federal funding that flowed to that foundation, which is what it has received since 2016?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669083"> The Prime Minister also invited a convicted terrorist, Jaspal Atwal to dinner when he was in India with his family, and he ensured the feast was prepared by his own celebrity chef, who was flown in from Vancouver. He embarrassingly played Mr. Dressup with an insensitive overuse of Indian clothing. That scandal cost Canadians another $1.66 million, or the equivalent of the annual food bill for 451 Canadians. There was no accountability for that fiasco. Once again, Canadians were left embarrassed and angry, or perhaps hangry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669084"> The Ethics Commissioner found that the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development</Affiliation> also broke ethics rules when she doled out just under $17,000 in a contract to a friend. That is about one family's worth of annual groceries. I am sure we all know of families that could use that money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669085">Now on to the scandals that I did not get to last time. I did not have time to describe the Julie Payette fiasco. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ignored the independent process put in place by the previous government to vet potential Governors General, as he thought he was smarter and could do it better himself. He picked his own. We know how that turned out, which was a disgrace to both the Governor General's staff and to the institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669086"> What about the <Affiliation DbId="300003" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>'s interference in the Nova Scotia shooting tragedy? He pressured RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki to publicly release information about the specific firearms used in the shooting in order to advance the federal government's misguided gun control legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669087"> These are ones I did not get to last time. I am just getting to them now. That is not to mention, following the resignation of the then ethics commissioner Mario Dion, due to overwork, I believe, the Liberal government decided to appoint Martine Richard, the sister-in-law of the current <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>, to replace him. Does this sound like nepotism to anyone? Again, where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669088">Under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, the sponsorship scandal may have been the spark that ignited the grand-scale Liberal penchant for lining their own pockets and those of their friends. Unfortunately, it was not the last. The Liberals and their buddies have discovered that their corruption is inflation-proof when it comes to padding their own personal fortunes. Therefore, here we are today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669089">After the documents for the SDTC scandal, the green slush fund, are finally handed over, Conservatives will raise concerns over the member from <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>'s company receiving over $120 million in government grants and contracts, including when he was minister. Although the minister has denied any wrongdoing, he went so far as to say text messages referring to a “Randy” uncovered during the committee hearing last summer, was not him, but, indeed, “another Randy”. The evidence tells a different story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669090">New text messages indicate that the member in question was in cabinet at the time and, at one point, the texts between the business partner and his client referred to a “Randy” being in Vancouver on September 6, 2022. We know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> was attending the Liberal government's cabinet retreat in the same city. Furthermore, Global News reported that the minister's former business partner was texting a “Randy” about deals involving a half-million dollar payment. Subsequently, that same business partner admitted that he had lied to Global News about the identity of the “other Randy”, confirming that it was, indeed, the member for Edmonton Centre who he was referring to in those now infamous text messages. However, the minister had the audacity to testify that the “Randy” referenced in those texts is not him, but another Randy, who just happened to work at the company he had a 50% ownership stake in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669091"> At the committee hearing, his business partner did come clean and testified that, indeed, there is only one Randy who ever worked at the company, and it was the minister himself. I guess he thought better than to stand by his original statement when he learned that section 132 of the Criminal Code of Canada states, “Every one who commits perjury is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.” Where is the accountability for the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages</Affiliation>? Where is the ministerial accountability? Where is ministerial integrity? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669092">Who can forget the Frank Baylis scandal? Frank Baylis left politics after only one term as an MP and was part of a consortium of companies that received $237 million to provide 10,000 ventilators in the spring of 2020. It sounds eerily similar to the situation of Navdeep Bains. When will Canadians find accountability restored again in their government? I can tell members: It will be when they elect a common-sense Conservative government. That is when. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669093">Now questions are arising about whether taxpayers are going to be funding one of the companies that Mark Carney works for days after he was announced as an adviser to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. As a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, on paper, he seems to be the perfect fit as a financial adviser to the PM. Unfortunately, it appears that he is cut from the same cloth when it comes to financial ethics, or lack thereof. What should come as no surprise, a potential conflict of interest has come in for Mr. Carney and his company, Brookfield, which could involve billions of taxpayer dollars. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669094"> I am moving on from millions of dollars now to talk about billions of taxpayer dollars. The Globe and Mail reported that the proposal floating around Bay Street and the halls of Parliament would see Brookfield Asset Management create a $50-billion investment vehicle, with $10 billion of that to be paid for by Canadian taxpayers, and members guessed it, Mark Carney is the chair of the board for Brookfield. He holds the title head of transition investing at Brookfield.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669095">How much is $10 billion? How do we wrap our heads around understanding how much $10 billion is? It is the equivalent of 689,163 Canadian families' groceries for a year. Even that is a number too big, and I cannot fully fathom how it would impact Canadians if this were to come about. It is simply unacceptable that carbon tax Carney has been given the power by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to offer him advice on a company in which he holds $1 million in stock options. Why is there no conflict of interest screen being applied? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669096">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> were to grant Brookfield's request, does that not beg the question of how much money Mark Carney would stand to personally profit. The Financial Post reported that Brookfield immediately began lobbying the government for this money after the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> created a task force in last spring's budget to redirect Canadian pension fund investments. This was of course led by the former governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669097">What we do not know is if Mark Carney personally put efforts into pushing this through, as he refused to register as a lobbyist. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> protected carbon tax Carney by appointing him to a position in which he does not have to declare his conflicts of interest. Every day, more and new questions emerge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669098">As mentioned last September, Carney's close friend, who serves as the CEO of Telesat, Daniel Goldberg, received $2.1 billion in taxpayer loans to build a broadband network that other firms could have delivered at a fraction of the cost to taxpayers. Despite Carney's glaring conflict of interest, both the NDP and the Liberals decided to protect him from answering questions at the House of Commons committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669099">I ask my colleagues down the way why it is that NDP members have sold their souls to their Liberal partners and then ripped up the deal, and now they are saying they will sell them on a case-by-case basis. have they been caught protecting their own again? I do not know. Why can we not have transparency? The injustice never ends. The only way it would end would be after the next election, when Canadians would be able to take back their paycheques from the corrupt government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669100">To summarize, I have spoken to about 17 scandals that show the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada views the government and the government's treasury as his own personal slush fund, and that of his cabinet and their close friends, all to be used to improve their personal fortunes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669101">The lack of accountability starts with the Prime Minister, and this disease and corruption seems to pervade this cabinet. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> followed the lead of the Prime Minister and his colleagues by stepping up to gorge himself at the illicit Liberal banquet table. Will the real Randy please step up and take responsibility? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669102">We need change and accountability, and we need the kind of leadership that shows Canadian people that the government serves them and not the other way around. We need the kind of leadership offered by the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and a country where its citizens can both heat and eat. That government will only be found in one place, and that is with common-sense Conservatives, who presently sit on this side of the House. We will turn the Liberal hurt into the hope that Canadians need by bringing home a country where hard work pays off members's homes, my home and our homes. Let us bring it home. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669120">Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives have a proud record of hiding facts. The NDP, of course, supports the motion. We wanted to get to the bottom of the SNC-Lavalin scandal and the WE Charity scandal, just as we want to get to the bottom of this scandal, but the Conservatives did not share that. In fact, during the Harper regime, the Harper government and Harper Conservatives systematically blocked every single parliamentary inquiry into misspending. There were massive amounts, with $400 million in the ETS scandal and over $1 billion for the G8 scandal. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278703" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation> mentioned the $2.2 billion in the Phoenix pay scandal. There was also the anti-terrorism funding, which had no paper trail, at over $3 billion.

              <ParaText id="8669171">Subsequent to that time, a subamendment was moved in the name of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278513" Type="2">Flamborough—Glanbrook</Affiliation> to change one of the subparagraphs regarding the list of witnesses who are to appear before the committee for two hours each. The amendment would add “the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, who respected the order of the House and deposited unredacted documents,” and “Paul MacKinnon, former Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet, [responsible for] (Governance),”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669172">What we are debating now is the subamendment dealing with these two gentlemen. The thing that is striking about this is that the Privacy Commissioner, unlike so many other individuals who were expected to produce these documents, respected the order of the House and deposited unredacted documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669173"> When I listen to what is being said on the far side of the House by the government members, they act as if it is a horrendous breach of privacy, of civil rights, of civil liberties, of charter rights, of the ways in which we conduct business respectfully and of individual rights here in Canada, to ask for such documents. They say darkly that we will be possibly damaging the ability to engage in criminal prosecution in the future, if these documents are presented in this manner, but the Privacy Commissioner did not think so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669174">I am going to guess that the Privacy Commissioner did not think so, in part because of the other individuals whose names are on that list. More to the point, the Privacy Commissioner probably anticipated that we would be hearing back from some of these other people. The Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel for the House of Commons is on that list of individuals who would testify before the procedure and House affairs committee. That individual would be able to shed light on the kinds of documents, without getting into the specifics, that have been presented and the kind of information that they reveal and could point out where it looks like the redactions have had the effect of removing evidence that really could not be characterized in any conceivable way as triggering the rights of which the Liberals have such a punctilious concern.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669175"> The commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would, likewise, be able to shed some light on that. Both the testimony of the individual in receipt of the documents, who is not going to be called forward as a prosecution witness and therefore can look at them objectively, without any danger with regard to future court proceedings, and the testimony of the commissioner of the RCMP, who can indicate exactly what kinds of concerns they need to have, are very significant safeguards. In all fairness, their names were not added to the list back when the Privacy Commissioner submitted full, unredacted documents, but presumably the Privacy Commissioner was able to anticipate, as an intelligent individual in his position would do, that this would be the case. That should be no surprise. This comes from from the biography of the Privacy Commissioner, Philippe Dufresne, on the Privacy Commissioner's website:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669181"> I assume the Privacy Commissioner understands his mandate. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has a mandate to provide “legal and policy analyses and expertise to help guide Parliament’s review of evolving legislation to ensure respect for individuals’ right to privacy”. Someone whose job is to do that said it is okay to release unredacted documents and demonstrated that through his own provision of such documents. Also, his mandate is “providing legal opinions and litigating court cases to advance the interpretation and application of federal privacy laws”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669182">I think these are pretty strong pieces of evidence. The evidence we have from the initial report back on June 4 from the Auditor General indicates very strongly that there is something profoundly wrong with this fund that dwarfs any previous scandal of a similar sort because the numbers involved are so enormous. The sponsorship scandal that took place when a similar kind of fund was set up to be disbursed with very little oversight involved conflicts of interest and misallocated funds on a scale that is perhaps, I think I may be overstating things, 10% of the amount involved here. It might have been less than 10%. Here, an extraordinary proportion of funds seem to have been misallocated. The Auditor General selected, randomly, a subset of all the contracts and found that there were problems in a majority of those contracts, suggesting that the majority of the funds allocated may simply have gone to the wrong purposes entirely. Does this qualify as illegal use or merely as grotesquely inappropriate use, which is not illegal, thanks to rules that are so slipshod and so loosely written that it is almost impossible to fall afoul of them? That is a good question. I do not know. It is probably a little of each. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669192"> I want to say with regard to this that I was intimately involved in the procedure and House affairs hearings in 2011 into the purported contempt of Parliament of the then minority government headed by Stephen Harper. A series of charges were made against the government. One charge had to do with the procurement of jets. Another one had to do with an imaginary plan to set up for-profit prisons. This was the issue on which a vote of non-confidence was held. It endorsed the report of a committee that never actually finished reporting. I know this because I was sitting in that committee debating the content of an eventual report when the bells rang, ending our debate, so the vote could be held on concurrence in the report we had not actually finished writing. I think that is what the member is referring to. Ultimately, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> likes to point out, the government was found in contempt.

              <ParaText id="8669200"> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is quite right. We could, and probably should, go to an election. The House of Commons has a kind of tenuous confidence in the government right now, so it would seem. It should be understood that “confidence”, used in the parliamentary sense, does not mean robust confidence; it means unwillingness to trigger an election. Certainly, in this party, we are willing to go to an election and we would very much like to do so. My sense is that there is a willingness in the Bloc. The NDP is wavering, in the hopes the government will see the light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669201"> However, in terms of where Canadians are, it is abundantly clear. There has never been a prime minister, since polling started, who has been as unpopular as the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has been opposed by more people. The people of Canada deserve to have a say, regardless of what our rules are here. We can all agree that, morally, that ought to happen.

              <ParaText id="8669204">The reason I bring them up is that not only are these people very important to me, but these particular children, like all children in Canada, are the main reason I do what I do. I love them with all my heart. However, I worry about their financial futures after nine years of the government's reckless spending. The Liberal green slush fund we are talking about today is a prime example of just that. As I stated, I appreciate this opportunity to add my voice to the debate we are having here in the House, which we have been having for a number of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669205">I have listened to many speeches delivered by my colleagues on this issue, and I admire the perseverance they have shown in making sure the government is held accountable for its failure to produce the documents that were ordered by the House. It is shameful we are not able to move on to other business simply because the Liberals refuse to follow the rules.

              <ParaText id="8669206">One of my colleagues tallied up the number of scandals that have occurred under the Liberal government, and he came up with approximately 68 scandals, an alarming number to say the least. If we look at it another way, that means the Liberals are dealing with a new scandal about every two months. Some people, like myself, might wonder how this is even possible, especially since the Liberals got into power by claiming to be the most transparent and accountable party out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669207"> Spanish philosopher George Santayana is credited with saying, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” I find that very ironic given today's discussion. In fact, in October 2013, six months after becoming the leader of the Liberals, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tweeted, “It’s hard not to feel disappointed in your government when every day there is a new scandal.” What does that say about the Prime Minister? There has been scandal after scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669208">We on this side of the House have been dealing with this exact problem for nearly a decade now. In this particular instance, it is costing the taxpayer an eye-watering $400 million. This is not the kind of governance I wanted for my country. I know the majority of Canadians are also sick and tired of the Liberals' repeated failures and complete inability to manage public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669209">I would like to remind all members that the seats we are sitting in do not belong to us. They belong to the people, the taxpayers, who put their faith in us to represent their best interests and to make their lives better in whatever way we can. The people voted for us because they trusted our ability to govern honestly and openly, and that is something I personally hold very sacred. Watching the Liberals flout the rules of this institution by refusing to comply with the House order to produce documents is offensive, not just to me but to all Canadians. It is a slap in the face of democracy and it insults the very people who put MPs in this position of privilege, here in the House of Commons chamber, in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669210"> The overarching theme that appears to encompass the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s time in office over the last nine years is “rules for thee, but not for me”. What the public sees with the current government is hypocrisy at every turn. How are Canadians meant to trust a government when its leader continually says one thing but does another? The Prime Minister tells Canadians they need to cut down their emissions, and what does he do? He flies in a private jet, taking dozens of trips a month, and likely has one of the largest carbon footprints of anyone in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669211">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said “the budget will balance itself”, yet he has now spent more in the past nine years than all other previous prime ministers combined. The Prime Minister said he would maintain an open and transparent government when he got elected, yet the second the WE Charity scandal hit the headlines, he prorogued Parliament to avoid accountability. Time and time again, the Liberals fail to practise what they have preached, and they refuse to be held accountable for their failings.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669218"> The House of Commons has, without question, the right to order papers to be produced by the government, and it has done so in the appropriate way, by following the appropriate rules. The Liberals have failed to do their jobs and have broken those rules, yet again showcasing their disregard for the institution of Parliament and eroding public trust at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669219">One of the roles I am very fortunate to have had during my time as a member of Parliament was chair of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, otherwise known as OGGO. I took that job very seriously, because I knew there was great trust being put in me to uphold the rules and follow the procedures that had been set out and established by my predecessors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669220"> This was the job I was given, and I like to think I did it well and to the best of my ability. It was not difficult for me to follow the rules. I had some incredible support from the House of Commons committee staff, including the clerk and the analysts, so there was no reason I was unable to follow the letter of the law with their help and guidance. We have the same support here in the House of Commons, and I thank all the clerks and all the experts in this place who work so hard to make sure we can do our jobs properly for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669221"> With all of these great minds coming together, as well as the ease of access we now have with technology, one would think it would be easy to know and comply with the rules of Parliament. However, the Liberals still cannot seem to figure it out. Canadians expect that at the very least, their elected officials are the type of people who follow the rules and respect the institution of Parliament. This is why they elected us, and upholding these rules and institutions is one of the most basic functions of this role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669222"> What Canadians do not want to see are members of Parliament who are stalling the business of this country because they are desperately trying to cover up their $400-million scandal. That is exactly what is happening when they tune into CPAC these days. It is disappointing, yet not surprising, that the Liberals are doing anything they can to dodge accountability for their mistakes. What must be in these documents that the Liberals do not want Canadians to see? It makes us wonder.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669225">As someone who represents a riding that has been a world leader in developing the utilization of carbon capture and sequestration technology, otherwise known as CCUS, I know first-hand how important it is to ensure that the funding meant for this purpose goes to the right people and places. Thanks to investments made by the previous Conservative government, the CCUS facility at Boundary Dam power plant in my hometown of Estevan, Saskatchewan, has now been in operation for 10 years. As of the end of 2023, this facility had captured a total of over 5.8 million tonnes of CO2 since 2014, prevented it from entering our atmosphere and sequestered it two kilometres underground. This is exactly the kind of project that SDTC was meant to facilitate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669226">It is clear that, when taxpayers' funds are handled by a competent government, it creates an environment where innovation and development can flourish. We have seen it before, and, under the next Conservative government, I know we will see it again. Sadly, the reason we are having this debate today is that taxpayer funds at SDTC were abused to the tune of a whopping $400 million, not a penny of which has been paid back. Money was given by directors to companies that they had huge conflicts of interest with, companies that they were affiliated with and stood to gain from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669227">I come from a rural riding that has historically relied on the development of this country's abundant natural resources. The biggest industries in my constituency are agriculture and energy, and I can say right now that farmers are some of the best, most-educated environmentalists and stewards of the land that we will ever encounter. The innovation and ideas that our agriculture producers have had, and continue to have, to reduce emissions, improve our agriculture and so much more are astounding. They have done this all while producing some of the best crops in the world. I can only imagine what these producers could have done with the $400 million that the government misappropriated through SDTC. Liberals should be ashamed of themselves for trying to cover up such a gross and egregious misuse of taxpayers' dollars. One might ask this: Where did that money go and into whose pockets? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669228">I would like to focus on that figure for a moment because the amount of $400 million is difficult for the average person to really visualize. In times past, families and governments would count their nickels and dimes; over time, that was turned into dollars and cents, then into hundreds and thousands and then into millions and billions. If we look at the national debt, with the current government, we are counting trillions, with families still trying to keep up with the nickels and dimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669229">The Liberals have upped the ante in all the worst ways. Too much scandal has been coupled with too much spending, and Canadians have had enough. When the Liberal leader became <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the national debt was just over $612 billion. Today, nine years later, it has doubled to over $1.2 trillion. As mentioned, he has spent more in this time frame than all other previous prime ministers combined. As I stated before, I can only imagine the difference that $400 million would have made to the people in my riding if that money had been spent responsibly and constructively instead of being used for the Liberal green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669230">I know the town of Coronach, which has been absolutely devastated by the government's so-called just transition, would have benefited massively from just a small chunk of that money. It stands to lose up to 67% of the town's population by 2030 because of the government's policies and lack of support over the last nine years. Its local representatives have pleaded with the Liberals for more funding and more boots on the ground assistance, but they have been getting virtually nothing. They have even come all the way to Ottawa on multiple occasions to state their case before the government and the other House about the need for greater government support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669231">Instead of getting funding that might save their country, what do the people of Coronach see? They see rich Liberals getting even richer through corrupt and illegal means. They see a government that refuses to be accountable to the people who elected it. They see $400 million going to people who did nothing to earn it but rub shoulders with the right people in the right places. The system was blatantly abused, and the attempt to cover up this abuse by refusing to produce the ordered documents is almost as bad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669232">According to the Auditor General's report, there were 186 conflicts of interest in the grants that were delivered by SDTC. The amount given to projects in which board members of SDTC had a conflict of interest was roughly $334 million. For those following at home, such that the numbers add up, there was $58 million given to projects where the terms were not even ensured. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669233">These board members, I will remind the House, were appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and by Mr. Bains, the then minister of innovation, science and industry. They hand-picked these individuals and approved them for this job. The board members then felt it was appropriate to make funding decisions that benefited themselves. This is extremely concerning, and I will expand a little on why that is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669234">Since I became an MP in 2015, one of my biggest gripes with the government has been its unwavering devotion to creating unnecessary bureaucracy. Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to love nothing more than hiring a board of people to consult on every issue under the sun, and he has no problem whatsoever with billing the taxpayer for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669235">The Liberals create these boards and pay the members to consult, hold meetings and write reports; in many cases, there is almost no concrete benefit to show for it and little to no accountability for the board members. These people are paid with taxpayers' dollars. By “taxpayers”, I mean the hard-working Canadians who go out to do a job and get paid for their work. These people then pay taxes on that income. That is how governments make money. The current government likes to take the money from them to pay bureaucracies rather than using it to benefit the very people who work for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669236">My worry is this: If the board of SDTC was able to waste and abuse 400 million taxpayer dollars so flippantly, how many other boards appointed by the government are doing the same? Are we just starting to scratch the surface or only beginning to really see the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how deep this scandal might truly run? As we know, an iceberg is always bigger under the water than what is seen on the surface. Oftentimes, the cover-up is worse than the crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669237">In this case, the Liberals will not even give the authorities the chance to determine how bad the crime really is. We know it is bad. The famous Liberal sponsorship scandal that brought down the government of the time was about $40 million, and this is 10 times that amount. As I mentioned before, it is a number so high that most struggle to really conceptualize it, including myself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669238">The $400-million scandal we are debating here today is not the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s first. It is far from it. In fact, I am sure we all remember the WE Charity scandal, which was a whopping $600 million that the Prime Minister gave to his friends and Liberal insiders. He obviously did not learn his lesson then, and it is likely that he will not learn anything from this situation either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669239">We also had the ArriveCAN app, otherwise known as arrive scam; it cost the taxpayers $56 million for something that could have been created for a few thousand dollars. I am sure my constituents who cannot afford groceries would have loved a piece of that wasted $56 million, but I digress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669240">There was also the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> unethically and inappropriately interfered with our country's justice system by pressuring a cabinet minister to do something against her greater judgment. That is a prime example of how he has absolutely zero regard for the rule of law of this country; it shows that he truly believes he can do whatever he wants without consequences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669241">I would like to wrap up my remarks by reminding my colleagues that Remembrance Day is soon approaching. As the son of a veteran and as someone who was raised to have the utmost respect for the men and women who have fought for this country, we need a government that does better. Our veterans fought for us to be able to live peacefully and safely in this country, which upholds the rule of law above all else. The least we can do as parliamentarians is to reflect that value here in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669242">I call on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberals to stop the cover-up and produce the documents so that we can get back to the work that truly matters. Better yet, he can just call a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

We want to get to the bottom of this latest Liberal scandal, as we did with WE Charity and with the SNC-Lavalin scandal. However, the reality is that my colleague, whom I have a lot of respect for, talked about where the money has gone. This is a question that Canadians have been asking since the Harper regime was in place; the Harper Conservatives absolutely, steadfastly blocked any possibility of finding out what happened to the money in the various Conservative scandals. There was the ETS scandal, for $400 million, and the G8 scandal. We remember the gazebos and a billion dollars, the Phoenix pay scandal of $2.2 billion and the anti-terrorism funding, where they simply lost the paper trail, of $3.1 billion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8669268">Madam Speaker, what a tough act to follow, my colleague with those brilliant words about accountability for the government. It has been a month that the House of Commons remains at a standstill. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and these NDP-Liberals will stop at nothing to throw sand in the gears of Parliament in a blatant attempt to cover up their costly corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669269">These documents are still missing. The taxpayer money is still gone. The dirty deeds still go unpunished. It has been more than a month. When we look at the numbers, it is astounding: $400 million vanished, 186 conflicts of interest, one government in contempt of Parliament. It refuses to hand over the evidence to the RCMP and that is exactly why we are here. It does not want Canadians to know who got the money and how. It does not want Canadians to know how badly it mismanaged this boondoggle. It does not want the RCMP to start sniffing around on what is actually going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669270">That just tells us whatever is in those documents must be really bad. It must be more than our usual garden-variety Liberal corruption. If they shut down Parliament for a month, there must be something brutal in those documents. I think Canadians have a right to know; that is why we are still here. Day in and day out, parties in the House are demanding the Liberals do their basic duty and provide transparency that Canadians deserve and, frankly, the Speaker demanded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669271">They stand up claiming the government is working in the best interest of Canadians, as that is what their objective is, but it is a bit rich from a party that has now stopped this place from operating for a month. The paper trail must be so long and lead all the way to the top. That is the only conclusion to draw from why they have stopped this place from working for a month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669272">Nearly 10 years ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pledged he would lead the most “transparent” and “open” government in the world. Those were his words. Ten years later, it is easy to see just how far they have fallen. His caucus is now forced to do the dirty work to cover up yet another scandal from the government. If stonewalling documents about corruption for months on end is the behaviour of the world's most transparent government, I would hate to see what happens in the world's least transparent government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669273">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wanted to make the promise about transparency, maybe he should have said he would lead the most transparently corrupt and incompetent government. That would be a promise he could certainly brag about keeping. That would be one that would result in us not having to be here, certainly, for a month, arguing with them about their basic duty to turn over the documents to the cops.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669274">Conservatives have a plan, and they have a plan on keeping a promise, too. Our promise is to hold the government accountable for every bad decision it makes, for every grifter who gets rich off Canadian tax dollars and for every ethical lapse in judgment from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the cabal of Liberals who have been a problem in that respect, and every conflict of interest. That is the duty of the opposition, it is one that we take seriously, and it is one we will argue for here in this place for as long as it takes for these guys to actually be accountable to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669275">We will not let up until we make sure Canadians have the answer and this does not happen again. Now, it seems with the culture of corruption, with the Liberal and the NDP members, it has transferred over to another party. It seems like the Bloc wants in on the action too. It is offering the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a secret deal to let him off the hook for this corruption and incompetence in order to serve the Bloc's narrow interest. It is a deal with the devil, so to speak, between them and the federal government, to see all the corruption swept under the rug until the next scandal. We know there will be another one, to get a firmer grip on power and play politics with the rights and the privileges and the obligations of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669276">When Canadians look at this Parliament, they see Liberals and Conservatives and NDP and Bloc and Green Party members, but now it is clear, while there are five parties that actually sit here, there are really only two parties: one mega-party that supports the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his agenda, blindly voting to declare continued unaccountability to the Canadian people, but more than that, unfettered confidence in his leadership; and only one party that is really standing up for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669277">However, after nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the most devoted Liberals are realizing that the Prime Minister's corruption and incompetence are just too much to handle. At least 24 of them, 24 that we know of, have finally seen the light. They are demanding a change because the writing is on the wall. They feel it in their own constituencies, with people who used to be excited to see them. They are fed up with everything that the Prime Minister has become and that he said he would not do. They see record-high inflation and home prices. They see out-of-control government spending. They just see how out of reach life has become in Canada. They, like all of us, like almost every Canadian, have lost confidence in the Prime Minister. Really, who can blame them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669278"> It is now evident that the Liberals will do anything to stay in power; even a humiliating U-turn that we saw last week on immigration when they set these sky-high targets and then had to reverse themselves; even throwing around unfounded conspiratorial accusations, like we just heard from questioning right before me, about the<Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9"> Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and foreign governments. The tinfoil hats over there must be real tight; even turning the trite and, frankly, ridiculous fearmongering about individual rights, things like abortion in this country, that every Canadian now sees through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669279">This is the same old strategy: divide and conquer; divide this country into smaller and smaller pieces so it is easier to keep a grip on power and make sure that everybody forgets how miserable the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made their life. Canadians are tired of this. They are tired of the division and they are tired of being labelled as some kind of “other”. They are tired of being told that north is south, up is down and wrong is right. Certainly, they are tired of a government that cares more about itself than Canadians. That is what this whole saga is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669280">It is not just the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who is not in it for Canadians. He is in it for himself and for his friends. As long as he has to cling to the job for a bit longer, to ship some more money off to Liberal insiders, he will do whatever it takes to stay in power. The Liberals will do whatever it takes to argue in this place, rather than do their duty and hand over the documents to the RCMP, like the Speaker ordered them to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669281">Look at everything happening outside of this place: violent crime is up 30%; crimes with firearms have doubled in this country since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to power; there are illegal drugs on our streets; loved ones cannot get the help that they need; and car theft in my home region of York is up 300% in just three years. There are members of the Liberal caucus who are celebrating an hourly drop in auto theft patterns and they are patting themselves on the back for it. They do not need to celebrate a 20% decrease in auto theft when it has increased 300% under their watch. That is not success; it is a victory lap on failure. Yet, that is exactly what they are doing. The average home price in that same region is $1.3 million. There has been runaway deficit spending by a <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> who still misses her targets. Canadians, who are already struggling to make ends meet and afford a place to live, are staring down the barrel of even more tax hikes and price increases. We have seen it day after day, month after month, year after year, for nine years of these guys.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669282">We just found out that platforms like Spotify are raising subscription fees. The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> already told everybody in this House and every Canadian that she would cut Disney+, and I guess she is going to have to tell them to cut Spotify, too. That is the latest of the tone-deaf condescending suggestions from a finance minister who has somebody else pulling the strings in her own department. That is not to mention the serious allegation of election interference from foreign states and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s dangerous complicity in it, or the instability and the insanity happening on the other side of the world in the Middle East, or the out-of-control anti-Semitism on our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669283">We cannot talk about any of that in this place. We cannot fix any of those things because the government is focused on running out the clock while it tries to cover up for its own mismanagement, its own scandal-ridden government. That is what this debate is about. It is about making sure that we no longer let the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> use his office as a platform to enrich his friends and his own self-interest at the taxpayer's expense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669284">There is an easy fix to all of this, and it can happen in mere minutes: The government just needs to release the documents, give them all to the cops. That is all, and we can put the issue to bed today. Release the full documents to the RCMP, not at a committee and not in their redacted form. If the Liberals truly had nothing to hide, then they should not be scared of anything, certainly not of turning the documents over. There is no reason why the release cannot happen, except for the government's own obstinance in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669285">We can tell by the arguments they are making that the Liberals are desperate to avoid accountability. They are blathering on about their endless nonsense about the charter, which they have used to trample on the rights of Canadians when it suits them, and about committees so that the issue dies a slow death under the guise of transparency, and so on. The charter was created to protect Canadians from their government; it was not created to protect the government from Canadians and from accountability, from the people who actually voted them in here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669286"> Equally, if there are allegations and there is wrongdoing, we do not call a committee; we call the RCMP, the institution with the power to prosecute the corruption and to get Canadian taxpayers their money back and get them accountability to see what their government is doing with their money. That is the least the government can do in this place after a month of arguing about the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669287">That is what has come after nine years of the Liberal government: We now need the Mounties to come in to sort things out because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is obviously not able to sort things out by himself, or more likely, because he is covering up something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669288">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is out of his depth in every single way. When it comes to representing Canada on the world stage, he allows the nation to be humiliated and embarrassed time and time again, whether it is with a stirring rendition of <I>Bohemian Rhapsody</I>, allowing our country to become a playground for hostile foreign governments, or managing our economy. It is a shocker that the guy who says that the economy grows out from the heart believes that the budget will balance itself. He does not think of monetary policy and could not grow the economy, balance the budget, control inflation rates or interest rates in any way not just for this generation but for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669289">Even when it comes to doing basic things, the government could not even make a simple app work. It took months, and it sent 10,000 people inadvertently, unjustified, to a quarantine. The app should have never existed. We did not need it, and it could have been built in a weekend if we had needed it at all. Certainly there is also corruption in that case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669290">It is no wonder that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s caucus and his party are revolting against the Prime Minister, even in former fortresses like downtown Montreal and downtown Toronto, where people have just repudiated nine years of the Prime Minister by electing members from other parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669291">One thing the Prime Minister excels at and we should give him some credit for is shipping off other people's money to line the pockets of Liberal insiders, as well as to fund pet projects and money to massive corporations, while Canadians go hungry and lose sight of the country we all once knew and loved. He has given $12 million to Loblaws,; $26 million to Costco; over $100 million to McKinsey; $107 million to GC Strategies, the two-person company run out of a basement in Ottawa; $900 million to the WE Charity; $50 million to Mastercard; and billions of dollars of bloated bureaucracy to Bombardier and, of course, to the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669292">Additionally, no one can forgive or forget the $100 million that the government has shipped to UNRWA, an agency founded to employ terrorists, which participated in the October 7 massacre and is now trying to argue that it is legally immune from being responsible for doing so. Again, the money is being spent while Canadians go dumpster diving because they cannot afford the price of food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669293">The Conservatives will put an end to all of this. We will put an end to the corporate welfare that lines the pockets of Liberal insiders doing nothing to create jobs or prosperity in this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669294"> We will immediately stop funding UNRWA and start funding our own NATO allies instead. We will of course defund CBC, without question, and maybe CBC first. Simply put, we will give Canadians back control of their money, their wallets and their lives, which is something the government has refused to do time and time again. It is why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669295">It has been almost a month of arguing over why the government will not turn over documents that you, Mr. Speaker, told it to turn over, and why the Liberals will cower from accountability for the people, the taxpayers, to know where their money went, who it enriched and what is in the documents. If the Liberals had nothing to hide, they would turn the documents over today and we could end this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669296">We can then get back to Parliament and fix the things the Liberals have broken in this country after nine years. We can cut taxes, build homes, fix the budget and stop crime. There are any number of issues that the Liberals have screwed up over nine years, and we can get back to business if they just turn over the documents to the RCMP, exactly like you, Mr. Speaker, told them to.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669313">Today I met two young girls with diabetes who are visiting Parliament. They told me their story and talked to me about what it is like to live with this disease on a daily basis. I was impressed by their courage and their resilience, but also by their determination to pursue their hopes and dreams despite their diagnosis. I can relate to what these two young girls are experiencing, because my son Charles was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in February 2017, when he was 18. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669314">Thanks to research, the supplies Charles uses have gotten a lot better. Now it is much easier for him to manage his disease on a daily basis, which enables him to thrive as a phys ed teacher. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the people living with diabetes and the loved ones who support them. I am pleased that our government is working to develop a national universal plan that will provide coverage for a wide range of medications.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669316">Mr. Speaker, after nine long years, Canadians are desperate for a change from the NDP-Liberal government. Food Banks Canada recently released its HungerCount report. Over two million Canadians are visiting food banks each month. The report found a 6% increase in food bank visits compared to the previous year, which had already broken a previous record. That is what we are seeing happen under this carbon tax regime. The failed socialist experiment starves Canadians and attacks our energy industry, which is key to western Canada's economy and fuels prosperity across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669317">Back home in Saskatchewan, Food Banks of Saskatchewan has said that children make up 30% of people in need nationally. However, in Saskatchewan, that number jumps to 39% for children. That is almost a 10% increase. Meanwhile, the total number of visits has gone up 42% since 2019 due to the carbon tax, inflation and housing costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669318">The Liberals refuse to fix what they broke, and that is exactly why Canadians are demanding change. The Conservatives stand ready to axe the tax and bring home affordability.

The Bloc Québécois believes that the recommendations in this report do not fulfill their own purpose, which is to guide the government and members of Parliament on the best path to take to advance public policy and solve the problems that need to be fixed. That is why we prepared a supplementary report.</ParaText>

In light of that decision, along with the irregularities that were identified and publicly condemned, it would have been advisable for the committee to take into account more of the concerns raised by witnesses and detailed in the briefs. Issues raised in most of the written submissions were an alleged lack of transparency on behalf of the Nuclear Waste Management Organization, or NWMO, the Crown corporation Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, or AECL, and its supplier, privately owned Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, as well as the inadequate approach in the maintenance of national inventories, the lack of transparency in accessing these data, and the appearance of an alleged conflict of interest with the NWMO structure and between the CNSC and Department of Natural Resources.</ParaText>

It is on the side of a hill, partly surrounded by wetlands that drain into the Ottawa River less than one kilometre away [I invite the people who are in favour of the project to go drink the water from the river]. The site is tornado and earthquake prone; the Ottawa River is a major fault line. Underlying bedrock at the site is porous and fractured and the groundwater table is very close to the surface.</QuotePara>

Modelled after an ordinary municipal dump, it will] cover an area the size of 70 NHL hockey rinks. Waste destined for the mound has accumulated over eight decades of operation at Chalk River Laboratories; waste is also being imported [from other domestic and international sites] for emplacement in the mound. It would contain dozens of radioactive and hazardous materials and tonnes of heavy metals [I will not list them all, there really are too many of them]. Cobalt-60 and Cesium-137 sources in the dump would give off so much intense gamma radiation that workers must use lead shielding to avoid dangerous radiation exposures. The International Atomic Energy Agency says these are “intermediate-level waste” and require emplacement underground [should not be on a mound]. Dioxin, PCBs, asbestos, mercury, up to 13 tonnes of arsenic and hundreds of tonnes of lead would go into the dump. It would also contain thousands of tonnes of copper and iron, tempting scavengers to dig into the mound after closure. <I /></QuotePara>

The mound is expected to leak during operation and break down due to erosion. Studies predict several types of leakage will occur during filling and after closure of the facility. The waste water plant for the NSDF would discharge contaminated water containing large quantities of tritium...and smaller quantities of many other radioactive substances [there are too many for me to list].

              <ParaText id="8669655">The CRA is committed to increasing the transparency and accountability of charitable organizations by providing relevant information about them to the public, in accordance with the disclosure provisions of the Income Tax Act, or the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669656">The confidentiality provisions of the act prevent the CRA from commenting on specific cases without the consent of an authorized representative of the organization. However, as an exception to the general rules around taxpayer confidentiality, the act allows for certain information about registered and revoked charities to be released to the public. The CRA’s legal authority for the public disclosure of that information is found in subsections 149.1(15) and 241(3.2) of the act. Any information or document that is not explicitly identified by those disclosure provisions cannot be provided to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669657">For further details on what information is publicly available, please see “How to get information about a charity” at https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/information-about-a-charity.html.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669660">Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), the Canada Border Services Agency, CBSA, assessment and revenue management, CARM, cutover period will extend from October 4, 2024, at 4 p.m. ET, to October 21, 2024, at 3 a.m. ET.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669661">With regard to part (b), during this period, the submission of electronic accounting documents, B3s, must be held by trade chain partners until CARM functionality and the commercial accounting declaration, CAD, is available on October 21, 2024. However, paper accounting documents will continue to be accepted and processed at CBSA commercial offices. The ability to release commercial goods at the border and maintain border fluidity is not impacted during the CARM cutover period. The CBSA’s system to process commercial releases, known as the accelerated commercial release operations support system, ACROSS, is not impacted by cutover activities and remains available with the exception of a maintenance window that will extend from the evening of Saturday, October 5, 2024, to the morning of Sunday, October 6, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669662">With regard to part (c), the CBSA has developed transition measures to ensure continued border fluidity and timely submission of accounting and payment of duties after CARM implementation on October 21, 2024. A full account and description of the CARM transitional measures can be found at https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/cn-ad/cn24-27-eng.html.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669663">With regard to part (d), regulatory changes will come into force on October 21, 2024. These regulations will introduce a 180-day transition period following CARM implementation, from October 21, 2024, to April 19, 2025, to allow time for importers to obtain financial security. This will give importers and their service providers time to adapt to the new financial security model and avoid border disruptions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669664">With regard to part (e), the government is not projecting that any business will be subjected to financial harm during the transition period. During the cutover period and for a period of 90 calendar days following the October 21, 2024, implementation, the CBSA will not be issuing late accounting penalties, late payment penalties or late payment interest. The CBSA may adjust this to further mitigate the transition to CARM system if it is deemed necessary.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669713">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to talk about nuclear energy and some other associated important issues. The issues are related to carbon neutrality, net zero and all the efforts our government and various other governments across this country are making to encourage and join a green and clean revolution when it comes to how we generate electricity and how we get our energy in Canada and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669714">I have to start by acknowledging the devastating impacts climate change is having on Planet Earth, but specifically here in Canada. Our planet is literally burning up and climate change is the root cause. Already we know that Canada is warming at a rate two times greater than the rest of the world. The wildfires last year blanketed Canada with smoke. They burned over 18 million hectares, which is a size that is unfathomable, larger than many mid-sized countries, and displaced 200 communities and 232,000 Canadians from their homes. In fact, 42% of the world's people displaced due to wildfires were Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669715">Let us put that in perspective. Canada has 0.5% of the world's population and is responsible for 1.5% of global emissions, which means, for the Conservative members opposite, that our emissions are more than three times higher than average. Therefore it is important to recognize that we measure emissions not by the flag a country has, and most countries have one, but per capita. In Canada, our emissions are very high per capita but are coming down because of technologies like nuclear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669716">Despite Canada's very small population, more than 40% of the world's population that has been displaced from its home due to wildfires in the last year was Canadian. If that does not tell the Conservative members, who are now having a conversation, that we are vulnerable to climate change and the impacts of extreme weather, then I do not know what does. I think it is clear they drank the oil-and-gas Kool-Aid and there is no coming back to reason for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669717">The cost of natural disasters has ballooned by over 1200% since the 1970s. Just this past summer, damages from severe weather costs were over $7 billion in insurable losses, making it the most destructive season on record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669718">Doing nothing is not an option. There is no question that the threat of climate change is existential, but today, despite the challenges, Canada finds itself in a unique and actually highly enviable position, because for Canada, action on climate change does not just mitigate floods, fires and droughts but also presents a generational economic opportunity, one we have not seen since the Industrial Revolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669719">Global finance and the global economy are beginning to rapidly transform in ways that are creating many economic opportunities for those who approach the transition to a low-carbon future in a thoughtful and focused manner. In the global race to net zero, an electricity grid that powers our homes, businesses, industries, cars and country with clean, reliable and affordable energy is mission-critical in every province and territory right across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669720">The good news is that Canada already has a head start with a very clean grid. More than 80% is non-emitting; that is because we have hydroelectric, wind, solar, and yes indeed, nuclear. It is true in Ontario, and very much because of nuclear power; in fact, the story of nuclear in Ontario is one of considerable success. Nuclear energy helped make the phase-out of coal possible in Ontario, resulting in smog days' going from 53 in 2005 to zero in 2015, all while dramatically cutting carbon emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669721">I remember 2005, because I relied on the atmosphere for my line of work at that time; I was an endurance athlete. I competed in kayaking on a world stage for Canada. I was just coming off a successful Olympics in 2004, when in 2005, the air in the greater Toronto area was too dirty to breathe for my training. I had to travel to Germany that summer and train in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands in order to benefit from a clean environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669722">How tragic it is that the air in the greater Toronto area in the summer of 2005 was not compatible with endurance sports, where one has to consume hundreds of litres of oxygen every hour in order to perform those activities. Since that time, because we phased out coal, our air is much cleaner. There are measurable impacts on health. People do not get sick and die from cardiovascular- and respiratory-related distress as frequently as they used to, and that is worth the investment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669723">As we transition our energy grid to net zero in the coming years, nuclear is not only a silver bullet but also in many provinces is likely to play a very important role as a source of baseload power. Canada is a tier-one nuclear nation, and we have been safely operating nuclear energy and safely managing nuclear waste for decades. Under the world-class independent regulator the Canada Nuclear Safety Commission, there is no question that Canada is a leader. From medical isotopes to small modular reactors, responsible uranium development and CANDU technology, Canada is a nuclear leader, and the sector drives significant economic activity within the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669724">However, I want to point out that earlier when I mentioned isotopes, the Bloc Québécois said it was some kind of a red herring and that I was distracting from the real issues. That could not be farther from the truth. I was visiting a hospital recently where staff talked about how important medical isotopes are for their processes and how about 90% of them get furnished here in Canada because of our systems. They suggested that we could still make medical isotopes, but maybe not the power. It just does not work like that. The system works in conjunction, supplying our energy grid with clean electricity and at the same time providing our medical system with isotopes that literally save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669725">That is why we are supporting provinces that choose to use nuclear energy, so they can further develop renewables, support a zero-emissions electricity grid, create jobs and give businesses and industry an enormous competitive advantage over other jurisdictions. That is why we announced $74 million to support SaskPower's leadership on the province's deployment of a GE Hitachi small modular nuclear reactor by the middle of next decade. It is why we announced an investment of $50.5 million for small modular nuclear reactors in New Brunswick and almost $1 billion to develop Canada's first grid-scale, small modular nuclear reactor in Ontario, set to reduce emissions by 740,000 tonnes, the equivalent of millions of vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669726">This is a national conversation and effort. Work among provinces, territories and indigenous leaders, utilities and industry, the private sector, unions and academics, as well as civil society, are all needed to build a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid together. It is also an international conversation about how the world can have non-emitting baseload power that we need in order to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669727">Right now, when there is an on-demand power issue in Ontario, there is a gas-fired power plant just outside my riding in Halton Hills that fires up and provides the grid with intermittent power when necessary. I was driving by it yesterday, and the effluent coming out of the facility was very significant. It was not just steam, as the Conservatives just suggested. Steam is not brown. It is disappointing that in 2024-25, we still burn natural gas in order to produce electricity, because indeed we do not actually need natural gas. There are other options that are cleaner, greener and cheaper, and those are the ones we need in order to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669728">We are going to continue to fight climate change and to power low-carbon economies right around the world. Experts show the world that nuclear power is necessary if we are going to meet our objectives. Scenarios under the IEA and IPCC say nuclear is an important piece of that puzzle. Canada can and will continue to play a role in it, just as we have for decades, helping our allies reduce emissions with our state-of-the-art technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669729">The world is looking for leadership in the fight against climate change, so it turns to us as we put a cap on oil and gas pollution. It turns to us as we join it in putting in place a price on pollution, a carbon price, as we build out the clean hydrogen sector and we promote a renewable energy boom, just as we support clean nuclear energy. Building out low-carbon electricity grids is not just a competitiveness issue; it is also a climate change issue and a global security issue and. As I have pointed out, it is also a health care concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669730">When Russia launched its illegal, reprehensible invasion of Ukraine, the energy security apparatus moved to the forefront of the global conversation. Our European allies worked to replace Russian energy imports with those from other countries while accelerating their transition towards non-emitting and more secure forms of energy, including renewables, hydrogen and nuclear.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669731">International interest in Canada's nuclear industry is coming from countries looking to refurbish their existing CANDU reactors, one of the greatest Canadian inventions, and to build new reactors as well. Canada was proud to support Romania's clean power future by making available up to $3 billion in export financing for Canadian CANDU reactors. This will help Romania reduce emissions while also removing its reliance on Russian energy. That is a key way to support Romania, but it is also supporting Ukraine, Poland and other European allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669732">One hundred per cent of the dollars being financed by the Canadian government will flow to Canadian companies. Much of this will go to small and medium-sized Canadian companies involved in those energy sectors. There are nearly 200 companies across Canada currently supplying products or services to the nuclear industry, including existing CANDU reactors, that will be well positioned to compete for supply contracts. This means more good jobs and great economic opportunity for Canadians. The benefits of nuclear energy are enormous, for the fight against climate change, our economy and creating good jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669733">However, it must be done safely. Safety is always our top priority when it comes to nuclear energy. Our world-class nuclear safety regime is administered by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, an independent regulator that makes science-based, objective decisions and regularly undergoes peer reviews from world-renowned organizations. As an International Atomic Energy Agency member, Canada implements practices that align with the best practices and guidelines of the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669734">All radioactive waste in Canada is currently being safely managed according to international standards at facilities that are licensed and monitored by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. In fact, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development said in his audit that Canada is successfully managing all radioactive waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669735">The Bloc Québécois, however, says these decisions about nuclear safety should be made by politicians. Frankly, I could not disagree more. We in the House are not experts on dealing with nuclear waste. Elected members of Parliament should never intervene in and override the international controls and safety measures that objective science says are needed, and we must always rely on experts, research and science in those decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669736">We have seen objective scientific fact be thrown aside for political purposes. We see it with the Conservatives, who are against doing anything on climate change even though it is hurting our economy and our communities. We see it with the New Democrats, who flip-flopped on the carbon price. Obviously, we are now seeing it with the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669737">The carbon price is a policy that will be responsible for reducing one-third of our emissions; it is already having that impact. The Conservatives want to bring us back to a time under Stephen Harper when they did nothing on climate change. They did not even care about lowering our emissions. They abandoned our Paris commitments. In fact, in the House, I have heard them ridicule the Paris Agreement—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669760">I wonder if the Conservative members ever read what the 17 SDGs are. If they would like, they could perhaps share which sustainable development goal they find most reprehensible. Perhaps it is clean water; perhaps it is no hunger; perhaps it is education for all, or perhaps it is equity. Perhaps it is partnerships, because we know the Conservatives think they can operate in a silo all on their own, without international co-operation, without international frameworks and agreements, and without attending United Nations meetings or going to COP. </ParaText>

Any new nuclear reactor takes more than a decade, and the costs break the bank of any province.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669795"> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the nuclear-supportive residents of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke to speak against the Bloc's dissenting report recommendations that put my constituents' health and safety at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669796">The Bloc calls on the government to pull the plug on over a decade of work toward securing low-level radioactive waste located on the grounds of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited in Chalk River, Ontario. Many of my constituents are deeply troubled by the anti-science ideology this motion represents. If the government were to even entertain the report's recommendation, it would set us back years, if not decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669797">Despite the government's best efforts, Canadians can be proud of our history and in particular Canada's incredible contributions to the development of nuclear science. Much of that science was done at Chalk River, just 200 kilometres west of here. What the scientists, engineers and all the staff at Chalk River have accomplished over the years is remarkable. There is an incredible history that not enough Canadians hear about. Maybe if Chalk River was in Montreal or Toronto, the CBC would have told that story by now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669798">While the Bloc's dissenting report and recommendations are environmentally harmful, this debate provides me with an opportunity to tell more Canadians about the proud legacy of AECL. I think it is important that we understand the history of how we got here, the science behind how we got here and where we go from here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669799">Before I dive in, if any Canadian watching at home or half-listening in the House wants to know more about the plans for securing low-level waste, they can check out my YouTube channel. That is where I posted a series of videos from an interview that I did with the former president of Canadian Nuclear Laboratories about its plans to secure the waste in what is now known as the near surface disposal facility, or NSDF for short. All they need to do is click the videos and scroll down, way down in fact. This is because the interview is from seven years, which was essentially the halfway point in what has been a long and thorough process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669800">In the years leading up to that, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories had been conducting in-depth studies on where to locate the near surface disposal facility to contain the low-level radioactive waste from nearly 80 years of operation at Chalk River. The reactors at Chalk River did not produce electricity; they were research reactors. Along with the Nobel Prize-winning research, the reactors produced more than a billion life-saving medical isotopes. Hundreds of thousands of people are living happy, healthy lives because of the work at Chalk River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669801">During those 80 years, the staff at Chalk River always sought to apply the best methods to contain waste that were available at the time. This included burying some types of waste in sand pits on site. In fact, 90% of the waste that is to be stored in the facility is at the site right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669802">Let me be clear: 90% of the low-level waste is located at Chalk River on the shore of the Ottawa River right now. This Bloc report is recommending that the government politically interfere in the operations of AECL and restart the entire process. That would set us back 15 years and leave the low-level waste where it is currently stored around the campus, including in sand pits. The separatists cannot claim to care about the Ottawa River, then demand we delay cleaning up the waste sites along it. That is like putting a round peg in a “Bloc” hole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669803">The dissenting report calls on the government to restart the review process, but this time under the Liberals' unconstitutional Impact Assessment Act. Opponents of nuclear science can restart the process as many times as they like, but it will not change that the site selected was the best location based on a detailed geological analysis of the lands around the campus. Those opposed to the project claim its location is the problem; it is only a kilometre away from the Ottawa River. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669805">How far or how close the river is is not as important as what is underneath the chosen site and its elevation. The selected site sits on bedrock, and the foundations would be 50 metres above the water. That would ensure that it would be safe from flooding. Moving the site further from the river would increase the chance of flooding and leakage. That obviously sounds counterintuitive, but countering our intuitions is why we invented the scientific method. The scientific method allows humans to check their bias.</ParaText>

As the Bloc made clear, who needs nuclear power when we can flood more indigenous territory for the next dam project? Quebec's access to hydro power does not make it more virtuous.

Whether it is fission or fusion, nuclear power is the only way humanity could power a net-zero world. The laws of physics set an absolute minimum amount of energy required to pull CO2 out of the air. Unless the church of climate socialism has a plan to have all animals stop exhaling, the energy of the future will be powered by nuclear science. </ParaText>

That should satisfy the anti-science MPs in the Bloc, yet no matter what the minister decides, or what the Bloc writes in its report, it will not change the facts on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669815">The fact is that the Government of Canada has a responsibility to clean up Chalk River.

It is because of the workers, the men and women who work in nuclear, that this is possible. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. It is the technology that is going to get us through the challenging times right now with the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669837">We have a lot of things to be thankful for when it comes to nuclear, the supply chain that we have in Canada and the CANDU technology. Lights are on right now in this building, and 60% of electricity in Ontario comes from nuclear. It is true that we were able to phase out coal in Ontario and eliminate smog because of nuclear, but there are still some radicals who do not like nuclear. Some people just never change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669838">However, it was nuclear that got Ontario off coal. Nuclear is in a renaissance right now because of security. We have war in Europe and hot spots around the world. Its energy security is what future societies will need. Nuclear is positioned well to take advantage of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669839"> Another great benefit of nuclear is medical isotopes. There are literally millions of lives saved because of nuclear, and we are very grateful for the medical isotopes and the research that is done at facilities across Canada, especially at Chalk River. Some of the breakthroughs out of Chalk River have been a game-changer, as described to me by oncologists and other specialists in the medical community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669840">We have a debt of gratitude for all the workers in the nuclear supply chain as well. It keeps the lights on and drives our economy with powerful paycheques. It is something that should be championed, not disparaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669841"> Those same workers have been getting a little whiplash with the current government. Sometimes, it is very cold to nuclear, calling it a sin stock and refusing to fund nuclear in the ways that it should be funded. It is typical. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669842">Something was mentioned earlier in the debate about SDTC, which is the Sustainable Development Technology Fund from which the Liberals got caught funnelling $400 million to Liberal insiders: Those dollars were to go to technology. I cannot think of a better one than nuclear. Whenever we have an election and there is a change in government, the workers out there will be respected for the good work they do in providing clean, affordable electricity for all Canadians. We will see that change as soon as we elect common-sense Conservatives in the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669843"> Another big change that is going to happen is for Conservatives to get rid of the carbon tax. People have probably heard this many times: It is technology, not taxes. There are a lot of different technologies to pick from. Renewables have a place in our grid, but there are issues with renewables. The waste that comes from renewables is the biggest issue, but we will get into that in a bit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669844">A newly elected Conservative government will axe the carbon tax and invest in such technologies as nuclear, which has emissions-free electricity that has powered Ontario for decades. Now, with the right support and environment, I believe that nuclear can make the next renaissance here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669845"> This is a stark difference from what the NDP-Liberal government is promising to do. It is talking about quadrupling that tax to 61¢ per litre. When that happens, there will be economic carnage from coast to coast to coast. We are all suffering in a cost of living crisis, and they are planning to quadruple the tax. A better solution would be to invest in nuclear. We should be having the conversation on what is the best way to encourage more nuclear power production across Canada. It is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669846">Today, the Liberals might be a little bit warm on nuclear; I know that many mistrust them in the industry, and it is for good reason. There is a long history of a lot of lip service from the Liberals but not a lot of the action that is required to fully fulfill the promise that is nuclear in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669847">We talked about the SDTC green slush fund the Liberals set up. Right now, we have such companies as Cameco and Westinghouse out of Saskatoon developing an eVinci microreactor that could be used in northern Canada to meet the electrical needs of industry or consumers, or for security. If we only had a government that believed in nuclear, it would have allowed an eVinci reactor to access some of those funds; instead, the funds went out the side door. Some funds went to the chair of the board itself. A Liberal insider gave money to herself, which is just horrendous when we know that there are solutions out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669848">There is great hope at Darlington with GE Hitachi and the SMRs. I am really excited to see how they come onto the grid scale. That is a technology that SDTC could have helped bring to market quicker; instead, the money went to Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669849">There is the CANDU reactor itself, the Canadian-owned pride of the nuclear world. Our contribution is CANDU. What could we do with that technology if, instead of utilizing the green slush fund for Liberal insiders, we actually invested in CANDU? Could members imagine, for the men and women who work on that reactor, the refurbishments and the supply chain, if we had a government that actually had common sense and used a fund like the SDTC not to get their friends rich, as the Liberals have done, but to invest in technology? That is where this has to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669850">We talked about waste. There is waste. Roughly, if we used nothing but nuclear electricity for our whole life, on average, it would be enough. The waste would be only one cupful. That is a concern. We have technologies for how we properly store that, but we do not have a proper way to recycle some of the other technologies out there. We know that solar panels are mostly created in China and shipped over to North America. They may be assembled on a structure or a house here, but that is not really helping the economy in great numbers. However, it is a technology that, in remote areas and for select grids, could provide a solution. I would say that the worst thing about it is that there is no way to recycle the panels, which are the waste that comes from solar. We have to compare that to alternatives, and we will get to nuclear waste in a minute. However, the panels are just buried. The leaching of the chemicals found in the solar panels is a real concern; we should be debating that, talking about it and figuring out how to fix it. For some of the other renewables, such as the blades on wind turbines, there is no way of recycling them. We dig a hole in the ground, put the blades in there and cover them up. That is the end of life for those renewables. It does not have to be that way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669851">How did nuclear get it right? There is a service charge embedded in our power rate. In Ontario, a portion of the rate we pay for that power goes into a fund that takes care of the waste. That sounds pretty good versus renewables. It is probably going to come down to the taxpayers or the environment that will pay if we rely solely on them. There has to be a balancing act. One is not better than the other in all circumstances, but for baseload power generation, there is nothing that beats clean, reliable nuclear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669852">The debate today is a bit about what we do with Chalk River. It has managed our nuclear research. It has facilitated breakthroughs in medical isotopes. The smartest people working on nuclear are working at Chalk River. They live in and around that area, upstream or downstream, and they know the positive impacts that the Chalk River laboratory has had on the environment, not just locally, but internationally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669853">Earlier we heard another speaker talk about the export of the CANDU technology, which is wonderful. We should be encouraging more of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669854"> I want to come back to the workers in nuclear and make this commitment to them. The new, common-sense Conservatives respect them and their technology, and we appreciate the work they do. We thank them for keeping the lights on. </ParaText>

The health effects of nitrogen dioxide pollution include increased inflammation of the airways, worsening coughs and wheezing, reduced lung function and increased asthma attacks. They are, in fact, all a group of gases that, when we burn fossil fuels like natural gas and diesel, are burned at high temperatures. NO2, CO2 and other nitrogen oxides occur in the air and contribute to particle pollution; indeed, those effluents, those exhausts, are yellow-brown in colour.

              <ParaText id="8669866">I want to talk about the environment, because the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> made an important announcement today about the much-vaunted cap on oil and gas emissions that which we have been waiting for for years. This is an old Liberal promise, and yet the oil and gas industry is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. The government also set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 38% to 43% by 2030. What is mind-boggling about today's announcement is that the emissions cap for the oil and gas industry will take effect only in 2030. How are we supposed to meet our 2030 targets if the most polluting industry only has to start making an effort to reduce its emissions in 2030?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669867">I just do not get it. Once again, the government is putting off taking action. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change cannot be serious. How many federal elections will there be between now and then? He may not even be Minister of Environment at that point. These are decisions that should have been made years ago. Once again, thanks to their lack of political courage, the Liberals have just punted the issue to future generations. It also undermines Canada's credibility on the international stage when the government fails to live up to its Paris commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669868">The topic we are discussing is the environment in general, but I want to get back to some very concrete concerns expressed by people who live near nuclear facilities. I find it interesting that the Liberals and Conservatives, who are both proud supporters of the nuclear industry, are not saying much about renewable energy. I am making a connection with today's announcement by the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>. Nuclear energy is not evil. It is a technology that is available. I love science, and it is absolutely fascinating that humans were capable of creating this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669869">However, the very concrete result is that it produces radioactive waste that cannot be dealt with and that will remain in the environment and in ecosystems for thousands of years. Why should we continue to produce energy that is highly polluting and potentially hazardous when we have much cleaner, greener renewable alternatives? That is what I do not understand. Is it stubbornness? There are other technologies, other ways of producing electricity and energy. Why not invest in them instead of having projects that are potentially dangerous for the public?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669870">Of course, I am talking about Chalk River and the plan to have a nuclear waste dump on the surface near a water table, very close to a river that supplies drinking water to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. These people are worried because if there were ever a leak or runoff, if the water ever became contaminated, it would be extremely harmful to people's health. There is widespread public opposition in the region from concerned citizens' groups, municipalities as well as the Algonquin first nations. As I said earlier, 10 out of the 11 communities oppose the project. I do not understand why the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission insists on going down this path when things could be done differently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669871">The Chalk River site is already problematic. Canada's first nuclear laboratory began operating there in 1952, and a huge amount of radioactive nuclear waste has already been stored in trenches in the ground, in aging facilities that were not designed for the long term.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669872">These facilities were meant to be temporary but were never replaced, so I can understand why people are even more concerned about what could happen in the future. These storage facilities do not meet today's international standards and obligations. Contaminants from the Chalk River laboratory have already been found in the Ottawa River. The thing that is truly worrisome is the government's decision to build a near surface dump and facility for nuclear waste despite opposition from first nations and despite the fact that this probably goes against the spirit of reconciliation with first nations and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. There are problems on many levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669873">In this report, the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development examined radioactive waste management. The NDP submitted a supplementary opinion because we agreed with some of the recommendations. There are some interesting things in the report, but a few things are also missing. One of the recommendations we support, of course, is that Canada comply with international standards. It is frankly astonishing that Canada, a G7 country, is not meeting the 2024 international standards for radioactive waste management. The least we can do is meet them. I learned that we are still not meeting them, and that is rather troubling.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8669898"> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the important issue before us. The NDP environment critic is under the weather at the moment. I wish she could be in my place, but I will try to do some justice to the file, which I have been working on in the Ontario region for quite some time, in the South Bruce region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669899">South Bruce has had proposals for the storage of nuclear waste facilities that have had complications because they have threatened the Great Lakes Basin system and international relations. It has been highly complex, and force has been thrust upon the community to make a decision. It has already said no to one project. Recently there was a referendum for another project that passed with only 51% in favour. Despite the fact that the project passed, the lobbying was intense and significant, and the voting process, I have to say, was rather suspect in the sense that no paper balloting was allowed and there were people who felt they could not get their vote. It passed with only 51% and, ironically, it still has to go through more hurdles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669900">Some of the proposals in the past have failed in other countries when it comes to nuclear waste. In fact, to go back to what I learned about it, an OPG scientist involved was a whistle-blower who talked about the proposal at that time to bury intermittent nuclear waste for the length of the CN Tower into the ground in Ontario, within about a kilometre of the Great Lakes Basin waterway system. The proposal to bury it in rock formations that were known to be suspect for containment and expect it to be there in safety and perpetuity, for over 100 million years, boiled down to a decision of the small community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669901">Ironically, in the past the Conservatives under Joe Clark, a Progressive Conservative, intervened. I was fortunate enough to be in the chamber when he was here. It was a much different Progressive Conservative Party than what we are faced with now, which is the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party becoming the Conservative Party. Clark was foreign affairs minister at the time and intervened in the U.S. decision, saying not to put nuclear waste next to our Great Lakes. That was lived up to, and now there is a series of letters from Congress members and Senate members in the United States who have been actively lobbying against Canada's proposal for another project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669902">The Chalk River project is similar to what South Bruce went through. Chalk River, of course, is by fresh water as well. It is very significant heritage-wise with first nations, similar to South Bruce. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization has been described as being the fox guarding the henhouse, but I think it is more significant than that because it is an active lobbying organization that gets deep-rooted into the communities. What is sad is that it divides communities with promises of a magical vision of how things will be versus what can and will take place afterward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669903">Ironically, successive Conservative and Liberal governments have tried to pass on the Nuclear Waste Management Organization as something they cannot touch or be involved in or that is independent, such as in the case that happened most recently, in October. There were 1,604 people who voted in favour of hosting a nuclear waste facility versus 1,526 who voted against it, to determine the outcome of the Great Lakes and its future should there be a failure or a problem. We need to think about the gravity of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669904">I have been in South Bruce several times over the years to meet with people there. I have met with Michelle and others who have very much done the right thing. They are farmers. What is not being said and what is always pushed against them as neighbour is pitted against neighbour are the issues that come up about whether their properties can even be used for the businesses they have right now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669905"> Some businesses, like the famous Chapman's ice cream business, will be opposed because, with U.S. export and import laws, there are different conditions that can actually be put on products that go into the United States and that have nuclear waste associated with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669906">There are also issues, as I have mentioned, for some of the farms, whether they be sheep farms, beef farms, dairy farms or other livestock farms. They could lose their insurance, or their insurance companies threaten them by saying that they are not sure whether they will insure them in the future. We are looking at some of the largest farm operations, significant businesses, and health. Even if there were never a problem, they would have consequences put on them, their families and the agricultural food industry, which is very significant in a practical, immediate term. Heaven forbid something else happens, as it would be long-term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669907">What is always put to the residents, which is insulting, is that they have to come up with the solution. There have been a couple of recent developments that have some elements that are new and different but that, in the history of storage of nuclear waste, have failed. We have gone through some really wild rides when it comes to nuclear waste. At times there were people who proposed putting it in rockets and sending it off into space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669908">There have been other times when nuclear waste machinery, equipment and so forth has been proposed to be shipped across the Great Lakes over to Europe for the waste to get processed and shipped back. It was said that the only concern people should have if they were standing on the shore is that they might get nuclear radiation similar to that from an X-ray. Heaven forbid that an accident or something else would take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669909">In addition, what nobody will talk about in the situation is the fact that we have to transport nuclear waste across communities. They focus specifically on the hosting communities and about lobbying supporting organizations, trying to get money into the hands of different projects that electorally are significant to people and so forth, to put pressure on winning the vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669910">I am concerned that winning the vote becomes the excuse, because it says to people and organizations, whether in Chalk River or South Bruce, “You asked for this”, which will be forever remembered. There is no funding or response of a “no” with regard to the situation of all the community organizations, no commitment there, so when the first one in South Bruce failed, they just moved over a little and another project emerged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669911">Yes, we have to deal with the storage of nuclear waste. I want to thank Bruce Power for having me there and allowing me to tour the facility and see it. It is independent because of the way Ontario has set up the system of the production of energy versus transmission and versus storage. However, we do not factor storage and treatment, the billions upon billions of dollars' worth, and the legacy, into the cost of nuclear energy. We just kick it down the road and expect somebody else to deal with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669912">What was amazing about the situation that I saw was the mere fact that there has been the expectation and the push placed on the residents to find a solution, dividing residents from one another, instead of there being the proper accountability that is necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669913"> I want to at least thank the committee for putting in some recommendations and shedding some light on this, but the reality is that nuclear energy is something of a legacy that still is not being treated responsibly.</ParaText>

Had the Liberals lived up to a proper policy on cap and trade, we would not have ever been in a carbon tax system, and the only reason we are in a carbon tax system in Ontario is that Doug Ford took us out of the cap and trade system, paid $2 billion to his industrial buddies for that, and now we are stuck with the carbon tax.

              <ParaText id="8669931">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to rise to address this issue in two ways. We all, or at least, the government and a number of other members, recognize the true value of nuclear power and having that discussion. Having said that, I am going to tag on to that after a few opening remarks about what I believe are legitimate concerns of Canadians about what is taking place in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669932">This report we are debating today has been around for a couple of years, but it was a decision made by the Bloc party to bring it forward. I suspect, as we have witnessed more and more concurrence reports being brought to the floor of the House of Commons, it is because members are upset with the Conservative Party and the multi-million dollar game the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is playing. That is the reason we are debating nuclear power today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669933"> I will be sharing my time, by the way, with one of my friends from the Bloc. This is a wonderful compromise, I must say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669934"> I received a letter from someone who has been mailing a number of members of Parliament. This email was a plea to all members of the House of Commons, and it was signed off by some very impressive groups that are in support of Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>. One might wonder why that is relevant; it is relevant because the Bloc has brought forward a motion. It brought forward that motion because of frustration with the Conservative game being played. As opposed to debating the game, members want to talk about the importance of the nuclear industry here in Canada. If everyone stopped playing the game and we dealt with the concerns Canadians have, like the concerns in the email I have received from a long list of organizations, we would actually talk about what it is they are asking us to deal with, and that is Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669935">The lengthy list of organizations includes the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the Association of School System Administrators, Children's Healthcare, Canadian Medical Association, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and Empowered Kids Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669936">What Canadians want us to be talking about is issues they know we can actually deal with, legislation that is before the House. Instead of dealing with that, we are talking about nuclear power. Nuclear power is an important issue, I do not question that. What I question is the motivation in the House to change the channel of what we should be dealing with. We should be dealing with issues Canadians want us to deal with, not the desires of the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> to become the prime minister or the filibustering the Conservatives do day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669937">That is something that I believe ultimately does need to be addressed. When I think of the issue of nuclear power, I think it is important for us to recognize that it does have a role to play as an industry. We hear a great deal about the benefits of nuclear power; I do not know to what degree people realize there are actually tens of thousands of Canadians directly employed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669938">We have two provinces, Ontario and New Brunswick, where nuclear power plays an important role in their economies and their communities as a whole. Ontario's consumption of nuclear power has increased over the years, as we have seen a shift away from emissions-sourced power generation to nuclear power generation. Ontarians have been a great beneficiary of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669939">Even though my province and the province of Quebec, which I care very much about, have hydroelectricity in common, and I support green energy sources, there is absolutely nothing wrong in recognizing that nuclear power does have a role here in Canada. We should recognize and support it. When people think of nuclear power, they often think of power stations and that is it, when in fact, we have all sorts of uses for nuclear technology out there and how it is developed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669940">I would encourage members to reflect on health care, whether it is isotopes or how radioactive materials ultimately advance medicine here in Canada, it is an area of technological advancement using science that will do wonderful things in medicine into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669941">I recognize many ways that Canada could lead the world. CANDU reactors have been of great benefit not only to Canada, but also outside of Canada, where we have seen other countries look to us to see how we have been successful at generating energy through nuclear power production with these small, modular reactors. We have the technology and the expertise for Canada to play a very strong leading role. It is interesting to see the Bloc and their opposition to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669942">Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> was the offshore wind energy legislation, which was huge for Atlantic Canada, and it is green energy. It is something the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government have put right up front through supporting legislation. Now we have Atlantic provinces that are bringing in, or have brought in, mirror legislation because we have recognized that it is not only better for our environment but also good for the economy and the communities in which we live.

              <ParaText id="8669958"> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Winnipeg North for agreeing to share his time with me. I especially thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278377" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation> for her leadership, her vision of a more pristine Quebec and Canada, and her commitment to bringing this debate forward today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669959">I rise to speak to the issue of nuclear waste and the fourth report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development on this topic. This is not the first time I have raised the issue of nuclear power here in the House. I have asked various ministers questions but none of them have offered us any answer about the botched consultations with first nations on establishing a near surface nuclear waste disposal facility along the shores of a vital waterway that supplies drinking water to cities like Gatineau and Ottawa, among others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669960">Last night, as I was leaving Témiscamingue, after taking part in the Remembrance Day ceremony, I drove back along the Ontario highway that goes through the Chalk River site where construction of a near surface nuclear waste disposal facility is planned, at the same location and in close proximity to Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, or CNL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669961">First, I cannot get over the fact that anyone can accept taking such a risk with drinking water. It makes no sense. It is a completely illogical decision. Why even consider burying nuclear waste near our drinking water source, which is so dear to our lives? Putting it at risk for highly toxic waste that we know can cause irreversible damage to our health and our environment is an absurdity that we cannot ignore. Neighbouring areas are home to precious biodiversity that could be irreparably damaged by this initiative. What a foreseeable mess. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669962">The Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs is currently studying Bill <Document DbId="12774114" Type="3">C‑61</Document>, a bill on first nations water. I hope someone will put an end to this very risky project and that the ministers will stop being wilfully blind and start committing to respecting the will of the Anishinabe and their land where they practice their culture. In fact, they came to committee to oppose the Chalk River project and I asked them whether they had any concerns about the drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669963">Having said that, there is also the issue of false indigenous claims, because that is what we are talking about here as well. In the pre-consultations, the government made room for “pretendians”. The government's actions have seriously harmed the Anishinabe people. It is inconceivable that, in 2024, no one is acknowledging this and we are still on the wrong track. The Algonquins of Ontario have no legitimacy to speak. These are Métis groups that are not currently recognized by law, and referring to them to build social licence is highly questionable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669964">Furthermore, as Canadian Nuclear Laboratories seeks to reassure the public that its storage mound will be secure, it is vital to remember that intermediate-level waste, while accounting for less than 2% of the volume, remains a major concern. This is waste that can last thousands of years, well beyond the promised monitoring period. We cannot afford to play games with the safety of our environment and our health for a project that, despite the technical promises, could have long-term consequences for our precious river. It is our duty to question and denounce this short-term vision, because the future of our region and its resources is at stake. We are talking about a one-million-cubic-metre reservoir of waste that they want to store right next to the Ottawa River, the <I>Kichi Sibi</I>, the <I>rivière des Outaouais</I>, which flows, let us not forget, just below Parliament Hill. This affects us directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669965">Second, it is in violation of UNDRIP. This declaration emphasizes the need for informed and respectful consultation with communities affected by such projects. We know that there has not been adequate or sufficient consultation. I was there in August 2023 when they opposed the project. More importantly, I was at the Supreme Court when they challenged the decision, precisely because they had not been consulted. I would like to commend the leadership of the Anishinabe community of Kebaowek, in my riding, whose ancestral lands include the Chalk River territory, and its chief, Lance Haymond.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8669966">There is a very worrisome pattern of overlap between the roles of the government, the private sector and the lobbyists. I would like someone to explain that strategy to us. People who were appointed by the Liberals and who worked for ministers under this government are the ones who are on the ground right now campaigning for the nuclear industry. I am talking about former Liberal candidates and advisers to the justice, environment, indigenous affairs and industry ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669967">The former commissioner is currently in Europe lobbying for her company. The chair of a ministerial advisory committee was appointed as president of the commission. What is more, he is the owner of a nuclear company. Today, Lou Riccoboni, a former Liberal ministerial adviser and public servant, is introduced on the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories website as the vice-president of corporate affairs and vice-president of business development at CNL.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669968">How much of taxpayers' money is being used to lobby ministers? He is a partner at Prospectus Associates, where he brags about assisting with procurement captures in the defence and nuclear sectors, including the first-ever government-owned, contractor-operated, or GoCo, management of Canadian Nuclear Laboratories. That is not all. He is also the president of Nexus Government Services, a lobbying firm described on its site as assisting international companies pursue, position, capture, and execute significant federal government procurements. Looks like this is a small world with many close friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669969">We have to ask questions and get to the bottom of things. The committee report is just the prelude to another scandal. The federal government is paying a consortium big bucks to manage its nuclear facilities, and the same consortium is lobbying the government to have its contract renewed. How much public money has been used to pay the salaries of these private industry executives so that they can lobby for big money? Did they disclose it on the lobbyist registry? No, they did not. When will there be real transparency? Honestly, the jig is up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669970">I am certain the Auditor General of Canada would be interested in Chalk River labs' contract renewal. Also, why is there such contempt for indigenous people? Why is hazardous material being moved to their land without notification? I would like someone to explain that to me. I look forward to seeing who is condoning everyone's actions in the House. On this side of the House, we have a talent for getting to the bottom of things and we will continue to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669971">We must question the transparency around this project. The contract for this waste site is about to be renewed without thorough review or open discussion in the House of Commons. This raises basic questions about the responsibility and diligence of our elected representatives. How could there have been no public discussion or democratic debate on an expense that exceeds the entire CBC/Radio-Canada budget, a considerable amount? It violates the very principle of transparency, whose implementation is long overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669972">Considering the recent declaration of bankruptcy by Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, which was also involved in an ambitious SMR project at the Chalk River lab, how much has the government already invested in this project and what financial risks did it take in pursuing its strategy of partnering on nuclear projects with the private sector? I hope the House gets some answers to these questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669973">In conclusion, I invite all my colleagues to reflect deeply on these troubling issues and facts. The Anishinabe people are not the only ones paying the price for political decisions designed to separate them from their ancestral territory at a time of reconciliation with indigenous peoples. There is nothing encouraging about this project, whether in terms of transparency, good governance or management of public funds. Above all, there are environmental questions that arise, and I am still convinced that there is no such thing as zero risk. Waste will not just appear there. It will be transported, and there will be risks at every stage of transportation. We know that water has already leaked from the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories site. In this case, the incident was not made public because the laws are too lax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8669991">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="304784" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation>. In fact, I am the warm-up act, because he is the great orator.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669992">I am very happy to participate in this debate on an energy source that Canada and the world need: nuclear energy. It helps supply us with energy, and God knows we need it. Nuclear energy is one of the five green energy sources that we on this side of the House have been promoting for years. Yes, we need to decarbonize, but we also need to have practical solutions, and nuclear energy is one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669993">On March 22, I visited the Chalk River facility. Like all Canadians, I had obviously heard about it. I had seen documentaries and news reports on it. There are some entirely valid and relevant concerns about the safety of this site, which, let us not forget, has been around for more than 80 years. It employs thousands of people and produces hundreds of millions of isotopes to help people overcome cancer. It is not a minor part of our history. It is not minor in terms of environmental impact, and it is not minor in terms of the impact on public health and applied health when it comes to treating cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669994">The question is where to put the nuclear waste. Let us not forget that the site itself has already had a place for storing nuclear waste for decades. Yes, it is very close to the research centre and lab, about a kilometre away. Yes, it is very close to a river. Because of its layout, this site has been protected, to a certain extent, for decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669995">That is why assessments have been carried out over the years since 2016. Atomic Energy of Canada conducted assessments and consulted with people across Canada, particularly those who live nearby, to see which locations were the most favourable. Approximately 15 locations were analyzed, and the assessment found that this is the best place to store the waste and continue processing it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669996">This finding is based on decades of experience and on the type of waste involved. We are not talking about nuclear bombs here. What we are talking about is used materials, like old wooden planks, coverings that had to be worn on certain visits, tools that people used while working in the research centres, or debris from buildings. This waste is no longer useful, but it was directly involved in production. Ninety per cent of it is low-level radioactive waste. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669997">I want to make a very clear distinction here. Low does not mean insignificant. On the contrary, it is very significant, but in this case, every possible measure has been taken for decades. It has not prevented incidents from happening. I will talk about that later. In general, however, overall, the situation at Chalk River is well managed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669998">Also, the waste centre will be located 50 metres above the river and 163 metres above sea level. It does not sit right on the river. It is also important to understand that this site has already been made safe, in a way. It has been extensively studied, and so has the water quality. Of course, there have been incidents, as I said earlier, but overall, it is considered to be the safest place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8669999">It is also important to note that some first nations are concerned, while others are less so. However, we have to look at the whole picture. There is an expression we sometimes use back home that relates to an idea that is currently going around, and that is “not in my backyard”. Most people do not want certain things in their backyard. However, the people in Chalk River who work there and are linked to the facility are not concerned about it. It is not everyone, but some people have lived there for generations and are not unhappy about the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670000">That is why we need to address this issue properly, seriously and rigorously. Yes, the drinking water is there. Yes, there have been incidents, but generally speaking, people are still able to drink the water there on a regular basis. As I said earlier, the Chalk River facility has been around for over 80 years. Millions of isotopes have been produced there. Nobel Prize winners have worked there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8670001">Chalk River is also the locus of Canada's nuclear energy development. For example, the CANDU reactor was developed there. Some regions of Canada, such as Ontario, which is not exactly a minor player in the Canadian Confederation, get 60% of their energy from nuclear power. Quebec once had expertise in nuclear power, but it was not successful, to say the least. The nuclear power plant in Quebec operated for a total of 183 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670002">Let us not forget that, in the early 1960s, when hydroelectricity was booming thanks to the very wise decisions made in the 1940s and 1950s and implemented in the 1960s, including the construction of the iconic Manic-5 generating station, the Lesage, Johnson and Bertrand governments considered the possibility of building a nuclear power plant. The decision to move forward was made in the early 1970s, but the primary focus was to be hydroelectricity and the James Bay megaproject. Need I remind members that some people wanted us to put that project aside and focus all of our efforts on nuclear power? Mr. Bourassa, the premier at the time, who, as we know, was willing to compromise, said that we were going to do both at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670003">Let us also not forget that, at the time, a certain person said that he was not against hydroelectricity, but that he thought that maybe Quebec was already producing enough. He said that it was not necessarily smart to erect a dam on every single Catholic French-Canadian river. The person who said that was none other than former premier Jacques Parizeau. He later changed his mind, as did the party he represented at the time. Yes, we have been down this road in Quebec. It did not produce the desired results, but we are currently reviewing nuclear energy in Quebec, and it is not impossible that, as some prominent politicians and energy stakeholders have said, perhaps within a few decades, we will need nuclear energy. We are therefore studying the possibility of reviving the Gentilly-2 plant, which, I should note, was shut down in 2010 or 2012, if memory serves. As I recall, I was one of the last politicians in Quebec City to defend nuclear energy, not in order to put all our eggs in one basket, but rather to open it up to everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670004">In closing, I would simply like to say a word about the history of Chalk River. As I said earlier, its story began in 1942, in the middle of a world war. On July 11, 1944, General de Gaulle, head of the provisional government of the French Republic, came here on a visit. He met with three French scientists who were working at Chalk River specifically to develop nuclear energy. As we know, later on, in 1945, that energy was used in warfare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670005">I would also like to mention a few historical events. On December 13, 1952, a major incident occurred at Chalk River, requiring an emergency response. Not that many people knew what nuclear energy was or how to handle it, so a dozen people were brought in from the United States, some of whom had worked on a nuclear submarine. The young lieutenant who led the clean-up efforts eventually rose through the ranks to reach the highest office in his nation, becoming president of the United States. The person who responded to the incident at Chalk River in 1952 was none other than Jimmy Carter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670006">In closing, we are fully aware that nothing is perfect and that every form of energy has its challenges and risks. However, after more than 80 years in operation, after enabling millions of people around the world to beat cancer thanks to the isotopes produced at Chalk River, we feel that we have good track record overall. It can be improved, but it is good overall. After studying this for nearly eight years and evaluating some 15 potential sites, we feel that this is the right choice. We have to say yes to Chalk River. We have to have this disposal facility for very low-level radioactive waste.</ParaText>

It is because Ontario has no reservations about its energy needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670008">That will cost it dearly later on, because it is choosing nuclear power. However, Quebec is the one that is going to bear the brunt of the risks Ontario is taking. If the Chalk River site has a spill or something, five million Quebeckers who live down the Ottawa River could suffer the consequences. My colleague trusts the experts, but I would remind him that it was experts who downgraded Chalk River and, according to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, they are industry people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8670026"> Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here listening to the Bloc Québécois, the NDP and the Green Party spread anti-nuclear energy propaganda, attacking an industry that is part of my community and that means jobs and energy in my community. I am very happy to stand here and correct the record. Durham is home to the Darlington nuclear facility. We are home to members of the Power Workers' Union and UA Local 401, the hard-working men and women who put their time and energy into powering our region and powering our province. To sit here and listen to the Bloc Québécois and their buddies in the other parties spread anti-nuclear messaging is mind-blowing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670027">They go to great lengths to promote a conflict between economic growth and environmental stewardship. We would think they would respect an industry proving that those two things are not at odds with one another. In fact, we are proving, locally in Durham and in the nuclear industry across Canada, that we can pursue economic growth and environmental stewardship hand in hand. Instead of appreciating that and celebrating the hard-working men and women who make that possible, we are getting slander from the other parties of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670028">Let me be very clear. The Bloc Québécois has, through its dissenting report, tried to couch this as some sort of generational issue. I will quote from its introductory paragraph: “The Canadian governance of radioactive waste raises important issues that will have a significant impact on future generations.” Let us talk about those future generations. Let us talk about the young people in our country right now who are proving that we can pursue economic growth and environmental stewardship hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670029">I would like to share what someone from the North American Young Generation in Nuclear said, a constituent of mine, Matthew Mairinger. He said very clearly that nuclear energy has the lowest CO2 emissions by energy source and the highest capacity factor, operates 24-7, has among the lowest land footprints per energy produced and provides well-paying, stable careers for those in the community. As a young professional supporting nuclear energy, he feels it is one of the best ways he is helping society move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670030">This is from a young man who works in the nuclear energy industry, but he is far from alone. The data shows that the nuclear industry generates over $2 billion in labour income and $2.5 billion in direct and secondary economic activity annually in this country. The sector also contributes $1.5 billion in tax revenue to federal and provincial governments, accounting for approximately 89,000 jobs nationwide. This goes back to the young people of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670031">Do members know that around 40% of the workers in the nuclear industry are under the age of 40? This is a young industry made up of hard-working people who believe that economic growth and environmental stewardship go hand in hand. That is why it is very important that we stand for this industry, not just because of my local economy in Durham, but because of what these young people are doing for the country as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670032">When Bloc Québécois members say they are very concerned about future generations, pretending that this is some generational battle, they are not looking at the math, they are not looking at the facts and there are not looking at the stats, which show that this industry is creating opportunity for young men and women all across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670033">I would like to continue with some additional points about the environmental impact of the nuclear industry. Over 180 private sector suppliers, 95% of which are based in Canada, benefit from international nuclear projects that utilize Canadian intellectual property and manufactured goods. All the concerns that Bloc members are pretending to have about the environment are easily dismissed when we factor in the worldwide effect of Canadian energy. That is not just nuclear, but in this case, we are going to emphasize nuclear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670034">We are making it easier for countries all around the world to displace high-emission sources of energy with clean Canadian energy. The Bloc wants to pit nuclear against other forms of energy as if we are all competing. The reality is that the menu of options that Canada can give the world so it can have cleaner energy sources is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670035">I want to emphasize once again that the hard-working men and women in the nuclear industry, including in my home community of Durham, deserve strong advocacy at the federal level. They deserve a strong voice shining a light on all the wonderful work they are doing every day, including to power places like where we stand right now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8670043">I rise for the 55th time on behalf of the people of Swan River, Manitoba, to present a petition on the rising rate of crime. The community of Swan River is struggling with the rising rate of crime in the area. Statistics Canada reports that after nine years of the Liberal government, violent crime has risen by over 50% and gang-related homicides have nearly doubled. Within the last five years, the town's crime severity index has increased by over 50%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670044">The people of Swan River see the devastating effects this crime has on the community's safety and economic stability. The people of Swan River are calling for jail not bail for violent repeat offenders. The people of Swan River demand that the Liberal government repeal its soft-on-crime policies that directly threaten their livelihoods and their community. I support the good people of Swan River. </ParaText>

In fact, we have extremely weak ones, if anything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670049">Petitioners are calling on the government to develop enforceable federal standards to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of ship recycling that meet or exceed those set out in the EU ship recycling regulations, provide assistance through loans or grants to long-term reputable ship recycling companies that are closed-contained in a floating dry dock to facilitate implementation of new federal standards into their operations, and develop a strategy for recycling end-of-life for federally owned marine vessels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670050">Petitioners cite the significant risk to workers and the environment associated with ship recycling due to the presence of a wide variety of hazardous materials in end-of-life marine vessels. Also, unlike other jurisdictions, Canada lacks standards on ship recycling and unregulated ship recycling activities, which are putting our oceans, coastal communities like where I live on Vancouver Island and workers at risk. The lack of domestic oversight of ship recycling and the disposal of end-of-life marine vessels frustrates Canada's ability to ensure compliance with its international obligations under the Basel Convention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8670054">Mr. Speaker, it has been a month that the House has been at a complete standstill, paralyzed in the business of looking out for Canadians and of actually solving the problems that the House should be seized with. It may not be the worst news in the world. Certainly, many want to see the government take a walk after nine years; I hope Canadians can finally decide to send the government packing in a soon-to-come carbon tax election. Therefore, it may not be the worst thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670055">After nine years of the government and its destructive policies, we have been at a standstill for a brief while. The government of the day, the Liberals and their NDP counterparts, can no longer ruin the lives of Canadians even more than they have, at least in the short term. In nine years, the government has doubled the cost of housing and rent. It has doubled a mortgage payment in this country over the course of the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670056">We have inflation and interest rates burning out of control because of the government's irresponsible spending. We do not have a revenue problem in this country; we have a spending problem. The Liberal government spends more than it has on things we do not want or need. Two million people are eating from a food bank in a single month. Hundreds of tent cities are popping up in Toronto and all across the country, from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670057">We have crime, drugs, chaos and disorder in our streets. There are violent offenders turned out on bail as soon as they commit a crime. We saw this weekend, in Toronto, a scene from what seemed to be a movie. Police were chasing down criminals who stole a car, who hurt a police horse, who put citizens shopping on a weekend at risk and who ruined a business, all to find out that these culprits were out on bail because of the government's weak bail policy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8670069">Mr. Speaker, we know that with fraud, many people have not come forward because they felt the stigma, the shame and the embarrassment of dealing with fraud. It is like dealing with mental health. We need to do a better job to change the public's outlook when it comes to sharing about fraud because fraud is happening, and it is sophisticated. It is happening because of organized crime, which is using highly sophisticated devices and attitudes to go after vulnerable people. I am going to talk a little bit about that tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670070"> Recently, a senior in my riding, Peggy Christian from Courtenay, was scammed out of $100,000, her life savings. She was tricked into making wire transfers in huge amounts to scammers from Thailand, while her bank, Coast Capital Savings on Vancouver Island, did not have the protocols or the safeguards in place to protect Peggy. Peggy, who was 76 at the time, had been with Coast Capital Savings for more than 30 years. She had never gotten any transfers like this, and it should have been caught. Now, Peggy has had to sell her house and cut her costs in half just to stay above water, and her bank and the Canadian government have failed to return what she has lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670071">This is a heartbreaking story that should never have happened. We know that, often, when Canadians are victimized by scams, the Canadian government punishes the victim, not the perpetrator, and I am going to tell a story about that as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670072">In 2022, Canadian investors, as members have probably heard, were swept into what has been described as a more than $300-million Ponzi scheme, allegedly perpetrated by Greg Martel. Many of those investors, who come from all walks of life, are struggling to move on from their losses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670073">One of my constituents, Lana McKenzie, invested in that Ponzi scheme. She was already hurting from the scam, and she was actually hit again when the the CRA taxed her based on the fraudulent T5s that Lana had received from the scammer himself. Ever since then, Lana has been fighting for fairness from the CRA, but the federal government, instead of acting swiftly, has been moving incredibly slowly on Lana and other victims' objections at a time when many of those victims are already financially vulnerable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670074">They are living with the shame, but have come forward with courage, and I applaud them for having the courage to come forward. At the same time, we have seen no evidence that the federal government is working to return the alleged perpetrator, Greg Martel, from overseas, so he can face justice. Much of that stolen money has never been returned, and the government has not used the levers through Interpol to go after him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670075">We know that online fraud is impacting more and more Canadians. In 2022, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre reported that it had observed $530 million in reported victim losses. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre also received nearly 91,000 reports from Canadians that same year. According to the RCMP, fraud was the second largest contributor to the severity of crime last year. The rate of fraud, in 2023, went up by 12% and the rate of extortion went up by 35%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670076"> It should not be so easy for Canadians to get scammed, and it should not be so hard for victims to recoup their losses. The government needs to do a lot more. We need to make sure that the banks, which benefit from these illegitimate transactions, are being held to account as well. We can look at the recent case of TD in the U.S., which allowed criminal activity because it profited from them. In fact, Merrick Garland, the U.S. attorney general, said, “TD Bank created an environment that allowed financial crime to flourish. By making its services convenient for criminals, it became one.” That is how bad it is getting.</ParaText>

Before I start, I would like to extend my sympathies to Peggy, who has experienced this fraud in her life. I have had constituents in my riding as well who have lost sizable amounts of their life savings to these heartless scammers. It is a disgusting practice and we certainly need to find solutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670078">We carry these little devices around in our pockets now and take for granted that we can achieve so much on that phone. However, for people who are less familiar with that technology, because it has just been in the last 5% or 10% of their lives that it has become commonplace to have a very high-powered computer in their pocket with the capacity of going into their bank account and everything, it is intimidating. I think the onset of that technology has caused a lot of harm across our society with respect to seniors and fraudulent activity. Therefore, I offer my condolences to the member's constituent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670079">Fraudulent telephone calls are a significant source of concern for Canadians. They are not just annoying but very damaging as well. That is why our government continues to take concrete actions to combat these crimes. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Canada's national independent telecommunications regulator, has developed a series of requirements for industry to combat fraudulent telecommunications and help protect Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670080">The CRTC works with telecommunications companies to block incoming scam calls. For example, the CRTC approved a proposal from Bell Canada to permanently implement a call-blocking solution that uses artificial intelligence to prevent scam calls originating from outside of Canada from ever reaching Canadians. I am happy to share that from January 2020 to November 2023, this program prevented over 1.6 billion calls from reaching Canadians. That is a large number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670081"> The CRTC also requires service providers to block calls when the originating phone number does not conform to a standard numbering plan, a common sign of a fraudulent call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670082"> Furthermore, the CRTC is also working to improve a call traceback solution used to trace unsolicited calls back to their point of origin. As part of this process, in late February, the CRTC launched public consultations to identify solutions to particular operational issues with the traceback process. We know this approach to combatting fraud calls requires close collaboration with industry, tech leaders and experts. The CRTC is also working with industry to alert Canadians if an incoming call might be part of a scam. This approach, known as STIR/SHAKEN, works by notifying Canadians whether an incoming call originates from a real number. While it is not currently possible to authenticate all incoming calls, this approach will become more effective as telecom companies upgrade their networks and more Canadians use telephones that work with this approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670083"> Beyond the initiatives taken by the CRTC, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Competition Bureau are responsible for the enforcement of activities. Their work is facilitated by that of the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, which is jointly operated by the RCMP, the Ontario Provincial Police and the Competition Bureau, which enables law enforcement agencies to investigate complex fraud schemes by collecting information on fraud-related issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670084"> The government is also taking steps to enhance the quality of information on fraud in Canada by improving the processes by which Canadians can report fraud. For example, the National Cybercrime Coordination Centre and the CAFC are developing a new national crime and fraud reporting system to improve the processes used to report fraud and cybercrime incidents to law enforcement. It is expected to be fully operational in the coming months and will help improve the quality of data on fraud in Canada, as well as making it easier for Canadians to report fraud. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670085">The Government of Canada will always work to protect Canadians. It will continue to use the tools at its disposal to combat these crimes, but it goes without saying that it has to do more. It has to protect seniors. They are most commonly the victims of these crimes and I am in favour of any action to do that.</ParaText>

Bell, Rogers and Telus need to be held accountable for being a portal to crime and the CRTC needs to do much more. We know the Conservatives are not going to go after those big players. It is high time the Liberals hold them to account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8670089">Mr. Speaker, in my opening, I went as fast as I could to get through the eight pages of details on all the actions this government has taken. As to the 1.6 billion calls that were prevented, we have all experienced the duct cleaning calls and the CRA scam calls. Fortunately, most young people have the wherewithal just to hang up, but victims are increasingly seniors who are unfamiliar with technology. We have to do more, there is no doubt, but the long list of actions taken is already having results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670090"> The outcomes are pretty good, but Canada's telecommunications regulator will continue to work with the industry to develop technical solutions to combat these criminals. The member is right that the banking sector has an obligation to do more as well. We also have to educate Canadians about the dangers of online scams and all the progress on the countermeasures that are under way. Education goes a really long way. I know the Milton Public Library does a lot to educate seniors, so I encourage more people to be cautious and diligent.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8670091">Mr. Speaker, I am picking up on a question that I asked on World Environment Day, June 5 every year. On June 5, 2024, I asked the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> how they could reconcile claiming to want to protect the endangered southern resident killer whale while also expanding the activities that we know put the survival of that species at risk. The activities I specifically mentioned were the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is now developed, paid for and owned by the Trans Mountain Corporation, a Crown corporation. This means the people of Canada had to spend $34 billion to expand a pipeline that had not been approved by the first nations over whose territory it crossed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670092"> I note that earlier today, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> claimed that the first nations along the route were compliant, but that does not meet UNDRIP because it sure was not done with free or prior consent. It was often after the fact that the Trans Mountain Corporation, now a Canadian Crown corporation, coerced nations into signing agreements, saying that since they could not stop the pipeline, they might as well sign so it could give them some money. As described by other first nations, this has amounted to economic smallpox, referring to smallpox in blankets in the first wave of colonial settlement on this continent of Turtle Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670093">I also noted in my question that the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline has vastly increased the traffic noise of tankers and the risk of tanker accidents involving dilbit, which cannot be cleaned up in a marine environment. In fact, recently, Simon Fraser University found that since the pipeline's completion, the increase in tanker traffic has been tenfold. That is one of the most severe risks to the survival of the southern resident killer whale, and when a spill occurs, the damage to all marine species is incalculable . I also noted in my question that the expansion of the Roberts Bank terminal in the port of Vancouver is a direct threat to the survival of the southern resident killer whale as well as other species, including the western sandpiper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670094"> The response I got from the parliamentary secretary at the time mentioned a number of commitments that I do not think are at all sufficient for the climate crisis, but were not responsive to the fundamental question of how we think we can protect the southern resident killer whale, which the government is bound to do by the Species at Risk Act, while vastly increasing the threats to that very species. When I asked the question on June 5, I referenced that there are only 75 whales left in that population. Since then, the number has declined. We now have 73 southern resident killer whales left. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670095">I want to again thank the local volunteer groups that work so hard on this, particularly the southern Gulf Islands whale sighting network, which keeps a close eye on the number of vessels violating the rules, like recreational vessels coming too close to the whales and commercial vessels violating the interim protocols that were supposed to be created for sanctuaries in the areas of most critical habitat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670096"> To the hon. <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> and to everyone in the government, if there is any concern for the survival of the species, the government has to pay attention to reducing noise, reducing the volume of vessels and prosecuting those who violate the protocols and the distance requirements to save our whales.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8670097"> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> for her advocacy for killer whales tonight. I know that she has been a steadfast champion of mammals that do not vote. It is important to recognize that many aspects of our environment depend on us to be their stewards and their stakeholders. Killer whales are very intelligent animals, but obviously they do not have the right to cast a ballot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670098">Back in 2019, the Government of Canada announced an enhanced recovery strategy for the southern resident killer whale population. Environment and Climate Change Canada and three other federal partners took measures to help with the conservation and recovery of this population. This specific group of orcas, the southern resident killer whales, faced a triple threat of pollution, declining numbers of the chinook salmon that they feed on, and acoustic and physical disturbances from busy shipping lanes and other marine activity. This is not new, but it is undeniably urgent. That is why our government is taking action through an enhanced recovery strategy. This past spring and for the last six years, the federal government announced the implementation of new seasonal measures and funding to protect these whales, restore their population and conserve the health of their food sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670099"> Environment and Climate Change Canada continues to fund and support the chemicals management plan. This is one of several pollution prevention initiatives that have implemented measures and allowed enforcement officials to intervene to protect the killer whales and the environment from harmful pollutants. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670100">In addition, new approaches and innovations are changing how we ship goods through the waters, and Canada's marine safety system must also evolve to continue to protect Canadians and the environment. Last summer, the <Affiliation DbId="311722" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> announced the passage of Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, which took budget funds and allocated them to specific oceans protection measures and we created better compensation for communities that would feel the impact in the event of a hazardous substance spill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670101">Canada's oceans protection plan strengthens marine safety within our waters, and we now have vastly faster responses to emergencies, such as marine firefighting and emergency towing. The vessels that travel to the Trans Mountain terminal in Burnaby, British Columbia are monitored and must adhere to strict safety and incident regulations because our government is committed to protecting our waters. Canada targets problem vessels. There is a fund and a protocol in place to remove hazards to navigation and to wildlife, and these measures were created in response to feedback from indigenous peoples, stakeholders, Canadians and I imagine some of the whale-sighting volunteers that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> mentioned, as well. We all agree that the oceans are hurting, and the protection of our oceans is a national priority. It is in everyone's best interest to advance this federal government's oceans protection plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670102">We stand with all Canadians in our love of these B.C. orcas and the natural environment around us, and we stand behind the protections that we have written into Canadian law. Together, we walk a delicate line between preserving biodiversity and species at risk, tackling climate change and keeping our economy evolving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670103">With the remaining time, I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary work on this subject that Senator Murray Sinclair did. He was a steadfast advocate for whales, dolphins and other marine mammals, particularly when they were being held in captivity for entertainment. We lost Senator Murray Sinclair today. Canada is a poorer nation without his mind and advocacy, but we are so much richer for his many contributions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8670104"> Mr. Speaker, thanks to the hon. <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> for the reference to the late and extraordinary Judge Murray Sinclair, who was the sponsor in the Senate of the bill I took through the House of Commons to ban the keeping of whales in captivity. He will be deeply missed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670105">In the 45 seconds I have left, let me just say to the <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> that the Southern Gulf Islands Whale Sighting Network is documenting increasing intrusions and violations that affect the southern resident killer whales. Things are getting much worse, and no matter how many press releases the Liberals issue, it is not affecting the numbers of southern resident killer whales because we are not enforcing our laws. With the increased numbers of tankers and the commitment to expand the Roberts Bank Terminal, we are going in the opposite direction of what the whales need. If there ever were a spill, no matter how fast the emergency vessels could get there, all I can imagine is that they would stand on the side and weep because we have no technology to clean up a dilbit spill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8670106">Mr. Speaker, once again I would like to thank the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands for her extraordinary work on the file, which goes back many, many years if not more than a decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670107">As the new Canadian clean-energy economy matures and oil and gas pollution measures are made toward Canada's net-zero target, stricter controls on protecting our waters and marine life are absolutely critical. In the event of a spill, there is a faster and better emergency response, and there is better compensation for all types of harvesting impacted, from fishing and hunting to the gathering of indigenous traditional medicines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670108">Canada is transforming its economy incrementally, but I would also like to be optimistic in the hopes we never have to endure such a horrible event. Oil spills are really a disgusting event of capitalism and dependence on shipping fossil fuels across the ocean. I saw an infographic recently about how far fewer ships would be necessary if we did not send fossil fuels across the ocean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8670109">Our government is committed to protecting our natural wonders, and I thank the member from the Green Party for her advocacy.</ParaText>
