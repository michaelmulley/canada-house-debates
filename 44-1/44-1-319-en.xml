              <ParaText id="8426682">She said: Mr. Speaker, under the radical and extremist Liberal-NDP government, our hospitals, once sanctuaries of care and safety, have become infested with chaos, drugs and weapons. In B.C. specifically, we have heard countless reports from the B.C. Nurses' Union of staff being exposed to fentanyl and meth smoke in their workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426683">A nurse on Vancouver Island was exposed to hard drug smoke at work. The exposure was so bad that she required emergency care and was told to stop breastfeeding her baby. In April, five nurses on one shift all had to be treated in emergency due to fentanyl smoke exposure. This is at a time when we have an urgent shortage of nurses, patients waiting for OR time and cancer patients being sent to Washington state for treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426684">This is the reality after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426685">Doctors and nurses should feel safe at work. Vulnerable patients should not be concerned about the presence of dangerous weapons while they are receiving care in our hospitals. This is common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426686">That is why I am introducing the safe hospitals act. This act would toughen sentences for criminals who bring weapons into hospitals to ensure the punishment fits the serious crime that it is. This act would also ban ministers of the Crown from granting an exemption to allow open, unsupervised and unprescribed hard drug use in hospitals. It is common-sense legislation to protect doctors, nurses and patients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426687">I look forward to this bill receiving the unanimous support of all parties. It will stop the crime and the chaos.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8426690">The petitioners are citing that the Liberals have an obligation to prevent genocide.

They know that a Speaker of the House, being a member of Parliament, must do the basics necessary to attempt to be re-elected in their constituency. They must do the basics required of them by their political party. They must do the basics required of them as a regional member of Parliament and a representative of the place they come from. The Conservatives think no one sees that, but people, of course, can understand it.</ParaText>

It used to be that when the Speaker was elected, we moved on with our business, debating the issues of the day with a back-and-forth, the various issues that come before us. Instead, the Conservatives try every day to disrupt our work by showing disrespect. We are not allowed to stand, for example, when the Speaker is standing. However, the Conservatives, led by their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, will stand up in defiance of the Speaker. They will speak over the Speaker.

              <ParaText id="8426732"> If the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons enjoys bashing the Conservatives for attacking the Speaker, this is a false debate.

While he was Speaker, he not only attended a fundraiser in his riding but also went to the neighbouring riding of Regina—Wascana and attended a fundraiser. There is documented evidence of it. I have tried to table it in the House of Commons before. There are pictures of him at that fundraiser but, of course, Conservatives would never let me do that.</ParaText>

I can only explain it with the word “hypocrisy”. It is the same hypocrisy that has a member vote against a housing program and then go and announce the results in her riding. Conservative members do this all the time. They put this stuff on repeat. They come here to obstruct, delay, insult and offend, but they do not offer one single idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426761">I urge those who are watching us today to watch and listen closely. Is there a single alternative offered by the Conservatives that helps them in their day-to-day life? That is what we are trying to propose. That is what we are trying to move to, so we can get to work on things such as pharmacare, dental care, expanding the rural rebate on the price of pollution; these are things that put money in the pockets of Canadians. Those are the things that we are going to be talking about later today if these Conservatives would just get out of the way.</ParaText>

That is the first point I wanted to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426764"> Second, the party in power keeps saying that we are unable to pass bills, yet it is the party in power that is responsible for setting the legislative agenda. It is the party in power that decided to call an election after two years. If bills are being delayed, it is not because we do not want to work. It is because we have a Speaker who is not doing his job properly and who obviously lacks judgment. In addition, he is partisan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426765"> It is also because the Liberals decided to slow down the process by calling an election and mismanaging government business.</ParaText>

Right-wing parties seek to create chaos and to create disorder.

              <ParaText id="8426774">The fact that is people do have a say. They do not have to listen to the Conservative nonsense, where what is okay for them back in the day is no longer okay. Respect for institutions must be rigidly enforced when the Conservatives are in the chair and they are in power, but respect for institutions must not be enforced at any other time. This is the playbook we are seeing across the world. It is the playbook we are seeing in the United States, and it is a shame that Conservatives are engaging in it here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8426795">Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in this place to address a question of privilege that has been raised with regard to the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker's</Affiliation> public display of partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426796"> Of course, we know that the Speaker of this place occupies a position of trust. We know that within that position of trust, he is supposed to function in an impartial manner. He is supposed to apply the rules in this place equally to all members of all parties. When he functions in a partisan capacity, however, he then betrays the trust those who occupy a seat within the House of Commons. He goes beyond the scope of his role and actually uses it then for the benefit of his political party, in this case the Liberal Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426797">The events that I am talking about are several in nature, but the latest one was “A Summer Evening with the Honourable [<Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>]”, said the announcement. This was a fundraiser that was hosted just across the river in Quebec, or deemed to be hosted just across the river in Quebec, and this invitation was sent out, drawing attention to the Speaker as the keynote. However, this is not the first time. This is the latest event that brings us to the House, calling for the Speaker's resignation or calling for a vote to remove him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426798">Before this, there was a cocktail fundraiser dinner that was hosted just a couple of months ago where, again, he was used as the keynote of this address or this function, and, of course, as Speaker, he was promoted, again in a partisan fashion, and used as an individual who could help elicit funds for the Liberal Party of Canada, and that is not all. There is a third one that I would like to draw the House's attention to, which is that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> actually, in his full outfit, jet setted to Washington and addressed the audience that he was given there. He talked about his time as a young Liberal, and in a very partisan fashion, in his address to the audience that was in front of him. That is his third strike. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426799">However, there are two more that I would like to draw the House's attention to, for a total of five within just the last few months of him being <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426800">In this place, there was an interaction that took place between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. The Prime Minister exchanged words, or used words to accuse the official opposition of being a “spineless” leader. In retort, the Leader of the Opposition responded with words that were similar. The Speaker of the House said nothing to the Prime Minister, but then went on to kick out the member of the official opposition, again pointing to a partisan decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426801">There is a fifth incident that I would like to draw attention to; that is that I myself was removed from this place. I was removed from this place because I used these words toward the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>. I said that he was, “acting in a disgraceful manner.” I was asked by the Speaker of the House to withdraw my words, which I rose from my seat and I said, “I withdraw”. However, the Speaker went on to kick me out of the House, not just for a little while but actually for the remainder of the day, therefore robbing the constituents of Lethbridge from having a vote in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426802"> It is the practice of the House, and it is in fact according to the Standing Orders, that should a member stand in her place and withdraw those words, she should be allowed to stay. However, the <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Speaker</Affiliation>, functioning in a partisan capacity, removed me. If those blues are looked at, it is very clear that I said, “I withdraw”. It is in the official record of the House. If the audio is listened to, Madam Speaker, you can hear me say those words “I withdraw”. It is clear within the audio record of the House. However, when it came to the Hansard, which is signed off by the Speaker's office, those words, “I withdraw”, were conveniently removed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426803">Therefore, there is already another question of privilege before this place, which is to say, why were those words removed? Why did the Speaker's office sign off on official Hansard records that removed my withdrawal?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426804"> In this place, the <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Speaker</Affiliation> must function in a trusted capacity. He must respect the members of this place. He must never be partisan in nature, nor should records ever be officially changed based on what is convenient for him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426805">Based on his conduct over these five incidents, we are asking for his resignation and if not, then we would like to remove him through a vote. </ParaText>

Once, we voted for 36 hours straight and, another time, for several hours. On one occasion, we voted in the House to pick which Conservative MP was going to speak instead of another.

              <ParaText id="8426830">To get back to the serious point at hand, we have stood in this chamber and given many speeches over the past three or four years, some that were very much unprecedented, but they all circled around one thing, which is the lack of respect for democracy the NDP-Liberal government has. I remember standing in this place during the “freedom convoy”, when the Emergencies Act was enacted, which was ruled unconstitutional. The NDP-Liberal government had zero respect for the rights of Canadians then, and now has zero respect for the institution we stand in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426831">The <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Speaker</Affiliation> has shown time and again that he lacks the judgment to have the honourable role of being Speaker. His judgment comes from his overt partisanship. We have seen it before. After the 2015 election, we saw the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have a tantrum because a vote was not happening. This is the amazing part. The New Democrats are holding the Speaker up when he was the apologist for the Prime Minister, as he went to the mic and defended the Prime Minister after he elbowed a female NDP member because the vote was not happening soon enough. That is unbelievable. Now they are going to be complicit in the vote trying to hold up the Speaker and to allow him to maintain his role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426832">We know that many times the <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Speaker</Affiliation> has spoken for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> after the countless things the Prime Minister has done that were unethical. When he wore blackface, the Speaker stood up for him as the then parliamentary secretary. His partisanship is well documented going back to when he was with the Liberal Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426833">I am not saying it is not okay to be partisan, but if people know deep down that they are that partisan and they put the Liberal Party above all else, they should not apply for the role of Speaker of the House of Commons, because we know that that role is to maintain decorum and to treat every MP in this House fairly and without prejudice.

She stood up and apologized on record and on video. We could hear her withdraw her remarks. She stood up and apologized for the remarks, and the Speaker still kicked her out. Do members think that is non-partisan? Do members think that is fair? The question I would ask every member in this House is this: Would he have done that if it was a Liberal or one of his junior partners, an NDP MP? The answer is no, he would not. He kicked out the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">official Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, and I believe this is the first time that has happened in this chamber, for making very similar remarks to those of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.

This is all about the Speaker and his wanting to make headlines, and actually continue to do the PMO's bidding. I have been in this chamber and in the legislative chamber and have seen many Speakers. This is similar to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, as we both served in the legislature and both served in the House of Commons. I have seen lots of Speakers in my time, and the interesting thing is that, by far, I have seen the most degradation of decorum in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426843">One thing I have learned in my life, and it is something that holds true, is that attitude reflects leadership. The Speaker is the leader of the House, and that is why some people have taken to the attitude they have, because the Speaker has no business in that chair. He has dishonoured that chair, and for that reason, it makes it an absolute mockery that the NDP members are going to prop up this Speaker as the junior coalition partner and are going to stand and defend a Speaker who defended the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> elbowing one of their female members. That is the respect the NDP now has for this place, in the House of Commons, and it is troubling. </ParaText>

I know for sure the Conservatives have lost confidence, the Bloc has lost confidence and some of the Liberals have lost confidence. They may not say it, but behind closed doors they do. It is actually unbelievable that they will continue to try to fight for this Speaker when he has dishonoured the job. It is time for him to go. He should resign before we have the vote. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8426875">I have been here for almost 20 years. I love this institution.

We see the government trying to deflect and protect the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>, who has now been found in a prima facie case of privilege on multiple occasions, and defend that behaviour. To me, that is disappointing to say the least. I am disgusted by it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426876">I am such a parliamentary nerd. I read the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>. We are on the third edition. I started off reading when it was O'Brien and Bosc, and now I am reading Bosc and Gagnon. I make sure that I read through the book at least once every session. At the beginning of every parliamentary sitting, in the fall, I reread chapter 20 in particular, but always chapter 3 as well because of committee operations and the work that we do. I am a vice-chair and I have to sit in committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426877"> In chapter 3, which is on parliamentary privileges and immunity, the very first page says, “The rights accorded to the House and its Members to allow them to perform their parliamentary functions unimpeded are referred to as privileges or immunities.” The <Affiliation DbId="279182" Type="96">Deputy Speaker</Affiliation> found in the case of the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation> that he has violated members' privileges, a prima facie case that he violated our privileges. What did he violate? His impartiality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426878"> In chapter 7 titled, “The Speaker and Other Presiding Officers of the House”, under “Impartiality of the Chair”, on page 323, it states, “When in the Chair, the Speaker embodies the power and authority of the office, strengthened by rule and precedent. He or she must at all times show, and be seen to show, the impartiality required to sustain the trust and goodwill of the House.” That is why the Speaker is now in trouble, because he has not been able to maintain that impartiality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426879">In fact, we have seen, on multiple occasions, we are talking six or seven times now, that the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation> has been called out, caught and charged for not acting impartial.

              <ParaText id="8426880"> On page 317, it says, “It is the responsibility of the Speaker to act as the guardian of the rights and privileges of Members and of the House as an institution.” It goes on to say the following:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8426882">When we talk about impartiality and when we talk about preserving our freedom of speech, we have the case we are dealing with right now. The Speaker held a fundraiser. It is not that he held a fundraiser that was in error because all of us, as parliamentarians, have to raise money to be able to fight elections. The<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation> has that right.

              <ParaText id="8426883">However, what was wrong in this case is that the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation>'s electoral district association advertised this as a meeting with the Speaker and used inflammatory, partisan language against the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. It said that Conservatives would propose reckless policy, and would risk our health, safety and pocketbooks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8426884">That is where the prima facie case of privilege was violated, because they used inflammatory language. Again, that undermines the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> in his ability to maintain impartiality. We know also that he, in the issue of freedom of speech, not that long ago, threw out, first, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278459" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation>, who used unparliamentary language but withdrew that comment. It was in the blues. They may want to talk about it but it was in the blues and then it was edited out. We still need to get that ruling on who made that edit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426885">The second thing is that, following that, he then threw out the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, the leader of the Conservative Party, the member of Parliament for Carleton, because of inflammatory language, but did not apply that fairly, because even though the word “wacko” was used to describe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Prime Minister also, before that, had used inflammatory language, calling the leader “spineless”. There was no action, no withdrawal, no apology sought, no ejection from the chamber by the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation>, again undermining and proving that our Speaker is not impartial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426886">On those occasions, we talk about freedom of speech but we also have to talk about the maintenance of being non-partisan, of being impartial. It says, again, in chapter 7, under the roles of the Speaker, on page 324, that “in order to protect the impartiality of the office, the Speaker abstains from all partisan political activity”. This includes not going to caucus meetings, never mind attending Liberal fundraisers. The first time the Speaker got caught, he attended a fundraising dinner for a neighbouring Liberal. That is not allowed. He can attend his own, but he is not allowed to attend other Liberal fundraisers. He then, by video, addressed, in his robes, in full Speaker garb, the Ontario Liberal Party leadership convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426887">I filed a complaint with the procedure and House affairs committee, of misuse of government resources, of House resources, to further partisan activities, of which the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation> was found guilty, and ordered to pay a fine. Again, here we go. He is supposed to be impartial. He was not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426888">We also know that the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation> went down to Washington on the taxpayer dime and gave a speech about being a young Liberal down in D.C.. The Speaker continues to do partisan activities, behaves from a partisan position when occupying the Chair, and undermines the individual rights, freedoms and immunities that all of us are supposed to enjoy. Instead of being the guardian of our rights, he has ejected Conservative members. He has given a pass to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. His overall, and I do not know what the appropriate term here would be, as I do not want to be unparliamentary, ongoing loyalty to the Liberal Party and not to this chamber is what has caused the situation we find ourselves in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426889">Any other members in this House, from the Liberals or their coalition cover-up partners in the NDP, who stand here and say that this Speaker is impartial are sadly mistaken. I am so disappointed in the NDP. It has always stood on the grounds that they protect this institution. It is actually helping to undermine our democratic principles, the respect and honour that this chamber is supposed to hold, by continuing to support the Liberals in their ongoing reckless spending, as well as protect the<Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96"> Speaker</Affiliation>, who is not up to the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426890">The House is seized with a question. The government has moved the motion to limit debate.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426912"> Aside from the excerpt, I wish to elaborate on why a Speaker must be non-partisan, be seen to be non-partisan and avoid partisan activities. That is because the Speaker is, first and foremost, the Speaker of the House of Commons. He or she is the Speaker of the entire House and for all honourable members of the House, entrusted with significant powers and authority to rule not only on matters of procedure but also on matters that go to the heart of the rights and privileges of each hon. member of the august chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426913">The Speaker is like a referee or a judge. The Speaker's rulings are final. There is no appeal. As such, in order for Speakers to fulfill their responsibilities, they must retain the respect and confidence of members. In order to do so, the Speaker must rise above day-to-day partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426914">I will add a few caveats to that. Each Speaker, generally, has arrived in this place after running for a political party. However, when they become the Speaker, they are expected to not engage in partisan activity, notwithstanding the fact that they would have had a partisan background; other than that, they continue to serve as a Liberal or Conservative MP, but not in sit in the Conservative or Liberal caucus or any political party's caucus. There is some limited flexibility for a Speaker, if they are running for re-election at election time, to run under their party's banner.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8426915">However, even in the context of an election, the Speaker, as has been the practice, has generally refrained from making overtly partisan statements or taking partisan positions, and has generally focused, in the context of a campaign, on local issues and the Speaker's representation as an individual member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426916">With that context about why it is necessary for the Speaker to be non-partisan and to acknowledge the limited caveats to that which exist, as has been the practice, the current <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has repeatedly failed to fulfill the standard that is expected of the Speaker to refrain from partisanship and partisan activities. This is not a case of one lapse in judgment, a one-off, but rather is part of a pattern. Indeed, there have been at least six incidents in which the Speaker has engaged in partisan activities or made partisan comments in the eight short months that he has been Speaker, including three times between December 1 and December 5, 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426917">The first incident occurred on December 1, 2023, when the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> voluntarily set up an interview with Laura Stone of the Globe and Mail on the topic of the Ontario Liberal leader, John Fraser's, retiring, in which the Speaker heaped praise on the Ontario Liberal leader, a partisan figure, and referred to the Liberal Party of Ontario as “our party”. At the very least, it demonstrated a total lack of judgment on the part of the Speaker to set up an interview with a national newspaper reporter to engage in what amounted to partisan commentary praising a partisan political figure in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426918">One could say that maybe that was just a one-off, an error in judgment, but it did not end there. The very next day, a video was played of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, at the ultrapartisan venue of the Ontario Liberal Party leadership convention, providing a partisan message to a partisan political figure, namely the same outgoing Ontario Liberal Party leader, John Fraser. The Speaker in his message spoke about his own years of activism in the Liberal Party and how he worked hand in hand with John Fraser to help get Dalton McGuinty elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426919">To make matters worse, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> shot the video from the Speaker's office in the House of Commons, used parliamentary resources to convey a partisan message to be played at a partisan political convention and wore the non-partisan robes of the Speaker, to add insult to injury. As problematic as that was, the message on the video was a message from the Speaker of the House of Commons, played at the Ontario Liberal Convention. When it was reported and when people saw the video, there was general shock that the Speaker had done something that clearly had crossed a line.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8426920">However, the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> did not have the humility even to acknowledge that he had made a mistake. He dismissed his transgression as merely one of perception. When he came before the procedure and House affairs committee, he did not accept any real responsibility, just like his friend the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He said that it was a big misunderstanding and that the video was intended for a smaller private gathering. I do not suppose it makes it much better that the Speaker would use House of Commons resources conveying a partisan message to be played at a smaller partisan venue of Ontario Liberals, but that is the Speaker's logic. I would say it is illogic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426921">The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s explanation, by the way, did not add up. The explanation was outright contradicted by other witnesses who came to committee and said that the request had been made from Mr. Fraser's wife to the Speaker's chief of staff, that the video had always been intended to be played at the Ontario Liberal convention and that there was no private, intimate event that occurred or that was ever planned. However, I digress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426922">As the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> was being called out for his partisan activities of shooting a partisan video played at a partisan convention, requiring the House to be seized of a matter of the first prima facie question of privilege, the Speaker, to demonstrate his contempt, while the House was sitting and while it was seized with the matter, took off to Washington, D.C. at taxpayers' expense to hobnob with a bunch of liberal D.C. elites, where the Speaker yet again engaged in partisanship. This was while he was under fire for two partisan transgressions. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426923"> The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> attended a reception for Claus Gramckow, who was retiring from the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, a foundation closely connected with the Liberal Party of Canada's sister party in Germany. During the reception, the Speaker talked about his days as a Liberal youth president. The Speaker was essentially thumbing his nose at the House and demonstrating that in his mind the rules and the standards that apply to the Speaker of the House do not apply to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426924"> It should be noted that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> did not get off scot-free for his transgression. The procedure and House affairs committee, in a report that was adopted by the House, ordered that the Speaker reimburse the House of Commons for any costs associated with the production of the video using House of Commons resources, as well as provide an apology to the House, which the Speaker initially refused to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426925">One would think that, after that, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> might have learned his lesson, but it seems he did not, because we found out shortly afterwards that the Speaker had been engaging in other partisan activities. For example, the Speaker attended a Quebec Liberal Party political reception for the Quebec Liberal MNA for Gatineau. It was then reported in the National Post that within weeks of being elected as Speaker of the House, the Speaker contacted a former Liberal MP to write an op–ed praising him and attacking the official opposition.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8426926"> The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> took it upon himself to orchestrate an op-ed attacking the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, using a friend to do so because he knew that he could not do so publicly. That is conduct completely unbecoming of a Speaker. It was calculated partisanship by the Speaker, and he hoped that he could do it in a hidden way using his friend, a former Liberal MP. However, he was caught as a result of a report in the National Post. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426927">Now we have the latest transgression by the Speaker, which is that the Speaker's Liberal riding association of <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation> organized an event, “A Summer Evening with the [Speaker]”. On its face, if it was simply an event hosted by his riding association and was simply billed as a summer evening with the hon. member, that would not be an issue. It has been the practice for Speakers to attend events in their riding, including events of their local association, and to do so in a way that is not overly partisan. However, that is not what happened in this case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426928">In fact, what was posted to promote the event was an ultrapartisan message. I think it is important to read that message, which was posted on the Liberal Party website for “A Summer Evening with the [Speaker].” It was an “opportunity to join fellow Liberals and talk about the ways we can continue to build a better future for all Canadians.” On top of that, it says, “While [the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>] and the Conservatives propose reckless policies that would risk our health, safety, and pocketbooks, our Liberal team is focused on making life more affordable for Canadians”. It went on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426929">That is an overtly partisan message, and it is not one, two or three, but six times that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has crossed the line. It really comes down to this: How many times does this have to happen? It has happened six times in eight months. Enough is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426930"> The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has repeatedly fallen below the standard expected of a Speaker, a standard that has been adhered to by his predecessors. I say respectfully that if he truly had an appreciation and respect for the high office that he serves and the authority that it carries over the House, he would do the honourable thing and resign as Speaker of the House. However, seeing as he has not seen fit to do that, it leaves us no other choice, as put forward in this motion, but to vote non-confidence in the Speaker. He has lost the confidence of the official opposition and the Bloc Québécois and has demonstrated a repeated pattern of partisanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426931">I urge the passage of this motion, but I hope that it does not come to that. I hope the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> finally does the right thing and resigns.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8426988">I also want to note that the Speaker exhibited a serious lack of judgment on several occasions, particularly when he recorded a partisan video while dressed in his Speaker robes in the offices he occupies and with the resources of the House that are at his disposal because of the responsibilities assigned to him since his election as Speaker. Furthermore, when he apologized, it was not for having engaged in partisan acts, but for how these acts had been interpreted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8426989"> During his testimony before the committee, in response to one of my questions, Eric Janse, the Speaker's top professional procedural adviser, stated that, as Clerk of the House, he would have advised against recording this video had the Speaker asked for his advice. No such request was made, however. Not only did the Speaker not take to heart the information he had received about his duty of impartiality, but he did not see fit to request advice from the appropriate professionals at his disposal in the exercise of his duties. The fact that the Speaker did not ask his top adviser for advice and that he then neglected to mention to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs that he had participated in other partisan activities demonstrates once again that the Speaker tends to lack judgment.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, with the latest incident, he has once again revealed that he has neither, and that is why we will be supporting the motion we are debating today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427000">Madam Speaker, let us be clear. I am not giving a speech here to slow down or block the pharmacare program. Personally, I would like every individual and every citizen to have access to the medication that they need. That is very important, and we want that to go forward. That being said, we have serious concerns about the way that is being done, and rightly so. For example, Quebec is not being consulted, and the program is not being aligned with the existing program. The work keeps being done in layers of silos. I am not rising today to delay the passage of the bill, quite the contrary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427001">We are debating a fundamental issue: the partiality of the Speaker. Can he be trusted to do his job in the House? Even though I get along really well with him, we see that he is unable to be neutral and use good judgment when deciding on his activities. That is serious. Members can use sophistry and say that another Speaker before him was even worse, but that is not the issue. Today, we are looking at the actions of the current Speaker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427006">Madam Speaker, it brings us no joy to speak on a matter like the one we are seized with today, but we must do it, because the Speaker's role is important. The Speaker's job is to maintain order in the House of Commons. He must ensure members do not cross the floor to hit each other, as we have seen in other parliaments. He must make impartial decisions about the operation of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427007"> Today, we are once again debating the Speaker's impartiality. I would like to provide a little historical background, if I may.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427008"> We inherited Britain's parliamentary monarchy. The first Speaker was either Sir Peter de la Mare, in 1376, or Sir Thomas Hungerford, in 1377. Back then, the Speaker was considered as much the King's man as the servant of the House. It was not until 1642 that the Speaker broke with the Crown, when Speaker William Lenthall stood up to Charles I as the King sat in the Speaker's chair, demanding the heads of five parliamentary leaders. Despite threats, Speaker Lenthall stood up to the King, thereby cleaving his role from the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427009"> After this, the speakership was still an appointment coveted by the parties in power, since it gave them extra leverage to promote their ideas and ideals. Only in 1728, when Arthur Onslow became Speaker, was the role severed from the party in power and shifted toward impartiality with the establishment of the first standards of independence and impartiality, which are still associated with the role today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427010"> By the time Charles Shaw-Lefevre became Speaker in 1839, the principle that the Speaker should abstain from all political activity was already firmly established. Unlike the United Kingdom, Canada was not obliged to waste much time debating the Speaker's role, since it was spelled out in the Constitution of 1867, the British North America Act. Apparently, not everything was covered, since we are now in a grey area that the rules did not account for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427011"> Now, I would like to talk a little about the impartiality that the Speaker should show. The authority and duties of the Speaker of the House of Commons arise largely from the Constitution and the written rules of the House.

              <ParaText id="8427017">My colleague has already mentioned a few examples. We see there is a flaw in the Standing Orders when it comes to situations like the one we are dealing with right now, specifically, when activist and partisan activities have taken place outside the House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427018">True, six days after the activity in which the Speaker took part, the Liberal Party said that the press release was its fault and that the Speaker was in no way involved. I seriously question how this party operates and the kind of planning it does. Certainly the Speaker has a right to thank the party's volunteers. Personally, I would have waited for a time when the House was not in session, such as the Quebec's national holiday, or Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day for francophones, or even July 1. Then impartiality would have been respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427019"> That said, the Liberal Party sent a press release without even asking authorization from the person concerned regarding the wording. They did it without even asking the team in that riding if it was really what they wanted to disclose, if it was cautious or proper. The party sent press releases about its own MPs and, in this case, about an MP who is Speaker of the House of Commons. However, they did not inform and or consult MPs on the contents of that press release. Apparently some parties are more democratic than others, because I have always been informed about the content of press releases. When I did not agree with the content of a press release, it was changed. The same applies for all my colleagues. Perhaps this is something that needs improvement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427020"> It is the fault of the Liberal Party, of the party organization. As I was saying, we can ask questions about the timing of the activity, about any follow-up, about how no one monitored the contents of the publication, about how the party did not consult its own MPs before publishing something and about how the team of the member for Hull—Aylmer failed to follow up to ensure that its own press release could be used instead of the party's highly partisan release. Apparently, the member for Hull—Aylmer's team did prepare a press release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427021"> In closing, the current question pertaining to the House's confidence in the Speaker arose not only as a result of a highly partisan press release from the Liberal Party of Canada, at a time when the Speaker was still sitting, when he could have waited to do another activist activity, but also as a result of the decision that he made and that openly raises the question of partisanship. Had the same event been held when the House was not sitting, it would not have created the problems it is creating now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427022"> An impartial Speaker is essential to the functioning of the House of Commons. The impartiality of this office must be so complete that every time the Speaker opens his or her mouth, no member should be able to recall which party the Speaker comes from. That is what full and total impartiality and neutrality look like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427023"> As things stand now, unfortunately, that is not the case with this Speaker. When he makes a decision, between 44% and 45% of the members of the House wonder whether the decision is truly impartial. No one should ever have to wonder about that, regardless of which side of the House they sit on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427038">Madam Speaker, it is my sad duty to rise in the House with another Conservative blocking motion, as the Conservatives have done for the last couple of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427039"> Ever since Erin O'Toole left as leader of the Conservative Party and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> became the leader of the Conservative Party, the Conservatives have brought chaos into the House of Commons, and constant delays. We saw this with the issue of dental care, which the NDP provoked the government to put into place. So far, 100,000 seniors in the first three weeks of the program were able to access dental services, in many cases for the first time in their lives, and many of them in Conservative ridings. Two million seniors have signed up and tens of thousands are signing up each week. We know that, starting next week, people with disabilities and families with kids under 18 will be able to sign up for dental care. The Conservatives have blocked that systematically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427040">Now we have another procedural move by the Conservatives to try to block passage of pharmacare, which would help six million Canadians suffering from diabetes and nine million Canadians who are looking to control their own reproductive health without huge financial costs. Particularly, women's reproductive freedom is absolutely fundamental. The Conservatives have been blocking that bill since February 29. They know that it is back in the House today and instead of allowing a vote to take place, they have been steadfastly blocking this with consideration of this procedural motion that will be voted on tonight, thanks to a procedural move that was made a few hours ago. Then we will finally be able to move on to issues that are of real concern, like putting in place pharmacare for six million Canadians with diabetes and ensuring that nine million Canadians have access to contraception. This is fundamentally important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427041">There is also the issue of affordable housing that the NDP, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> and the entire NDP caucus, has pushed the government to put into place. Therefore, we will start to see the construction of affordable housing after a dismal two decades, first under the Conservatives, when we saw housing prices and food bank lineups double. Tragically, the Liberals did the same thing, keeping in place many of the Harper-regime policies that have had such a profound detrimental impact on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427042"> I would point out the infamous Harper tax haven treaties that cost Canadians $30 billion each and every year, according to the PBO. It is sad beyond belief that we are unable to pay for so many important things that would make a difference in lives of people and NDP initiatives that are blocked constantly by the Conservatives. At the same time, the Conservatives seem proud of the fact that they continue to give $30 billion a year to overseas tax havens and the very wealthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427043">Those are my concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427044"> We know that this is a procedural delay. It is designed to block pharmacare. However, there is an underpinning that I find extremely disquieting, which is that the Conservatives are trying to run roughshod over our independent institutions, writ large. What happened in the Saskatchewan legislature over the last few months is absolutely despicable. No Conservative has apologized. No Conservative has stepped forward and talked about what happened with a former member of the conservative Saskatchewan Party. The House leader of that party has been intimidating the independent Speaker of the Saskatchewan legislature. Not a single Conservative has stepped up and said “That is unacceptable.” Saskatchewan MPs sat with that member, Jeremy Harrison, who has been both physically and mentally intimidating the independent Speaker of the Saskatchewan legislature and not a single Conservative has stood to say that it is wrong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427055"> Madam Speaker, that is exactly the point. The Conservatives threaten; they cut people off. As for the decorum in the Saskatchewan legislature, I need to read into the record what Conservatives in Saskatchewan have done to the independent Speaker, because it is very germane to the kinds of ongoing attacks against the speakership of the House of Commons. We elect a Speaker. We ensure that the Speaker continues on good behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427056"> What we have seen is the Conservatives attacking in a way that we have never seen before. I have raised constantly points of order about the social media posts that have been the most disgusting, disrespectful material possible, attacking the speakership of the House of Commons. It is unbelievable. It is something that Conservatives in the past ruled very clearly on, saying that in no circumstances was it appropriate to attack the Speaker or the speakership, yet Conservatives now do this routinely, as if destroying the speakership is some kind of childish game to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427057">What happened just a few days ago in Saskatchewan is indicative of that lack of respect for our institutions that we see routinely now from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> and the entire Conservative caucus. No members speak up. Only the member for <Affiliation DbId="278236" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> had the courage to stand and say that what was happening in the Conservative Party was unacceptable. He now sits as an independent. Thankfully, at least one Conservative was willing to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427058"> I know that other members of the Conservative caucus have strong misgivings about what Conservatives are doing now in the House and the attacks that they are levying against all our institutions, whether it is the Bank of Canada, or the Parliamentary Budget Officer, or the Auditor General or the speakership of the House of Commons. There are Conservatives that have profound misgivings but they are not voicing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427059">I would ask the Conservative caucus to reflect on what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has done and the kinds of attacks the Conservative Party and Conservative members are levying against our parliamentary institutions, our democratic institutions, our independent institutions, and speak out. It is fine to convey misgivings privately. It takes courage to speak up publicly. I would encourage them to speak publicly. What happened in Saskatchewan is happening here. We will be able to get through, with a vote this evening, this procedural game the Conservatives are playing to block pharmacare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427060">What happened in Saskatchewan is even more distasteful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427061"> I will read now into the record the comments by the independent Speaker of the Saskatchewan legislature, directing his comments toward the attacks of the conservative Saskatchewan Party, including from ex-members of the Conservative caucus. He talks about the obsession in Saskatchewan of the government House leader, former member Jeremy Harrison, former member of the Conservative caucus, saying that what is “more disturbing is his obsession with guns and his use of intimidation both verbally and physically. His desire to get permission to carry a handgun in the legislative assembly is particularly disturbing.”</ParaText>

He said, “My concerns over his mental stability and his obsession with guns was only confirmed when he heckled after the passing of the motion to devolve all relevant parts of the Firearms Act to the province. He twice yelled, open carry, open carry next.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427071">The attacks against the Speaker of the Saskatchewan legislature by the conservative Saskatchewan Party are very similar to the attacks we are seeing now against the speakership of the House of Commons. This is not something that is innocuous or innocent. It is something that needs to be taken under consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427072"> I have repeatedly risen in the House, talking about the incessant attacks that we are seeing on social media from the Conservative Party against the speakership of the House of Commons. I will give credit where credit is due. The members of the Bloc Québécois, despite the fact that they continue to raise procedural blockages to the House of Commons, have not attacked the speakership of the House of Commons openly on social media. Why? Because it contravenes the rules of our House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427073">The rules of our House were set by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, the now House leader for the Conservative Party. He said, “Reflections on the character or actions of the Speaker—an allegation of bias, for example—could be taken by the House as breeches of privilege and punished accordingly.” The Speaker also said at that time, in this ruling that dates back to 2014, “I urge all members to be judicious in the expressions they choose to use.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427074">That was the Conservatives when they were in power, saying that there was no transgression against attacking the speakership of the House of Commons. Now we see them in opposition not doing anything that actually helps anybody. They are blocking dental care, pharmacare, affordable housing and the consumer protection provisions that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> has brought forward, which would start helping Canadians against food price and gas price gouging, which has happened with corporate CEOs determining the prices and the gouging they do with impunity. Those provisions are something the NDP has been pushing for years, and finally they are coming into being. However, all of those pieces of legislation have been blocked by the incessant attacks by the Conservative caucus against the speakership of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427075">The Conservatives would have loved to have spent the next three weeks debating this, rather than getting pharmacare in place, which would help six million Canadians who have diabetes, and I will come back to that in a moment, and nine million Canadian women, who want their full reproductive rights and freedoms, to have access to contraception.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427076"> For diabetes, the Conservatives' constant blocking since February 29 of the pharmacare act that the NDP initiated, pushing in this minority Parliament to get it done, hurts people like my constituent Amber, who is paying $1,000 a month for diabetes medication. She is paying that out of pocket. She is struggling because of the lack of affordable housing, because of the Harper government's refusal to build affordable housing and the current government's reluctance, until the NDP forced it to finally budget that. All of the other provisions that would help Canadians, the Conservatives have blocked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427077">We are seeing, systematically, an attack not only on the speakership of the House of Commons, but also on all our institutions. People would say, and they would be right, that the NDP MPs are the worker bees of Parliament. We get things done for people, even people in Conservative ridings. In fact, Conservative ridings have benefited from the NDP's work perhaps more than any other, because of the success of the dental care program within even the first three weeks. More Conservative ridings are benefiting from dental care, because the seniors who have signed up are finally accessing, sometimes for the first time in their lives, it. Therefore, we are the worker bees, but we are also the adults in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427078">We saw this last fall when the <Affiliation DbId="278667" Type="2">former Speaker</Affiliation> made a choice that, to our minds, simply compelled that Speaker to step down. Members will recall that no other party was calling for the Speaker's resignation. We put it forward with dignity. We did not criticize or attack the Speaker. In fact, we thought the former Speaker had done a decent job. However, given its magnitude, we believed that what unfolded last fall necessitated the Speaker's resignation. We clearly communicated that; eventually, other parties agreed with us, and the Speaker did resign. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427079">We went through a process that took a couple of weeks, and we elected a new <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>. However, the new Speaker initially made a number of errors that forced the House to consider the matter and refer it to PROC, which then referred it back to the House, and we voted on that. There were a number of sanctions and some solutions that were put into place. However, since then, we have not seen the kind of behaviour that would necessitate any kind of motion such as this, quite the contrary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427080">The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has stood up and maintained decorum, but Conservatives have not liked that. The fact is, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> was called to order when he used an atrociously unparliamentary, disrespectful term, attacking another member of the House. He was asked to withdraw it and refused; he was then asked to withdraw for the day. That happens, and we have seen it happen with other members of Parliament. When we use unparliamentary terms, we have to ensure that we are willing to undergo the consequences that come from that. It is a question of basic personal responsibility. I know that is alien to members of at least one party in the House, but when one makes such an error, one has to be willing to accept the consequences of one's actions. However, the member for Carleton did not accept the consequences. He renewed his attacks on the Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427081">Now, we have a situation where the Liberal Party of Canada was clearly at fault and clearly disrespected the speakership by posting something without the knowledge or the authorization of the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>. However, the Conservatives did not attack the Liberal Party of Canada, which is what they should have done. They love to attack, so why did they not attack the author of the error? It was only the NDP that called on the Liberal Party of Canada to fully apologize to the speakership, which is ultimately, thankfully, what members of the Liberal Party did. They should have apologized right away, but they did not. However, pressure from the NDP meant that the Liberal Party of Canada apologized, which should have closed it and ended this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427082"> We should not be spending days talking through this procedural delay when, at the same time, we have pharmacare pending. The sooner pharmacare is approved, the sooner the benefits can go to people such as my constituent, Amber, who is paying $1,000 every month. Conservatives do not seem to care about that, but for her, those costs are enormous, and six million Canadians like her struggle every single month. Therefore, to delay pharmacare by putting forward procedural motions that delay the adoption of the bill means that it takes that much longer to help Amber and people like her. In this case, we are seeing a deliberate attempt by Conservatives not to look at the speakership in an impartial way, in an adult way, and if an error happens, to ensure that there is the appropriate consequence. That is what happened last fall and last December. No, they now want to invent, push and expose anything they feel they can, attack the independent speakership of the House of Commons and, in a very real way, diminish our parliamentary institutions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427123">This is a Speaker's scandal. For thousands of good people, today is another sad day, a day where our democracy is being disrespected and Canadians' confidence in the House of Commons is being put to the test. The Liberals have too often demonstrated a lack of ethics since 2015, especially when it comes to high-level positions such as <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada or Speaker of the House of Commons, in the case we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427124"> As members know, the Speaker is supposed to be impartial, non-partisan and beyond reproach. However, the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation> is struggling to figure out the difference between the role of member and the role of Speaker, or at least, he still does not understand, despite his previous mistakes, that it is not appropriate for a Speaker to engage in Liberal partisan activity. He should have seen the position as a great opportunity in his political career, but he immediately took it for granted. It is different this time, though, because he was found guilty of not being up to the task.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427125"> This is the third time in the span of a few months that the Speaker has neglected his responsibility to remain non-partisan. Let me give a quick recap of the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427126"> In recent months, the Speaker has spoken at a fundraising cocktail party for a Liberal neighbour. He has addressed an Ontario Liberal Party convention dressed in his Speaker robes, and he has flown to Washington on Canadian taxpayers' dime to deliver a speech about the good old days when he was a member of the Young Liberals of Canada. I do not know whether this is because he had never dreamed of holding such a post, but his actions are unworthy of the office of Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427127"> As members will recall, the previous Speaker of the House had to resign. We cannot question the reason for his departure, but we can salute him for having the courage to leave his post with humility. He recognized his mistakes and acted accordingly, understanding that the serious nature of our democratic institutions is worth preserving. The office must always trump personal partisan ambitions. In contrast, the current Speaker has demonstrated time and again not only his inability to remain neutral, but also his disdain for the neutrality of his post through his stubborn determination to hold onto it. His apologies are not enough. In some respects, they seem like a last-ditch attempt to salvage his chances of staying on as Speaker of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427128"> Now might be a good time to take a walk down memory lane to remind ourselves of the events in question. First, the Speaker participated in a cocktail reception for party activists, for which he was fined just $1,500, despite the unacceptable nature of the error. Although using his office and Speaker's robes in an undeniably partisan setting ought to have led to an automatic dismissal, the Liberals saw fit to buy peace. Next, he overstepped his authority as Speaker by ejecting the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation> and leader of the official opposition, in an illegitimate and undeniably partisan manner, for using language that has now been accepted by all following further review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427129"> Now we have learned that the Speaker of the House is set to take part in a clearly partisan event, which was advertised with incendiary anti-Conservative materials. I understand that the Speaker is still attached to his role as the member for Hull—Aylmer. I myself am very committed to constituency work, which must be done for the benefit of all citizens, even those who did not vote for us. I agree that some aspects of this work are also partisan in nature. However, the role of Speaker is so important for unity in the House and in the country that we cannot allow it to be subject to these divisive dynamics, which, in this case, played out to an unhealthy degree. The fact that the position of Speaker of the House was exploited for partisan purposes leaves a bad taste that cannot be compared or contrasted with the work of any other member.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427130"> The many events, particularly this last one, are pure provocation. They demonstrate an arrogance that undermines Canadians' confidence in our institutions and promotes cynicism toward politics in general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427131"> As elected officials, our number one priority is to serve and represent our constituents. This job comes with a certain number of privileges, but it also comes with responsibilities. There are rules that hold us accountable to Canadians, as well as to the House that represents them. That responsibility is what we must always be thinking about for Canada's future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427132"> The real reasons keeping the Speaker from resigning remain unclear. It may come down to ego, visceral partisanship or political pressure from his caucus or party. However, regardless of the reasons, I am once again asking the Speaker to resign in the interest of everyone, to ensure that the extremely important work that is done here can carry on properly. It is a matter of common sense, and I salute my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois, who, for once, have reached the same conclusion we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427133"> The current Speaker has shown that he does not intend to remain impartial. We have known for months that the Speaker does not intend to do his job properly or fairly. We are therefore asking the NDP to grow a spine and stand up for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427134"> We will have to make a decision because, clearly, the Speaker of the House does not have the humility needed to step down, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not appear to think there is a problem. It is our duty to ensure that the House operates in an impartial and non-partisan manner. I am counting on my colleagues to put an end to this Speaker's scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427152">Over the weekend, I had a great opportunity to spend some time at the ball diamonds. Baseball season is in full swing in Saskatchewan. A lot of people at the ball diamonds who came up to me have been paying attention to what is happening in the news, what is happening here in Ottawa. They will ask, “What is going on with the Speaker in the House of Commons?” They are seeing what is happening now. The reason why they are paying so much attention to this is that it is not the first time and not the second time but the third time the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has engaged in partisan behaviour. Using a baseball analogy, when a player get three strikes, they are out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427153"> Even the <Affiliation DbId="278812" Type="7">House leader for the NDP</Affiliation>, after a previous violation by the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>, said that if this were to happen again, that would be it. If he were to renege on that now, it would basically be like the umpire's saying that a player had three strikes but that they would give the player another pitch and just see what happens. What is going to happen if there is another strike? Is it going to be the same thing, or will the NDP let the Speaker try again?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427154">At what point will the NDP grow a spine and stick true to its words? It is absolutely shameful for the NDP to renege on what happened. The <Affiliation DbId="278812" Type="7">NDP House leader</Affiliation> stood in front of the media and said that if it were to happen again, something would have to be done, yet here we are. The NDP is already saying it is going to vote with the government on closure on the bill. We are going to have a vote on this later tonight. It is absolutely shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427155">I was first elected in 2019. One of the first speeches I gave in the chamber was actually on the “Peschisolido Report 2020”. A former Liberal member of Parliament from Steveston—Richmond East was found guilty of breaking ethics rules. Actually, the then ethics commissioner, Mr. Dion, said at the time, “Given Mr. Peschisolido's chronic failure to comply with the code's disclosure requirements, there is no doubt in my mind I would have recommended that Parliament impose appropriate sanctions”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427156">In 2023, the current <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House</Affiliation>'s title was the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister. If colleagues will allow me to go back to my baseball analogy, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister of Canada</Affiliation> himself has three reports in his own name. On the Commissioner of Ethics' website, there are three reports that bear the name of the Prime Minister of this country. Strike one, strike two, strike three, and yet here we are. The Prime Minister actually has been given another strike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427157">We have had a few other issues with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> since the last report was written, so he has been given lots of pitches, lots of chances, here, and somehow he is still standing at the plate. Right now the NDP is propping up the Prime Minister and the Liberals, enabling them and allowing this to happen. When I talk to people at the ball diamonds, they ask, “How on earth do these guys get three strikes and they are not out? How does that happen?” Where is the respect for the institutions of this place?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427158"> As members of Parliament, when a member is part of the government, they are a part of the Crown. There is an “honourable” designation beside the member's name. This place is based and founded on the honour system. When a member has multiple infractions, such as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the current <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> have, one would think they would have done the honourable thing by now: accepted responsibility and resigned.

It suggested a variety of policy changes that would lead to such things as defibrillators in newly constructed homes and buildings, training in the use of CPR and defibrillation as a part of drivers' licence testing, revising regulatory frameworks to streamline the introduction of new defibrillator technologies into the market and putting defibrillators into all police vehicles in the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427473">Mr. Speaker, before question period, I was just getting into the relationship between the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is worth noting that in 2023, the Speaker was the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister. As I was saying, the Prime Minister himself has three ethics reports written in his own name. I was alluding to, and I asked a question of one of the Bloc members earlier concerning it, the fact that it sure seems like there is a contest or a competition between the Prime Minister and the Speaker to see how many ethics violations or breaches of trust they can have and get away with it. The NDP continues to prop them up, despite these things piling up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427474"> Let us take a look. Since 2015, there have been no fewer than 10 Liberal ministers and parliamentary secretaries who have been found guilty of violating and breaking ethics laws of this institution. On top of that, there was a PMO staffer. There are also multiple members of the existing cabinet who are still sitting who have ethics violations. One of them happens to be the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs</Affiliation>. One happens to be the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">international trade minister</Affiliation>, and one happens to be the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">minister of sport</Affiliation>. Therefore, there seems to be a chronic problem within cabinet, which is what the Ethics Commissioner said of Joe Peschisolido, former Liberal member for Steveston—Richmond East, that there was a chronic issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427475"> In 2023, when the Ethics Commissioner specifically wrote about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, CBC published an interesting article. In it, the Ethics Commissioner said: “After years of serving in senior government positions, [the member] should have been aware of the rules or should have sought advice. I am quite concerned that someone with the breadth of experience of [the member] would fail to recognize the possibility of a contravention”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427476">The Ethics Commissioner also said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427479">What did the member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, now the Speaker of the House, have to say at the time? He said, “I will redouble my efforts to be more diligent in the future to ensure my obligations under the act are fully met.” He has really doubled down, has he not? In fact he has tripled down, with three more violations. They are not so much ethics violations per se, but they are serious lapses in ethics by the Speaker. There is the video, a partisan video for a Liberal fundraiser, which we have talked about in the House already, in which he was wearing his Speaker's gowns in the Speaker's office, giving a speech and a video remark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427480"> Then he went to Washington, not just as the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, but as the Speaker of the House, to talk to young Liberals in Washington. That is another one, number two. What should be strike number three and out is the new one that we are debating again here today, where the Liberal Party of Canada had on its website an invitation to have a fine evening with the Speaker of the House of Commons, and it used his name, which I cannot do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427481">If the Conservative Party of Canada is going to use my name on a fundraiser, it is going to ask me about it. It is going to coordinate with me about it. It is going to check with my schedule to see whether it works for me to be able to come and do the event. Of course I will have to say, “Yes, I can,” or “No, I cannot.” The fact that it got this far tells us that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> said “Yes, absolutely, let us do it.” That alone should have been the first thing that came to his mind.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427492">We have seen, just recently, the same thing happening with the conservative Saskatchewan Party. The independent Speaker of the Saskatchewan Legislature has said that he was both verbally and physically intimated by the conservative Saskatchewan Party House leader, who is a former member of the Conservative caucus, Jeremy Harrison. The Speaker of the legislature said, “[The desire of this man] to get permission to carry a handgun in the legislative assembly is particularly disturbing,” and “My concerns over his mental stability and his obsession with guns [have been] confirmed”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427493">This is from the independent Speaker of the Saskatchewan Legislature.

              <ParaText id="8427498">To begin, I would like to convey to the House my respect for my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, who is an affable, warm and cordial person and who also happens to be the Speaker of the House right now. I wanted to make the distinction because it is not the individual, the MP himself, who is being called into question, but rather the embodiment of his role as Speaker. Beyond that, as many have said yesterday and today, it is the very functioning of the House of Commons that is being called into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427499">I am taking the time to reiterate this distinction, which makes perfect sense but seems to be misunderstood by government members. I listened to the debates yesterday and I am listening carefully today. It has to be said that if someone does not understand this distinction, it is difficult for them to take part in this debate, because it is the very basis on which it rests. In the same vein, since we have to make this distinction between the role of Speaker and that of member of Parliament, I would say that we must also manage, as members of the House of Commons, to distinguish between the roles we take on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427500">I would invite the members of the governing Liberal Party to reflect on the fact that they are not here to protect one of their own, but to protect democracy and the institution that is the House of Commons. I think we need to be mindful of the motion we are considering today, because it arises from a question of privilege. This implies that the Speaker ruled in favour of the member who raised this question of privilege. I would like to quote from the Speaker's ruling on the question of privilege because I think it is useful.</ParaText>

This debate is much needed. We are asking for a solution and for the issue to be addressed in a timely manner. When such a motion of privilege is moved, it has to take priority. I am repeating myself, but giving priority to this motion underscores the importance of the debate currently taking place in the House.</ParaText>

It is worthwhile to note that the root of the word “impartiality” is “party”, so there is that notion of neutrality.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427506"> Once again, this is not a question of political stripe. We are talking about the very role of Speaker, which should be above all partisan considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427507"> I would like to take a moment to remind the House of the highlights of the story that led to this debate that has been going on since December 2023, since the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> of the House participated in an event organized by the Liberal Party of Ontario. The Speaker demonstrated then that he was unable to act with the neutrality I spoke of or show good judgment. I will identify four elements. He gave a speech in the Speaker of the House's robes, gave his title as Speaker of the House, and produced a video in the Speaker of the House's office and, by extension, using the House's resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427508"> I am limiting myself to this portion of the story, although there are many more, since I believe that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, either on this one occasion or on many others, patently demonstrated by his actions that he did not understand the obligations associated with the position of Speaker of the House. Worse yet, once he was criticized for his actions, he failed to admit that they were unacceptable. He regretted none of his actions, although they were cut and dried and, as was stated in committee, could not be interpreted any other way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427509"> However, he did regret the video that was publicly broadcast. It is the fact that it was publicly broadcast that he regretted. He does not acknowledge his mistake, but regrets how it was interpreted. It remains a mistake, regardless of how it was subsequently interpreted. Moreover, he does not acknowledge any partisanship in his actions. He also fails to mention other, similar partisan actions he took while he was speaker. His refusal to admit his mistake supports the idea I shared earlier, that the Speaker does not understand the obligations associated with his position. Worse still, it shows his inability, whether voluntary or involuntary, to make amends. There is no change possible because he does not understand, and he refuses to apologize, understand or change his behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427510">This incident, isolated from the ones that would follow, such as the speech in Washington, already attests to a lack of impartiality and judgment. We are now in May, but as early as last December, the Speaker demonstrated his inability to perform his duties. As we know, the legitimacy of his role is built on trust. That trust has eroded over the past few months and, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278766" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> was saying yesterday, the lack of trust turns into mistrust, and mistrust turns into defiance. Over half of the House is calling on the Speaker to step down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427511">When the Speaker fails to perform his duties and refuses to learn from it, when he loses the trust of the House and refuses to earn it back, when he knowingly harms the work of this institution, the House of Commons, in other words, Quebeckers and Canadians, we reach a point where the Speaker could regain the esteem and respect of the entire House by doing the only honourable thing that a Speaker who is not discharging his duties can do, and that is to leave. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427512">Madam Speaker, before we move on to questions and comments, I would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to move the following motion: That, given that the House is currently debating a non-confidence motion in the Speaker of the House on which the House will have to vote, that the Speaker is usually elected through a secret ballot, and that the secret ballot prevents any attempt to influence the vote and ensures that the result represents the real will of the members of our assembly, the House defer the vote planned for today until Monday, June 3, 2024, at 3 p.m. and that the vote be conducted by secret ballot in the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8427534">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by saying that trust is a really difficult thing to earn, a really easy thing to lose and an incredibly difficult thing to re-establish. What we have heard in the House today, time and time again, from members of the Liberal Party and from those who support them at every opportunity, the NDP members, is that for some reason, this is a waste of time. We have heard that this is a waste of House time or that this is an attack on the institution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427535">In fact, it is exactly the opposite of that. It is a question of a <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> that has brought us here, who has acted in a partisan way, not just once or twice, but three times. We are here to discuss the partisan actions of a partisan Liberal Speaker serving his partisan Liberal boss, aided and abetted by his partisan coalition members in the NDP, occupying a job and a role in this place that is distinctly supposed to be non-partisan. Since becoming <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> six months ago, he has betrayed the trust not only of the House but also of the members of the House. The impartiality of the position does not exist in his world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427536">I have not been here very long, but I do not remember, and I do not even remember reading in history about, a Speaker who has been so embroiled in scandal after scandal and who has been chased down the street outside of this place to answer questions about his conduct. It has only been six months. If one types in “Speaker scandal”, I think the name of that chair occupant would come up as the first search term on Google. That is where we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427537">Let us go back. First, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> recorded a video. This is the first of the three that I will talk about, and I will probably talk about some more because it is not even three; it is more than that. First, he recorded a video that he played at a Liberal partisan convention, while appearing in Speaker's robes in his office and while using Speaker and House resources to do that. He praised an outgoing Ontario Liberal leader between segments of two former leaders at a Liberal convention. I think anybody would believe that was a partisan activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427538">Then, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> travelled to Washington on the taxpayers' dime, on the dime of the resources of his office, of the House, and he used his perch as Speaker to muse fondly about his years as a young Liberal. This is also, objectively, a partisan thing to do in a non-partisan job that is meant to be the referee of this place and to have the trust of the members to know he will act in a manner that will treat every single member of the House equally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427539">Those are two instances. Talk about tone deaf. Finally, it is the latest offence, the one that has brought us here today, of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> posting a blatantly partisan fundraising message on a website, personally attacking the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, the same Leader of the Opposition who, just weeks ago, he threw out of this place for doing the exact same thing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did moments before and moments after. This is, of course, after he threw out another member of the Conservative caucus for asking her to withdraw a statement, which she did. It is in the blues. We are probably going to have another day when we talk about the Speaker's frank inability to be impartial in his chair. We will get to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427540">In that same week, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> posted an ad, and it is strange to me. I have not been an MP for very long, and I keep a fairly busy schedule. The way it works in my office is that I have a great staff, and they send me a note and ask me, “Can you do at this time? Can you be here?” I say yes or no to all of these things. In some cases, my office says yes or no to these things, knowing full well that I would want to do something and that it would fit into my schedule. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427541"> Therefore, it is very difficult to believe that an ad for “A Summer Evening with the Honourable [Speaker]” mentioned, who occupies the chair, with event details, such as a time, a date and a place, would not be vetted by anyone. That does not really happen. In fact, when someone appears at events, particularly at events where they sell tickets to listen to a person, in this case, delivering really partisan messages about the guy whom he just kicked out of the House for doing the same thing as the guy who put him in that chair, it would be hard to believe that nobody in his office, nobody in his orbit or he himself would not have known that he would be appearing at a certain place, at a certain time, at this event where tickets are being sold to hear him speak. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427542">All of that is to say that one time is a mistake and two times could be a coincidence, but three times is a pattern. It is a pattern by somebody who has a deep history in the most partisan politics. We will hear from the Liberals that this is somehow an attack on the character of <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">the Speaker</Affiliation>, but this is exactly the opposite of that. This is talking about the role he has taken on as an impartial referee of this place, one that should treat members, as I said, equally. This is, of course, after a history of being the first Speaker with an ethics violation, so that is a historic first. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427543">I was not here at the time, but it does not take very much to go online to see how he reacted to an incident that happened in this place, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> elbowed an MP in the chest. He was the first one on his feet to defend that action and to say that the MP's story or version of events was experienced differently or was an overreaction. In fact, when he was asked that today, at the very time this was being talked about in the House by my colleague and friend from <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, he actually denied rising to his feet, defending the Prime Minister and putting forward an alternative version of events, talking about an exaggeration. He said at committee today that he did not say that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427544">That brings me to the NDP. To see a party, which once stood for values and for the working class and which once was in opposition in the House, defend the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at every opportunity, rather than somebody in its own caucus, is the definition of “weakness”. It is one of its own members who was elbowed by the Prime Minister. There are videos of it. This is not something that Conservatives are embellishing in the House. We can see it on a screen. New Democrats are defending the guy who got up on his feet to tell people that there was a different version of events or that the member was exaggerating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427545">What is worse is that it is the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> who adjudicates the harassment policy in the House. How on earth would any member of the House feel comfortable or feel that they could get a fair trial with somebody who was on his feet, defending the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before even seeing the tape, telling the member that she experienced it differently, that it was an exaggeration or that she somehow dove as if it was for the World Cup. I do not know what terminology was used; it was blatantly weird. It was bizarre. Someone called it wacko.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427546">This is what we are here to talk about today. We are talking about a man who occupies an office and who should be impartial. He has not done so. If he had even a modicum of integrity in this place, he would resign before I encourage members to vote him out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427553">Madam Speaker, first off, of course, we already went through the procedure and House affairs committee, and the House took a vote. Since then, there has not been anything that justifies what the Conservatives are doing today and are doing this week. The Liberal Party of Canada made, in my judgment, a despicable mistake by posting something on its website that showed disrespect to the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> and disrespect to the House of Commons. The Liberals should have apologized immediately. It took them a few hours, but they finally did apologize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427554">What we are seeing, though, is an attack against the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> in the same way that the Conservative Saskatchewan Party is attacking the independent Speaker of the Saskatchewan legislature as well. We have seen verbal intimidation. We have seen threats, and we have seen the use of a firearm. Not a single Conservative has condemned that. I would ask my colleague to condemn what has happened to the Speaker in the Saskatchewan legislature. Will she do it?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427555">Madam Speaker, I can understand why it is very difficult to keep track of all the scandals of the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>. I can completely understand that because every time I see him in the news, it is a different scandal. However, the one we are talking about today is the partisan posting of a fundraising event that the Speaker is part of and that he probably, might have, most likely approved, in terms of time. It is that member over there, who is screaming over me, who has become obsessed with the Saskatchewan legislature. I would say to that member to go and run in Saskatchewan if people are not going to elect him in his seat in B.C.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8427556">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>. I am quite looking forward to her intervention on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427557"> It is actually quite incredible to me that we are in this place at this point. I have been listening to the debate today. I have been listening to the government side. I have been listening to what I now call the moderate wing of the Liberal government, which is the NDP, argue that this is somehow a character assassination. In fact, a member of the opposition, who functions in his role as an opposition member, legitimately fulfilled his constitutional obligation by rising in this place and presenting a question of privilege. This was in relation to an advertisement of a partisan event that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> was going to be participating in. The ad was itself a character assassination of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427558">When a member brings a question of privilege to the House, it means they feel that their privileges, or the privileges of other members, have been violated. At that point, given all the interventions that occur, the Speaker makes a ruling. In this case, the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> was not able to make a ruling, because he was directly implicated in this question of privilege; therefore the <Affiliation DbId="279177" Type="22">Deputy Speaker</Affiliation> made a ruling. In it, he said there may have been a violation of members' privileges. That is it. The independence of the speakership was actually effective at that point in determining that a proper question of privilege had, in fact, happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427559">As is the right of all members, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278358" Type="2">Grande Prairie—Mackenzie</Affiliation> moved a motion based on the <Affiliation DbId="279177" Type="22">Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling, which is what we are now debating. It is not as though any opposition party, be it the Conservative Party, the Bloc Québécois or any other party, wrote this ruling. This was a ruling of the independent Deputy Speaker after the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> recused himself. That is what we are dealing with today. We are not dealing with a character assassination; to be frank, we are dealing with a question of character. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427560">That question of character relates to the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ability to act in an independent, non-partisan manner, to act as a referee with respect for all members and their privileges. That is, in fact, what we are dealing with today. In the short period since the Speaker was appointed as such by the House, we have not just dealt with this on one occasion; there have been two other occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427561">I know that colleagues on our side have been talking about those instances. Of course, the most famous one happened in Ontario. It was shortly after the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> was appointed that he felt compelled, in his Speaker's robe and using the resources of the Speaker's position, to make a video for the Ontario Liberal Party convention. I recall when I first saw that video. It was a Saturday night. I was sitting there, as a former House leader, looking at this video and thinking, What in God's name is he doing? It was partisan. I recall sending a text to our current House leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, and I asked him if he had seen it. How could the Speaker have such bad judgment, poor judgment, that he would make such a video for the Ontario Liberal convention? Of course, that was the first time that the question of privilege came up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427562">Then there was another incident, in Washington, D.C., where the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> travelled on Speaker business and ended up at a partisan event that was videotaped and broadcast on social media. There, he talked about his experiences as a Liberal Party member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427563">Now, of course, there is the latest incident, talking about the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> appearing at a fundraiser. However, within the notice for the fundraiser, there was a partisan attack on the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427564"> It calls into question not only the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ability to be non-partisan but also, in many ways, his judgment. That is the fundamental issue we are dealing with today. It did not just happen once or twice. It has happened three times at this point. I think the ability of the opposition to function in its constitutional obligation and not have confidence in the Speaker is the root of what this question is all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427565">When the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> was elected, he promised this chamber and its members that he would act in a non-partisan way, that he would not get in the way of debate and that he would be the referee, which is his role. However, time and time again, we have seen otherwise. This was not only the case in these three incidents but also in rulings and judgments, not the least of which was removing the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> from the House during question period. That is something that I have not seen in the nine years I have been here. Many members whom I have spoken to, some with a long history in this place, and some with knowledge of history, had not seen anything like that occur before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427566">I can say that I was here the day when that happened. I was watching the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>. We had started off on a Monday. It had been a pretty raucous question period. I know that the Speaker had, at his left hand, the notice of removal. Somebody was going to leave the chamber that day. I am convinced of that, and it happened. We actually had two members that left. One was the member for <Affiliation DbId="278459" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation>, and then that was quickly followed up by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. The challenge right now is trust in the ability of the Speaker to conduct himself in this non-partisan way and with impartiality. That really is what this is all about. Again, this prima facie case of privilege that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278358" Type="2">Grande Prairie—Mackenzie</Affiliation> brought up is what we are dealing with today. It was not written or initiated by the opposition; it is something that was initiated by the Speaker of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427567"> I can say that I do a lot of events; we all do. There is a vetting process that goes on for any event that I attend by my staff to make sure that I am not using House of Commons resources and that those events that I am attending are, in fact, proper events. There is no convincing me that someone in the Speaker's office or the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> himself did not know what was on that invitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427568">Finally, I would like to finish off with what I perceive as a decline in our democracy. I see an erosion of respect for our institutions. The fact is that the Liberals and the NDP are standing up in this place and seemingly defending the actions of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, and they have been doing it since this debate started yesterday. This speaks to a lack of respect for this institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427569">If anyone had any honour or integrity at all, they could see the chaos this is creating. The fact is that their decisions and their lack of judgment, impartiality and non-partisanship is causing such disruption in this place. This speaks to a decline in our democracy and a lack of respect for our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427570">The first time the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> conducted himself in this way, when he made that video for the Ontario Liberal leadership convention, I said that he should have to resign. I believe that was the appropriate time for him to resign. Now we have two other instances where the Speaker has shown this lack of judgment and lack of impartiality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427571">As far as I am concerned, there is no other option. Almost half of the House believes that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has acted in a way that is unbecoming in terms of his role as Speaker and that he does, in fact, need to resign.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427572">I appreciate what the Bloc tried to do before, which was to bring a unanimous consent motion to have a secret ballot when this vote occurs. I believe there are still people within the Liberal Party, and perhaps some within the NDP, who conduct themselves with honour. They see the actions of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> and how that is causing a lack of respect for this place. If a secret ballot were held, I believe that some of those members, other than the ones who are going to stand up as they ask their questions, would actually want to see the Speaker removed, as the motion states.</ParaText>

We have a third party that has said it was fully responsible and has actually apologized for it; then we have the deputy leader of the Conservative Party saying the Speaker most likely approved of it.

Our tradition in here of solving our problems through discourse is what makes Canada Canada. What makes this place this place is the Speaker's role. It is the Speaker's charge under our Standing Orders and under our traditions to maintain impartiality. That has not happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427590">I want to try to implore some of my colleagues from other political parties to think about why the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> needs to go, in concrete terms, with regard to each of the Speaker's three roles. However, before I do that, I want to briefly comment on the <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">deputy leader of the opposition</Affiliation>'s point that was made about trust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427591">The current occupant of the Speaker's chair had a big trust deficit to overcome with the House, because, historically, Parliament has never had someone who had a government appointment take on the role of Speaker in that same Parliament. Not only did he have a minor government appointment; he had the most partisan appointment of all: parliamentary secretary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is like the Prime Minister's defence guy on any topic. So, there was a trust deficit to overcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427592">What happened, now that we are on the third incident, the third case of privilege where the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has demonstrated partisan behaviour, is that it is very clear that impartiality has been breached. Now it is not just about this place; it is about Canadians' faith in this place being able to fairly and neutrally function as a place where their voices can be heard, because if the Speaker is being partisan for the Liberal Party, then the 120,000 people I represent do not have fair hearing in this House automatically. We can respect each other as partisan for our ability to be partisan, but I implore the Speaker to resign on his own accord, because his legacy is now having breached that impartiality, to the point where any decision he makes, any ruling he makes, is going to be viewed through that lens, and that degrades Canadian democracy. So, when we are talking about wasting House time, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> should have resigned already. That is the right thing to do. That is what he should have done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427593"> Now, how does this impact his three roles? First of all, “the Speaker presides over debate in the House and is responsible for enforcing and interpreting all rules...of the House.” Already, the Speaker, outside of the three instances, has had to recuse himself on questions regarding the government withholding information in Order Paper questions or misleading the House. Why? It is because they were Order Paper questions he signed off on in his role as parliamentary secretary, which is problematic in and of itself. Then, with this partisanship, not just allegations, but a clear case of privilege being found, which is why we are debating this right now, when he makes the decision to remove someone, it is going to be debated through a partisan lens automatically because of this partisan finding, and he has already lost the confidence of a significant number in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427594"> Many opinion columns have been written, and rightly so, asking how the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> can continue on in his role when two of the major political parties say that he has lost confidence. This is not something that is par for the course. This does not happen every Parliament. This is the first time it has happened. It is a remarkable decline in Parliament, and he is presiding over it. If we are going to talk about people wasting the time of the House, he should have resigned already of his own accord, which is the honourable thing that he should have done. So, he cannot do his first role as he cannot neutrally preside over the proceedings of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427595">His second duty is as the chief administrative officer of the House. I did raise this issue in committee, in PROC, today. I also raised this with the <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">House leader of the NDP</Affiliation> in debate today, respectfully, but he did not answer the question, which is this: Honestly, how, given these partisan allegations, can the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> be the presiding officer over the House of Commons' harassment policy? How is that possible? </ParaText>

The current <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has operated his partisan breaches in the last six to eight months.

              <ParaText id="8427630"> Not only must the Speaker live by the letter of the law, he has to be seen to be living by the letter of the law on neutrality.

He was found to have made that breach by the procedure and House affairs committee of the House and fined. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427631">Yes, he profusely apologized to the House. Apparently, in the past, that would have resulted in a Speaker having resigned, but the House accepted a fine. However, two of the parties, the real official opposition, the Bloc and the Conservatives, because the NDP is in a coalition that jumps when the Liberals ask, with the seriousness of this, voted with the government to keep the Speaker in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427632">The British still maintain this neutrality. The U.K. Parliament says, “The political impartiality of the Speaker is one of the office's most important features – and most emulated or aspired to outside the UK. Once elected, the Speaker severs all ties with his or her former party and is in all aspects of the job a completely non-partisan figure.” That is not the process that our Speaker has been following in the breach. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427633">The breach we are talking about today, of course, is that we know that he put out a very partisan invitation to an event in the riding of Hull—Aylmer, which coincidentally happens to be the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s own riding. The government members would have us believe that the Speaker had nothing to do with the invitation to an event in his own riding. I do not know about other members, but I always review anything my EDA sends out in my riding. I would not let them put it out. It would be irresponsible for me to let it put them out, especially to an event like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427634">The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, in the invitation, described a summer evening with the hon. Speaker, scheduled to be held on the evening of June 4th in the shadow of Parliament Hill at a location adjacent to the Gatineau bank on the bank of the Ottawa River, less than a kilometre from here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427635">The promotional material of the event used very partisan, inflammatory language concerning the Conservative Party and the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. I will just read a little bit of it for members. It said, “Join us for an event in your community - you don't want to miss it! It's an opportunity to join fellow Liberals and talk about the ways we can continue to build a better future for all Canadians - because a better future starts with you.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427636">It goes on to say, “While [the Leader of the Opposition] and the Conservatives propose reckless policies that would risk [the] health, safety and pocketbooks [of] our Liberal team” because, of course, it is all about the pocketbooks of the Liberal team. It continues that it “is focused on making life more affordable for Canadians and moving forward with our bold plan to grow an economy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427637">The very partisan nature of this is actually emphasized in a footnote in the rhetoric, which explains that “Team [Prime Minister] events are posted by local volunteer teams”. That means that the locals in his riding posted this, not the claim that the government is making, which is that he was not responsible and that somebody else was responsible. It sounds like a six-year-old saying that their brother did it, that they did not do it, that they did not steal the chocolate bar, but their brother did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427638">That is unacceptable. The reason this is important is because the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has to protect the interest of the opposition in challenging the Crown. The Speaker is not a mouthpiece for the Crown. The Speaker is a protector of the rights of our democracy in this place, in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427639">It used to be that the NDP, not so long ago, agreed with that. I will quote, if one can bear with me for a minute, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>, the NDP House leader, who said, after the first incident, when it was at the procedure and House affairs committee, “This cannot happen moving forward.

We have a motion for the Speaker to vacate the chair. The NDP House leader said that this is what they would do if this happened again. It has happened again, but apparently the NDP has been whipped by the Liberal whip into keeping its coalition alive and betraying the words that it said to the public about what it would do going forward. Some might say that NDP members were Liberal lickspittles rather than members of the official opposition holding the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427641">Going forward, we know that, in the coalition government, one cannot depend on the NDP to protect the democratic interests of the House and the privileges of individuals.

              <ParaText id="8427649">However, I wonder if he could comment on something else that we have come to expect from the Speaker, because his role is essentially to make judgment calls on what is happening in the House. It is really all about exercising judgment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427651">Madam Speaker, obviously, judgment is a key part of any role in the House, and the judgment in this case, when one is Speaker, has to be to say, “No, I will not go to a partisan event; my role does not allow for that.” In fact, in the past, Speakers have left their party and sat as independent members when they became Speaker. That is a choice the current <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has to make in judgment, and he showed that his judgment errs on the side of partisanship, not on the side of being neutral. That is why he has to vacate the chair.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427663"> I cannot believe this is the second time in six months that this chamber has had to come to a halt to debate and ultimately rule on the fitness of the Speaker to continue. The impartiality of the Speaker is fundamental to this institution. This House is where 338 members of Parliament, elected to represent the people of Canada, come to legislate the laws of Canada. This is where vigorous debate occurs on bills proposed most of the time by the government, but also by private members and those from the other place. This is where the most powerful people in Canada are held to account. The votes in this place determine the continuation of the government. This is where, on a day-to-day basis, the most powerful people in Canada come to face an opposition. It is where their ideas have to be tested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427664">When bills are brought into this place, the process of debate is designed to be adversarial. It is designed to be partisan. If the government is going to propose a bill to change the laws of Canada and impose law on Canada, it has to be tested by an opposition. The only way the democratic privileges of Canadians can be protected is through an impartial Speaker whose impartiality is absolutely beyond reproach, yet here we are, for the second time in six months, debating whether that is the case with the current <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427665">I bring members to the latest issue and question of the impartiality of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, wherein the Speaker's Liberal electoral district association advertised a “Summer Evening with the [Speaker]” and talked about “fellow Liberals” joining with the Speaker to discuss issues. I will not repeat or read the portion of this invitation that had a very aggressive attack on the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427666">Anybody who read this invitation could see that this was an absolutely unpardonable departure from the norm of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s impartiality. As the member before me talked about, the impartiality of the Speaker has been well understood since the mid-17th century. This is not something new, and the entire system relies on this impartiality, so the invitation to this event alone is a departure from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427667">We have heard all day the speakers from the government say that this does not have anything to do with the Speaker at all and that this is from the Liberal Party. Really? There is a date on it. Are we left to believe that the Speaker did not know about this event that was advertised with his name on it on a particular date in his riding? Of course he had to have known about this. However, that may even be beside the point. Once a Speaker is elected, would not one of the very first things that any newly elected Speaker do be to sit down with the officials of the electoral district association for their party and tell them that they cannot advertise fundraising with the Speaker's name? They cannot do that. Everybody knows this. It is so simple. There is no excuse for it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427668">The Liberal Party may want to claim responsibility for this to deflect from the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, but no reasonable person would buy that the date in question had not been communicated to the Speaker. Is the EDA really going to have a fundraiser and put the Speaker's name on it to advertise it without checking to see if he is going to be available to attend? Of course they must have done that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427669"> The fact that this happened is why we are here today, but even if we could say this was a mistake, a one-off, by somebody who did not know better, the problem is that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has had a history of these types of events and no longer gets the benefit of the doubt. He does not get the benefit of the doubt when the House has already gone through a protracted question of privilege over his filming of a video in his Speaker's robes in the Speaker's office, which was played at a Liberal Party convention. He does not get the benefit of the doubt when this has already happened. When the debate on that earlier question was under way, the Speaker was in Washington attending another event, where he waxed nostalgic about his history of Liberal activism in a celebrity crowd of international Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427670"> I want to set that aside for a minute and ask what the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> was doing in Washington that week. That was a sitting week of the House of Commons. To the Speaker of the House of Commons, no other business is more important than a meeting of the House of Commons. Presiding over question period, presiding over important votes and presiding over the procedural issues that come up in Routine Proceedings each day are core responsibilities of the Speaker. There is no excuse for the Speaker to not be in the chair for these moments, other than incapacity and illness. If a Speaker is well enough to get out of bed and go out for the day, they are well enough to be in the chair when the House is sitting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427671">We have seen this over and over again. We have seen travel. We have seen the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> vacating the chair, probably, I am told, for diplomatic functions or meetings in the lounge. There is no excuse for these things. The Speaker ran on a platform to be Speaker, saying that nobody pays to see the ref; it is all about the players. However, under this Speaker, it has been about the Speaker, and that is just as offensive as the constant partisanship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427672">We have other examples of his partisanship. He attended an event for the Liberal member of the National Assembly in his riding. He got a former Liberal MP to write an op-ed to prop up his own standing and attack the Conservatives. Again, it is partisan attacks. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s job is not to care what the press gallery thinks or what the school kids in the gallery think or what anybody out there thinks of their conduct. The Speaker's role is to protect the privileges of members of the House of Commons. It is about protecting members. It is about ensuring that all of the people who elected the 338 members of the House of Commons have the tools and ability to hold the government to account and express their democratic will. That is the role of the Speaker, not hanging out with diplomats, not flying off to Washington and not any of the other things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427673">Despite the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s role of protecting members' privileges, we are still waiting for a ruling. Four weeks ago, a question of privilege was raised over the alteration of Hansard, and the Speaker still has not ruled on it. It is about time that we had a Speaker that will uphold the privileges of members of the House of Commons in an impartial fashion. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427685">I know I am supposed to split my time, but I usually look around to see if the member is in the chamber; he is behind me now.

I do not believe he is doing a great job. He has given ample opportunity for members of this House to not believe that he is able to conduct himself in a way that takes the Speaker's position and rises above the fray of the House. He said on the very first day or second day that he was like a new car and that he was hoping to avoid having dents in it. At this point, this thing is now in the scrapyard. It is done. There is nothing more to do. There is no way to fix this vehicle and give it a second life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427687">There have been three events. Other members have talked about them. The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> provided a provincial politician with a very partisan going-away video in Speaker's robes at a partisan convention. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278460" Type="2">Calgary Rocky Ridge</Affiliation> mentioned, the Speaker went to Washington, D.C. during a sitting week of the House in order to wax and wane about Liberal dogma. Now we have this latest issue of an email that was sent out inviting people in Hull—Aylmer, his riding, to an event where the Speaker was going to be. As other members, like my seatmate, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> said, it is impossible not to believe that the Speaker would not have known about that. All of us tell our EDAs what we want to know. I review every email a constituent gets from my office. If it goes out under my name, I see it automatically. It does not matter if it is EDA fundraisers sent by my EDA from the partisan emails we have. Nothing leaves my office without me seeing it. I look at those emails once my volunteers have set them up. I refuse to believe that the Speaker did not know. He can decline to take fault for it. If he wants to do that, that is fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427688"> In ethics, there are two things that matter: actual conflicts of interest and the perception of a conflict of interest. The same thing applies here. The perception of partisanship should be sufficient for any <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> to say to themselves, “I am not important”, just like I am not important as the member of Parliament for Calgary Shepard. None of us are. We are stewards of these seats on behalf of our constituents and for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427689"> The Speaker is the steward of that office, which is independent. We have been blessed to have had that office for hundreds of years in this country, thanks to Speaker Lenthall, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> reminded us. I have a print of a painting in my office so that when constituents come for a visit, I can talk about how important that was. It is a depiction of when King Charles I lost his head in the Palace of Westminster. It has a beautiful brass dot on the floor. You know about this, Madam Speaker, because you saw it with me; it was a wonderful experience to see that. It shows the exact place where King Charles I was executed, partially for invading this Parliament, trying to take it over and trying to arrest members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427690">The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>, every Speaker, needs to remember that it is not just about the pretty paintings they have in the hallway where the Speaker gets to walk around with the mace in a procession, wearing the robes, and having all of the clerks and analysts who help them do their job. Their job is literally to be a steward for the next generation, for the person who comes after them. The Speaker keeps forgetting that. It is just all about him; it has become about him. If he does not believe it is about him, in his heart of hearts, he should tell himself that his job is to protect the role and the job. The only honourable thing to do would be to resign before the vote is taken to protect that office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427691"> I have a Yiddish proverb. I wrote it down, because I always have one when I am speaking. I went looking for it.

The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has chosen his old friend, the Liberal Party. I find it unusual that Liberal members of Parliament are throwing the Liberal Party of Canada under the bus.

              <ParaText id="8427692"> Everybody in the party apparatus in the Liberal offices is in some way at fault for sending out a partisan email that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> should have looked at. The staff in the Speaker's office should have realized it could not go out in his name under any circumstances. Obviously, they did not catch it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427693"> I will also say that his name was not on my ballot. I refused to put him on my ballot because this particular <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has been very partisan in his role. I do not fault him for it. There are many partisan members here. Partisanship is part of being a member of Parliament, and I accept that. I had the names ordered in a different way, as you know, Madam Speaker. You know exactly who was my first choice on that ballot, who was my second choice and who was my third choice. You know why as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427694"> I have found, with Speakers in the past, and I have had a few Speakers now who have been responsible for the House, as a spectator, that Speaker Milliken was probably the best modern Speaker the House has had. I think that is a widely shared opinion. He was a Liberal member of Parliament who became the Speaker. It almost did not matter which party one was in, he was generally approved. I think even the clerks and the analysts of the different committees think so too. I have even looked at videos of his past decisions on how he behaved in the House and controlled it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427695"> I would say that in the United Kingdom the most interesting Speaker of late was Speaker Bercow, who was renowned for trying to keep order in the House with his shouting down of members and his quips. It worked for him in his situation. However, this particular <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has never been able to restore confidence after the errors he has made, and he does not give me more confidence that it can get better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427696"> I will also add that, when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> tried to amend the motion we are considering to make it a secret ballot vote, just like when we elect a Speaker, she was shouted down by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>. He was the first member to start saying no over her as she was trying to read her motion. He did not even wait until she was done to say no, but did it while she was trying to add a very reasonable amendment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427697">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> is the same member who, when speaking to journalists on behalf of the New Democratic Party, after the review by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs of the issue, said, “This cannot happen moving forward. From now on, you cannot have a Speaker engage in partisan activity.” He also said, “if there was any derogation from that, in the weeks and months to come”, that his party would join in voting “non-confidence” in the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427698">That is essentially what we are doing right now. We want the Speaker to vacate the seat. I personally believe that is the right solution here because the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has chosen his old friend, specifically the Liberal Party. I do not mean the individual caucus members here, because I am sure some of them, if allowed a free vote, would also believe that he has simply lost the confidence of the House. About half of the members here do not believe he can do the job. Any Speaker in that situation, just like any CEO or chair of a board of directors, should then say that they could not continue in their role and step down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427699">I have chaired Conservative caucus meetings. If members think we are rambunctious in public, wait until they see us in private and how difficult it is to chair a meeting of the Conservative caucus with our senators. I survived for two and a half years. My members knew that there were many times when I came very close to making a decision as to whether I could continue as the chair of my own caucus, so I set the limits of what was acceptable in our caucus meetings and what the rules were. This <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> cannot do that because we do not have confidence in his ability to be non-partisan in the role. He allows emails to be sent out that are partisan in nature and then pretends he did not know about it. He travels overseas, goes to Washington, D.C., and waxes on about Liberal dogma. He made a video on behalf of Liberal politicians in Speaker's robes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427700">If it was just a one-time thing, I could absolve him of that sin, but he very obviously is choosing his old friend, the Liberal Party of Canada, which is now protecting him as well, instead of choosing his new friends, those of us who are looking to him to be a neutral, non-partisan referee. In his own words, he is like an unblemished car with maybe a dent or two so far. That car is now in the wrecking yard because he has chosen his old friends. He cannot continue. I invite the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> to resign before the vote.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427713">It seems to me that the member respects due process. He should be directing his comments to the Liberal Party of Canada, not to the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, and I am concerned about, not his approach, but many of his colleagues' attacking the Speaker, when he knows that the rules of the House are such that we cannot attack the Speaker or decisions.

              <ParaText id="8427715">Madam Speaker, if members think ethics and integrity are important, I think most Canadians would be stunned at the fact that we would have to say, “six strikes and he should be out”. We are still here, six strikes in on the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House</Affiliation>, over and over again, as the Liberal MPs mock and just say, “Why not ten?” They have such a low bar they have set for themselves that we are here again today. The Speaker has been in the role for eight months, and there are numerous examples, time and time again, of his being incapable of being neutral, impartial, and non-partisan. Let me talk about the six strikes from my perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427716">We are aware of what happened late last year. The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> had the extremely poor judgment to record a video in the Speaker's office, in his Speaker's robes, talking at the Ontario Liberal Party convention, doing a video praising another Liberal. It is completely unacceptable. The second strike was when the Speaker did an interview, cited in his role as Speaker in The Globe and Mail, regarding Mr. John Fraser, to whom he paid tribute by video. He referred, in his role as Speaker, to the Ontario Liberal Party as “our party”. It is completely unacceptable and just common sense not to do that as a Speaker of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427717"> If that were not bad enough, right in that time frame, the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> decided, when the House was sitting, to take a trip to Washington, D.C. It is nearly unheard of for the Speaker of the House of Commons to leave the country when the House is sitting, let alone when under a cloud of scandal, calls for his resignation and debate about his future. It was poor judgment to leave the country, not just when the House was sitting but also when he was under a cloud of investigation, scandal, criticism, and calls for his resignation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427718">One would think that would be enough, but it goes on. He gets to Washington, D.C., as Speaker, goes to a private retirement party for a friend instead of being in the House of Commons, and gets caught on video talking about his partisan, Young Liberals of Canada history and how great those times were back in the day, and celebrating his Liberal roots. This is literally while he is under calls for his resignation for time and time again not showing impartiality but showing bias and partisanship towards the Liberal Party. That is number three of the six strikes we are now at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427719">Number four is the photos that came out right around the time that PROC finished its investigation, showing that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> attended a Quebec Liberal Party fundraiser locally, just across the river. When one is Speaker, they should not go to partisan fundraisers for political parties of any jurisdiction. That has just been the common-sense consensus of every Speaker we have had in this country for over 150 years. That is a strike again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427720">Now we get to where we are when the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>, knowing the amount of criticism that has been lobbed rightfully against him, gets caught using such partisan language on an invitation to a partisan Liberal fundraiser for himself that it would make the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> blush, probably. It is not just an accident to do all of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427721">Here is the thing that is interesting. After all of what I have just laid out, the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> promised, because the NDP propped him up, that this would never happen again. He said that he would put procedures in place to make sure that it would never happen again, and that he would be be completely impartial. This was just a rough start, and he wanted a new slate to do it all over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427722"> One would have thought that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> would have gone back to his riding association as he organized fundraisers, and thought, “Maybe we should watch the way we word our invitations.” I am not one to give free political advice to anybody on the other side of the aisle, particularly when it comes to fundraising, but nobody forced the Speaker to hold the fundraiser.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427723">He had promised to have procedures in place so this would never happen again. He could have simply mailed a letter out from the president of his riding association saying, “Our Speaker is busy being the Speaker and should be non-partisan. I am John Smith, the president of the Hull—Aylmer Liberal Association. Donate $100 to help out our local candidate in the next election.” It would have been free advice that would not have gotten him in trouble. However, it was put in an event, and here we are again. That was strike number five, and I am not done yet.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427724">The sixth strike was today. I am a member of the procedure and House affairs committee. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> appeared today to talk about the topic of violence and harassment prevention policies of the House, PROC, Board of Internal Economy and so forth. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> had an exchange with the Speaker about his past, his judgment and his actions of being overly partisan, and that it was on the floor of the House of Commons that the Speaker wrongfully defended the Prime Minister when he was not accused of but admitted to elbowing the chest of an NDP MP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427725"> What frustrated me as I sat in the room and listened was what the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> said in response to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>'s calling him out, saying the Speaker questioned the former member's integrity and her events of the story, literally mocked her on the floor of the House of Commons minutes later and suggested she took a dive reminiscent of something in the World Cup. He was called out for it. In the committee today, and anybody can go and watch the exchange, he said, “I can tell you that I never questioned Ruth Ellen Brosseau's accounting of the situation.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427726">He literally stood up on the floor of the House of Commons, and it was infamous because he mocked her, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had to apologize. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> never did. Here he was today, when he was confronted about that situation, and I have to be careful of the words I use in the House so I do not get a point of order, and what he said in his response was completely false. People can listen to what he said that day only a few years ago, and can watch the footage from the cameras in here. That is strike number six.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427727"> In 150 years, this country has now had 38 speakers. The current speaker is the 38th. I am not saying they have all been completely innocent. There have been blemishes. There have been issues. However, to have a Speaker with so many accusations against him of being partisan, having poor judgment, showing bias, and of not being neutral and impartial, and to have a couple of strikes, is not good. Some people say, “Three strikes and you're out.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427728">We are at six strikes. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has not been here for eight years; he has been here for eight months. We have had Speakers who have served for about 10 ten years. Peter Milliken was raised earlier. He did not have eight issues and ethical violations in a matter of 10 years. The current Speaker has six strikes against him, from what I have outlined here tonight, in eight months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427729"> The question needs to be, “Who is the common denominator?” Liberal MPs have gone on to be Speaker before, with success in being able to balance. When the Speaker is elected, there is a tradition that the Speaker gets dragged in by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, dragged to the chair. That tradition is the fun part that everybody sees on TV.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427730">Nobody forced the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> to run in the first place. He did not ask me for my opinion, and it is probably better that he did not. I kind of wish that he had, because I would have told him that I did not think he was the best fit for the job, because whether it was in the ethics committee or public accounts over the years, time and time again, he was constantly unflinching in his defence of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party, no matter what. It was a recipe for disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427731">We need to have a Speaker in the chair who can be respected, command the respect of the House and allow us to get to business. We are here tonight not because of Conservatives. We are here because the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, over and over again, has violated trust and has violated the code that for 150-plus years has not resulted in issues. The simple thing I will say again is that it is time for the Speaker to resign. Let us put a new Speaker in the chair, one who can unite the House and focus on the democratic importance we have in the chamber.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427773">An important part of our role is to elect an impartial Speaker. Obviously, we have erred. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has blind spots that are too large to paper over. The last time we had a violation of this magnitude, we talked about procedure, saying that it was going to go through a certain lens, that we were going to have certain people informed. However, there is another group. Interestingly, when I was preparing for my speech and talking to some of my colleagues, pages came up, and I started talking about the role of a page. Do members know that not a single page has been fired this term? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427774">Pages, for the people watching at home, are the people who help us. They bring over important documents. They let us know if a guest is here. They facilitate the debate. An important role for them is to be impartial. The first thing they learn in page school is that they have to be impartial. They cannot post on social media. They cannot share an opinion publicly. If they do, they are fired. Not a single page has been fired from this place because they take their role seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427775">How this relates to the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>, which is an interesting twist, is that he was a page at one time. I think he knows what is right and wrong, but unfortunately he keeps picking the wrong decision, not once, not twice, but six times. We are soon to find out about a seventh time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427776">To the NDP members who will be voting in this, I would say, historic vote, our debates here cannot happen without an impartial Speaker. It is one of the most important roles we have, so we need a Speaker we can trust, not one who is an agent of the Crown. That Crown, unfortunately, with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his unholy alliance with the NDP, is lacking in common sense. This lack of common sense is, I think, born into these members. It is the common sense to know that if one is the referee, one cannot take part in partisan activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427777">As pointed out earlier, I was once honoured to hold this position in Saskatchewan. I was the 25th Speaker of the Saskatchewan legislature. It was an honour, and it is a peak of my career that I do not know if I will ever surpass. I loved that job; I loved it with all my heart. However, there was another calling that was greater: this country. I was worried about the country that my two boys were going to inherit after the ruinous Liberal Party was done with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427778">What did I do? Knowing that I could not be in a partisan role as Speaker, I put down my robes. I resigned my speakership so that I could take part in a partisan event, which was the nomination for my seat. I did that because I hold ethics, being impartial, being a referee, to a much higher role than just someone who wears a pointy hat and funny robes. However, even that is important. Madam Speaker, you wear those robes because they identify you as someone different who holds that seat in this chamber. It is something special to be identified with the uniform of a Speaker. It is therefore with a heavy heart that I ask the current <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> to lay down his robes.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8427798"> Madam Speaker, we know that the role of the Speaker carries great responsibility in the House. It is critical to the functioning of our democratic institution. The Speaker has a duty to enforce the rules and the traditions of the House, whether written or not. The Speaker has the responsibility to maintain order and to preside over debates. The Speaker is also entrusted to safeguard the rights and the privileges of all members in the House. It is a role that carries great influence and great power, a role that requires a high level of trust in the individual that holds the office. That is why it is imperative that the Speaker carry the role of impartiality. To act otherwise is a breach of the trust that is required of the Speaker. That is where we find ourselves today: The trust between the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> and the members of the House has been broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427799">Once again, the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has shown complete disregard for the neutrality required of him in the role that he holds. The Liberal Party's advertisement of “A Summer Evening with the Honourable [Member]” was overtly partisan. There is no question about its partisan nature. It contained language and messaging that was clearly inciting about the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party. It is no surprise that the Liberal Party has come rushing in, trying to shield and to defend the Speaker. However, it is the Speaker who allowed his name to be used to promote the event. In doing so, he tied the office that he holds to the language and partisan messaging used in the invitation. That is unacceptable. The appropriateness of his actions are not even in question here. The Speaker did not maintain the neutrality required of him in this role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427800">In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="279182" Type="96">Deputy Speaker</Affiliation> has now ruled that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> acted in a partisan manner. Therefore, it is already decided that the Speaker acted inappropriately. His pattern of behaviour is simply unacceptable. It is my opinion that the Speaker must resign. If he does not, then he must be removed. Without the confidence of members of the House, the Speaker cannot be trusted to govern this place in a manner that is fair and that is also impartial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427801">Let us be clear: As has been stated over and over again this evening, this is not strike one, strike two or strike three for the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>. This is a pattern of behaviour. I know that all members of the House will recall when the Speaker used his official Speaker's robes, his office and his title in an unquestionably partisan video broadcast at an Ontario Liberal Party event. That he used his office and the title that he holds to further partisan efforts was a clear violation of his role. That was then followed by partisan speeches in Washington, D.C., delivered using his title as Speaker of the House of Commons, where he reminisced about his days as a young Liberal. Of course, we know that the Speaker has also spoken at neighbouring ridings' Liberal fundraising events. If there was any trust left after any of these single incidents, it has only been further shattered after each and every one. It also makes us question whether there have been other violations that just have not come to light as of yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427802">The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has now repeatedly failed to uphold the neutrality and impartiality that is required of the office he holds. After so many incidents, it cannot be argued in a believable way that it was simply an oversight. The Speaker has intent. He has shown to Canadians and to members of the House his intent to use his office to further his partisan interests. In fact, this pattern of behaviour actually creates more doubt and more questions about how the Speaker wields his power and authority in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427803">The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>'s decision to oust the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">opposition leader</Affiliation> from the chamber for the use of the word “wacko” is quite fresh in everyone's mind. That was a notable ruling from the Chair that stands out even more given the free pass that is regularly given to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for the use of similar language. Given the pattern of behaviour that has been established, are Canadians and we as members of Parliament expected to believe that a decision of that nature was not motivated by partisanship? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427804">The Liberal government seems quite comfortable with the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>'s behaviour. While his partisan endeavours suit the Liberal government's interests, I think Canadians would have hoped they too understand that a hyperpartisan Speaker undermines the integrity of our democratic institution, an institution that we all have a shared duty to uphold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427805">Perhaps what is most concerning is the position that the Liberals' NDP partners have taken. The NDP seem to be very forgiving of the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>'s repeated actions, despite assertions previously made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>. It was not that long ago that after the Speaker delivered his remarks at a Liberal Party of Ontario event, which, as members will recall, was done in his official robes from the Speaker's office using his title of Speaker, the member for New Westminster—Burnaby went on public record putting a line in the sand for the NDP. He told Canadians that the NDP would call for the Speaker to step down if such an incident were to happen again. Well, it has happened again, and the Deputy Speaker's ruling confirms this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427806">The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> has acted in a clearly partisan manner, but that line in the sand from the NDP has now suddenly disappeared and is nowhere to be seen. That empty threat from the NDP was also accompanied by excuses that the Speaker was improperly briefed in his role. In fact, the member went so far as to suggest that this was a shortcoming of our institution itself. That excuse from the NDP somehow suggests that the Speaker could not be expected to know that participating in hyperpartisan activities would be inappropriate, and that in doing so, he would be undermining the institution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427807">I would expect that any individual who holds the office of Speaker possesses sound judgment. That is a minimal trait that should be expected of the Speaker, who presides and makes rulings in this House. Regardless, the excuse of not knowing cannot be used over and over again. The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> must take responsibility for his actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427808">While it is not shocking that the NDP is yet again eager to protect its Liberal masters, it is nonetheless shameful. It is absolutely imperative that the Speaker of the House, regardless of their party affiliation, carry out their role in a manner that is impartial and neutral. That neutrality ensures that the Speaker can maintain the trust of all members in the House. It is what fosters good order in this place, and it gives credibility to and confidence in the rulings that are made by the Chair. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427809">That trust has been lost, and the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation>'s continued defiance of the neutrality required of him has shattered any hope of it being repaired. The Liberal government and its NDP coalition partners have a responsibility to protect our democratic institution. They cannot continue to defend the unacceptable partisan conduct of the Speaker. Only with a new, non-partisan Speaker can we restore the trust that has been broken and get on with the important business of the House. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427818">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>. As I have mentioned in the House, I have had the pleasure of living across the country, from one side to the other, from Victoria to northern Alberta and even in Newfoundland for a while. Therefore, Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> hits a bit close for me, so I am very pleased to speak to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427819">To sum up Newfoundland, I will tell members of an experience I had. One day in Edmonton, I was door knocking for the first campaign in 2015. A lot of Newfoundlanders live in my riding of Edmonton West, or as I call it, “Edmonton West Edmonton Mall”. A couple was in the garage. It was a hot day and the garage door was open. They were sitting having a beer inside their garage, and we started chatting. They said they were from Newfoundland, and I said I used to live in St. John's, so we started chatting. They invited me to have a beer, so I sat down with them. We had a nice beer together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427820">A couple of years later, during the horrible forest fires in Fort McMurray, where, of course, a lot of people from Newfoundland were living, the residents had to evacuate. This couple had taken in a couple from Fort McMurray, who also were Newfoundlanders. I was at an event one night at the Good Shepherd Church. It was a fundraising event. I ran into this couple, and they introduced me to this other couple who they were housing. They were complete strangers, but because they were Newfoundlanders, they were happy to take in this couple. We started chatting and they said they were from St. John's. I said that I used to live there and they asked where. I said I used to live on Bindon Place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427821">It turned out that they were my former neighbours. This couple lived in the lot right behind our house. Back then, if anyone has ever lived in St. John's, they would know it has very lovely winters with lots of snow. The first year I lived there, we had 22 feet of snow, a record amount of snow. It was not until June that I found out we actually had an eight-foot fence in our backyard. This couple was laughing about living behind us. I had to laugh because, at the time, we had this beautiful dog named Doonesbury. He was the world's greatest dog. He would wander on these huge snowbanks, from yard to yard because, of course, the snow was way above the fence. It turned out that he had often visited their yard to do his business, so it was years later that I had the opportunity to apologize for my dog.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427822">There are a few things I would note about people from Newfoundland. They really never leave the rock. I worked in Fort McMurray for a while, and we had the largest club at the time, the Newfoundland club. When we would meet in Fort McMurray, they all had the same wish; they wanted to be able to go back home to work and to get good jobs, which of course were not available. That is why they were in Fort McMurray. When I lived in Newfoundland, every time I travelled to the mainland or away, usually to Nova Scotia where our regional office was, and then flew back to St. John's, I would land at about midnight at the airport, and there were always about 50 to 70 people, families holding up signs and welcoming back their family members, who were mostly coming from Alberta because of work. Since taking over this job nine years ago, I have probably returned to the Edmonton airport 300 to 400 times, and not once has anyone been waiting there for me with a sign. With Newfoundlanders, it was always like that. It was quite amazing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427823">It is a beautiful city. I enjoyed my time living there, although I cannot say the same about the weather with the massive amounts of snow. I remember that on the May long weekend, I was flying to Nova Scotia; I think it was May 21. The day before, in Halifax, there was a record high of 36°C. I was waiting in St. John's for my wife to come home with the car and drive me to the airport. We had a snowstorm, and she got the car stuck in the driveway in a snowbank. She walked in with our two kids, who were about one and two years old at the time. With tears streaming, she said that she was leaving me and was moving back to Victoria. That almost sums up the weather. However, I noticed a month later, in late June, that we were shovelling the snow in the driveway, and in the back of the house where there was sun, we were mowing the backyard. That is the weather in Newfoundland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427824">Everywhere I have lived, I have run into people from Newfoundland who want to get back to the rock, but they want good jobs. Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> I do not see delivering that. There are quite a few flaws in the bill. I want to go over some of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427825">Clause 19 of Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> would open the door to more red tape and likely to delays. We have heard repeatedly about a lack of investment and productivity in this country. It takes 15 to 20 years to get a mine approval and years to get a housing approval. In Alberta, we see people not wanting to invest in the country because they know the red tape and the approval process make it so slow. Clause 19 is going to add to that and going to discourage investment. It would shift decision-making power and licence approvals to the federal and provincial ministers, while tripling the amount of time the decision can take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427826">The government often talks about how we need experts to make the decisions, yet this bill will take power away from experts and regulators and put it into the hands of the very partisan and biased <Affiliation DbId="299995" Type="4">natural resources minister</Affiliation>. Can members imagine anyone who is involved in resource investment in this country looking at our current <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> or natural resources minister and saying that Canada looks like a great place to invest in because they can trust their opinions? Of course not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427827"> Clause 28 would give the federal minister, with the approval of the provincial minister, the power to outright ban drilling in certain areas and to even halt projects that are already approved and in progress. That sounds a bit like Kinder Morgan and Trans Mountain. That was approved, and it was going to spend billions of dollars just to find out that the government can retroactively change the rules. Who wants to invest in this environment? Who wants to create good jobs in this kind of an environment? If the bill were to pass with clause 28 as written, it would put an end to offshore petroleum drilling in Atlantic Canada, killing good-paying jobs for workers and further strengthening eastern Canada's dependence on foreign oil imports from dictatorships like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8427828"> We have seen how the government treats resource projects in this country. Section 61 and 62 would invariably be abused by the government, and they would attach so many strings that approval for projects would become unfeasible. Does anyone remember energy east? We have TransCanada ready to spend billions of dollars so we can bring Alberta oil and Saskatchewan oil out east to get the eastern provinces off of U.S. oil and off of dictator oil. Instead, the government threw up so many roadblocks and changed the goalposts so many times, it ended up cancelling the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427829">Section 61 and 62 would bring the unconstitutional Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> into the review process, allowing the minister to attach any conditions they see fit to an approval. Sections from the Impact Assessment Act, previously Bill C-69, also known as the no-new-pipeline bill, have been put into Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>. On October 13, 2023, the Supreme Court ruled Bill C-69 largely unconstitutional. The federal government has not fixed those sections to date. If Bill C-49 is passed, as written, it would include 32 references to sections of Bill C-69 that the Supreme Court identified as unconstitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427830">Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document> also includes the discretionary decision-making power of the minister and the entirety of the designated project scheme, both of which are unconstitutional, so components of Bill C-49 may also be unconstitutional. Section 64 of Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> was deemed unconstitutional, and is referenced throughout Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>, which allows the minister to interfere in a project they think is in the public interest and create any conditions they deem necessary to which the project proponent must comply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427831">We, in Alberta, know full well what the government does to resource projects. We know full well how it works against resource projects. Of course, we had Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>, the so-called just transition bill, which we called the unjust transition bill. It would be absolutely devastating to Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427832">I want to give members some numbers the conference board put together. Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document> would destroy 91,000 jobs in Alberta. That is a 58% increase in Alberta's jobless rate. There would be a decline in our GDP of almost 4%, and a 50% bigger hit than the 2008 financial crisis. Alberta revenue would be chopped up to $127 billion over 10 years. That is almost a 20% drop per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427833">We see very clearly the Liberal government's intention toward our natural resources. It is kill the resources at all costs, send Canadians into poverty, hurt Alberta, hurt Newfoundland, and hurt resource-producing provinces, which is why we will not vote for Bill <Document DbId="12458211" Type="3">C-49</Document>.</ParaText>

We know that we are talking about the generation of potentially billions of dollars of future investment. We have Conservatives, in particular Conservative members of Parliament from Atlantic Canada, denying that we have premiers in Atlantic Canada, a Progressive Conservative premier and a Liberal premier, who are waiting for this legislation to pass, and then they pass mirroring legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8427838"> Madam Speaker, the interesting thing about the proposed bill and the member's speech is that, in addition to the four elements of the IAA being incorporated into it, it was introduced in June of last year, and within four weeks, the Newfoundland government was issuing tenders for exploration licences. They do that every summer, and every summer they get responses. Last year, after the bill was introduced, the “no-capital bill”, as I call it, there were zero applications in Newfoundland, and those applications went to the Gulf of Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8427839">I know the member has a lot of experience with what the IAA can do to destroy energy projects out west. Does he think it is going to continue that trend that we saw last summer?</ParaText>

I represent Prince Edward Island. When I first ran in 2011, Stephen Harper was the prime minister. He repeatedly and steadfastly refused to invest in a third cable that would have allowed power to come from Point Lepreau in New Brunswick over to Prince Edward Island, a place that did not have its own resources except for wind. As soon as we came into power, we fixed that. Here we are, 14 years later, and the Conservative Party is upholding its tradition of opposition for renewable energy in Prince Edward Island.</ParaText>

They threw out the provincial Liberal government and put in a Conservative government. We can look at Newfoundland. A Liberal riding last night held a by-election, and they went to the people and asked whom they trust on jobs. The Liberal vote dropped 50%. The Conservative vote went up to a point that Kim Jong-Un in North Korea would be envious of. The people decided, and they are deciding for the Conservatives.</ParaText>
