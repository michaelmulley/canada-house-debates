What could have easily become the St. Lawrence's worst maritime tragedy in a very long time was avoided thanks to Maxime Boulay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512128">Four of the five men ended up under the boat. Only Maxime managed to hold on to the upside-down hull. Numb from the ice-cold water, he dialled 911 and also managed to call the nearest boat, belonging to Steeve Boulay. Then, one by one, he pulled his four co-workers back onto the hull and kept them out of the water with him. Twenty minutes later, Steeve Boulay's boat and his crew brought them back to shore. Still reeling from the shock, some no longer want to go back out to sea, but at least they are all alive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512129">The entire Bloc Québécois team would like to commend Maxime on his mental strength and courage. Without him, four Quebeckers would have left us. Well done, Maxime Boulay, and thank you.</ParaText>

The family will continue the company's tradition of excellence in honour of their dedicated parents.</ParaText>

If one is indigenous, it is worse still, with one in three living in poverty. According to the MDI, a poverty metric that is widely used in Europe, 30% of 18- to 30-year-olds, 44.5% of single-parent households and 42% of renters cannot afford two or more household essentials. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512156">The Liberal government's own carbon tax data shows that the scheme costs every household in Canada almost $2,000 and has deprived the country of $30.5 billion in lost economic activity. While the Liberals raise taxes, more and more Canadians are falling into poverty. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> is not worth the cost.

              <ParaText id="8512497">Mr. Speaker, Conservatives on the defence committee are submitting dissenting reports and opinions for both of the reports from the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512498">As we learned at the procurement study, the global threat environment is increasingly precarious. The decision by the government to cut $1 billion a year over the next three years from the defence budget is unconscionable. We are asking that the government reverse that budget cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512499">We are asking for more leadership coming from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Prime Minister's Office. We believe that we have to have more ministers who are actually in control and accountable. That includes having a secretary within the PCO and a prime minister who actually takes this seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512500">We are asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to designate one minister to be ultimately accountable for all defence procurement. We are also calling on the government to grant members of the defence committee classified defence-related information and clearances so that we can do a better job of oversight and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512501">I would also just want to say, on the issue of aid to civil power, which we also talked about, one of the important messages that we did hear when the committee was meeting is that, while part IV of the National Defence Act does outline that CAF can provide aid to civil power, it always should be the force of last resort. It is ultimately the responsibility of provincial, municipal and territorial governments to provide protection, and they need to invest more in mitigation and response assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512502">We also know that the Canadian Armed Forces are dealing with a retention and recruitment crisis, about which General Eyre was very blunt in his assessment. He said, “The demand signal for those primary tasks we're responsible for is only increasing. However, our readiness to do that is decreasing, due in part to the incessant demand for these types of domestic operations.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512503">Therefore, we are asking again that the budget cut be reversed and that we restore the $2.7 billion that was announced in September 2023. We also say that we want to see the private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="12964591" Type="4">C-386</Document>, an act respecting the establishment and award of a special service medal for domestic and emergency relief operations, from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, be accepted by the government and concurred in, and that we can recognize those Canadians who step up to participate in domestic operations, such as disaster assistance, pandemic relief and other avenues, and recognize their contributions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512504">Also, we are saying that there should be an increase in youth involvement in aiding and assisting in civilian volunteer disaster relief.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512511">As the NDP's food price inflation critic, I have responded by getting the agriculture committee to look at this issue and hold rich grocery CEOs to account.

              <ParaText id="8512512">Today, I am pleased to rise and introduce the national framework for food price transparency act. This legislation would require the Minister of Industry, in consultation with the provinces, to develop a national framework on grocery pricing, unit display practices, transparency on price increases, and promoting unit pricing education to consumers across Canada. There would also be a requirement for the minister to table a report in Parliament, so we can keep the government accountable on the framework.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512543"> She said: Mr. Speaker, Canada is home to over 5,600 campgrounds that are enjoyed by over 70% of Canadians who actively participate in outdoor and wilderness activities. These businesses employ over 140,000 Canadians and operate on very thin margins, making reinvestment for their facilities and upkeep hard to manage. My riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex is home to many campgrounds, and I have heard from people across this country that they are being treated unfairly as small seasonal businesses. The story is universal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512544"> After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, life is unaffordable and Canadian small businesses deserve a break. That is why I am glad today to table an act to amend the Income Tax Act for campgrounds. The change proposed in the bill will allow campgrounds extra capital to use toward conservation, facilities maintenance, managing wildlife, recovery from the elements and increasing services to their campers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512545">Once again, Conservatives are providing common-sense solutions that will cut back on punishing taxes, help grow our small businesses like campgrounds, and give Canadian families more opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512547"> He said: Mr. Speaker, today I am tabling legislation to protect Canada's forests and places of worship from arson. My bill, the anti-arson act, will create two new offences in the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512548">The first offence increases the maximum sentence for causing a wildfire to 18 years, and for subsequent offences to 18 years. After nine years, the Liberal-NDP government has failed to protect Canadians from the rising threat of wildfires. Over half of wildfires are human-caused. Many of these fires are ignited by arsonists from Nova Scotia, to British Columbia and everywhere in between. These fires have led to evacuations, destruction of private and public property, expensive firefighting costs to the taxpayer, increased carbon emissions and significant health repercussions from smoke.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512549"> The second offence introduces a minimum sentence of five years in prison for a first offence and seven years for repeat offences of damage to a place of worship by fire or explosion. Over 100 churches have been burned, desecrated or vandalized since 2021. Last month, the Jewish synagogue Schara Tzedeck, in Vancouver, suffered an arson attack, leaving community members shocked and horrified. In Peterborough, a mosque was torched by an arsonist and suffered tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Ex-president Kenzu Abdella stated that the issue needs to be taken seriously by all levels of government and that the crime should carry a serious enough consequence to potentially deter arsonists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512550"> Churches, mosques, synagogues and temples are more than buildings. These places of worship are where Canadians go to find strength, fellowship with God and others. Pyro-terrorist attacks are an assault on their entire faith community and undermine Canadians' sense of security and freedom. Canadians of any faith should never wake up to find out that their sanctuary has been criminally destroyed. Conservatives will defend their freedom of worship and assembly from pyro-terrorism.</ParaText>

They note that over the past decade, 85% of warming from greenhouse gases has come from burning fossil fuels, that the oil and gas sector is the largest emitter in the country and that the federal government in 2021 committed to an oil and gas cap. Petitioners then call on the government to move forward immediately with a bold emissions cap for the oil and gas sector that is comprehensive in scope and realistic in achieving an interim and science-based target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512560">Mr. Speaker, the next petition I would like to present is with respect to safety for truck drivers. In 2020, the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators issued standard 16 with respect to entry-level training under the National Safety Code. As part of this, provinces and territories are meant to implement these, but only five have done so to date. As a result, the training requirements vary widely across the country and there is a bit of a patchwork of training requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512561">Petitioners note that nearly 2,000 Canadians are killed and 10,000 are injured in collisions involving commercial trucks, with most victims being occupants of other vehicles, and that the federal government can issue regulations to ensure more uniform road safety requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512562">Petitioners have three calls. The first is to establish a national mandatory training standard as mandated by standard 16 and implemented by all provinces through federal legislation or regulation. The second is to mandate that each province and territory be obliged to ensure that their training complies with this standard. The third is that each province and territory be obligated to oversee and enforce the universal standard for all commercial truck drivers using the roads.</ParaText>

Vorasidenib is a life-extending medication currently only available in the United States. It remains inaccessible to Canadians. The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to improve access to brain cancer treatments by empowering Health Canada to expedite the use of patient and laboratory in vitro data to expand access to drugs for brain cancer treatment where clinical trials are not feasible and develop a regulatory model that would permit the approval of brain cancer treatment medications that can extend patients' lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512566">The second petition is with respect to pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is a rare, life-threatening condition. Recent results from the STELLAR clinical trials offer new hope for patients, and the petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to urge Health Canada to approve sotatercept, a significant milestone in the treatment option for PAH, without further delay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512567">The third petition is on the same topic of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The petition talks about patients needing timely access to new therapies. Therefore, the petitioners are calling on the federal government to allocate funding now to the provinces so that new treatments can be made available quickly to Canadians living with this rare disease and that the federal government have a holistic approach to rare diseases that includes early detection and prevention, timely and equitable access to evidence-based care, enhanced community support, and the promotion of innovative research.</ParaText>

It would especially harm remote, rural, indigenous and resource-based communities, provinces and regions; blue-collar and lower-income workers; and indigenous and diverse Canadians, who will face higher job disruptions and more challenges finding new opportunities because they work in Canada's oil and gas sector at a much higher rate than in other sectors. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512590">When the Liberals provided the carbon tax relief to Canadians living in areas where their polling numbers were dropping, they showed their true colours.

              <ParaText id="8512591">The reality is the carbon tax is impacting all Canadians, contributing to higher prices and making life less affordable for everyone; not just on home heating, but in other ways as well. In Westman, with the cost of food soaring, Samaritan House food bank organizers saw almost a 50% increase in the number of hampers they gave out, reaching a total of 36,000.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512604">Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of Canadians is Health Canada’s top priority, and the department exercises stringent regulatory oversight over vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512605">Before the initial approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the department completed a rigorous scientific review of the product’s safety, efficacy and quality, including details on manufacturing processes and information on adverse events following immunization. An authorization was only issued once Health Canada confirmed the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks of its use. The summary basis of decision can be found at this link: https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/info/summary-basis-decision-detailTwo.html?linkID=SBD00510.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512606">During the review of the information submitted by the manufacturer, Health Canada became aware of the potential presence of residual DNA in the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine preparation. However, the content of the residual DNA was below 10 nanograms/dose. The content of residual DNA was lower than the recommended limits established by the World Health Organization, WHO, in consultation with subject matter experts. Accordingly, the department did not request genotoxicity studies, as the residual DNA was considered a low risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512607">Furthermore, the department reviews the manufacturing data for each vaccine lot that is released for use in Canada to ensure they meet their established specifications, including those for residual DNA. The amounts of residual DNA in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine lots were reported to Health Canada, as well as to our international partner agencies: e.g., EMA and U.S. FDA. Both Health Canada and our international partners consider the test methods used by Pfizer-BioNTech for detecting that residual DNA to be scientifically sound and appropriate for their intended use. As well, the results from the residual DNA tests were consistent among different vaccine lots sold both in Canada and elsewhere and were also consistent with other manufacturing data provided in support of the release of each product lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512608">With regard to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine manufacturing process, an SV40 enhancer-promoter region was present in the DNA plasmid template, but has no functional role and is not upstream of any SV40 gene, and the DNA template is digested and filtered to remove from the mRNA vaccine. Health Canada cannot speculate on any intentions by Pfizer-BioNTech in regard to whether they removed the SV40 sequence when reporting the annotated plasmid. Please note that information requested on gene sequences, gene annotation and gene/plasmid map, received on November 16, 2020, as well as analytical techniques used by the manufacturer, are proprietary to Pfizer-BioNTech. However, Health Canada’s scientists reviewed this, and all of the other submitted information, and considered it within the risk assessment for their product. Any residual DNA fragments are considered as inactive, and an internal assessment of submissions by Pfizer-BioNTech found that they were consistently reported below the limit recommended by WHO.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512609">Lastly, the lipid nanoparticle, LNP, component of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine preparation served as a delivery vehicle for the mRNA. Cells cannot efficiently internalize the mRNA in the absence of the LNP.</ParaText>

Terms and conditions were imposed upon the authorization with respect to quality, clinical, labelling, and risk management plan requirements. This process has allowed Health Canada to assess information submitted by the manufacturer as it became available during the product life cycle to ensure that the benefits of the vaccines continued to outweigh the risks. Additional safety and effectiveness data generated post-approval continue to support Health Canada's original decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512629">Mr. Speaker, as part of its domestic and international greenhouse gas reporting requirements, Canada must prepare and publish emissions projections on an annual basis. AAFC works with Environment and Climate Change Canada to develop the emissions projections for the agriculture sector, which includes the projected impact of any new, current, or planned programming. Through the agricultural climate solutions – on-farm climate action fund, the sustainable Canadian agricultural partnership, and the $34.1 million proposed in budget 2023 to support the adoption of nitrogen management practices, AAFC has most recently estimated a 1.44 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, Mt CO2e, reduction in fertilizer emissions per year by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512630">Although the 1.44 Mt CO2e estimate does not currently account for the projected impact of the agricultural climate solutions – living labs and agricultural clean technology program, both programs support the research, development, and adoption of practices and technologies that can reduce fertilizer emissions. In addition, some federally funded programs under the sustainable Canadian agricultural partnership, such as AgriScience and AgriInnovate, can support fertilizer-related projects along the innovation continuum. Because Canada’s emissions projections are updated annually, the estimated reduction in fertilizer emissions from all of AAFC’s current programming may be included as more research and data become available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512631">The 1.44 Mt CO2e estimate also does not account for industry-led or provincially led initiatives that may directly or indirectly reduce fertilizer emissions, including Fertilizer Canada’s 4R designation and certification, Farm Credit Canada’s 4R sustainability incentive program, and the Government of Ontario’s fertilizer accelerating solutions &amp; technology challenge. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512640">Mr. Speaker, in response to part (a), figure 5.1 reports emissions from the national inventory report of greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada. Cropland emissions are determined using an internationally accepted method, which has been modified to reflect Canadian soils, climate, crops and management practices. It is further adapted based on empirical data collected from research studies across Canada. Included in the emissions from cropland are direct and indirect nitrous oxide from synthetic fertilizers, organic fertilizers, crop residue decomposition, cultivation of organic soils, mineralization of soil organic carbon, conservation tillage, irrigation and manure on pasture and rangeland. Additionally, the method estimates nitrous oxide and methane emissions from field burning of agricultural residues as well as carbon dioxide emissions from liming and urea fertilizer application.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512651">Within Bill S-14, there are planned expansions for seven national parks and one national park reserve and the creation of two new national parks. Much of this land is already under the control and administration of Parks Canada, and in some cases for over 20 years. As such, the consultation and engagement has been varied and dependent upon the circumstances, has been supported by local ongoing working relationships and has occurred over an extended period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512652">Specifically, regarding the creation of new protected areas, Parks Canada begins consultation and engagement with provincial and territorial governments and indigenous governments and organizations at the feasibility stage where a potential protected area site is initially selected. This consultation and engagement is critical and carries on throughout the establishment process. Consultation processes with partners, key stakeholders, provincial and territorial governments, indigenous peoples, and representatives of communities located in or near the national parks and national marine conservation areas occurred in many communities and took many forms. This includes face-to-face meetings, correspondence, community newsletters, public open houses, community participation in the development of park management plans, and other fora.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512653">Canada has a legal duty to consult and accommodate, where appropriate, when it contemplates a project that may adversely impact upon the section 35 rights of indigenous peoples and takes these responsibilities very seriously. In fact, in a number of cases, protected areas that will be established or expanded within modern treaty areas are a requirement of land claim agreements or other agreements with modern treaty and self-government partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512654">Concerning the detailed aspects of the question, Parks Canada undertook an assessment to determine the amount of information that would fall within the scope of the question. The information requested is not systematically tracked in a centralized database. In some cases, Parks Canada has had administration and control of the lands for 20years or more and the lands have been managed as though they were part of the park during this period and consultation and engagement has occurred via formal and informal means throughout the time period. Parks Canada has concluded that producing and validating a comprehensive response to the question would require a manual collection of information that is not possible in the time allotted and could lead to the disclosure of incomplete and misleading information.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512658">Health Canada is aware of concerns surrounding SV40. In July 2023, through clarification requests, Health Canada evaluated the presence of the SV40 promoter-enhancer sequence in the plasmid used to prepare the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, COMIRNATY, as well as in residual DNA as a manufacturing impurity in the final vaccine product. Clarification requests are routinely issued during submission review to seek clarifications on various aspects of the file. Health Canada submitted a clarification request to Pfizer seeking additional information related to the SV40 sequences. Pfizer provided a reply to address all of Health Canada’s questions. Please note that communications between Health Canada and manufacturers related to the manufacturing and control of a vaccine are considered confidential business information that cannot be disclosed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512669">In response to part (b), at an aggregate level, the performance reports provided information confirming that the clean technologies were being adopted as planned and are achieving the projects’ anticipated greenhouse gases emissions reduction results. In addition, the reports provide information on efficiencies gained and results achieved at a granular level. They also detail a number of challenges and unforeseen circumstances that affected the adoption and use of these technologies. For example, supply chain issues, labour shortages, and other COVID-related challenges contributed to delays in adoption for some producers. Furthermore, unforeseen circumstances such as unseasonably wet or dry conditions were also noted in a number of performance reports. This led to some results falling short of targets, and some exceeding them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512673">Mr. Speaker, Health Canada’s mandate is to help Canadians maintain and improve their health. The health and safety of Canadians is Health Canada’s top priority, and the department exercises stringent regulatory oversight over health products, including vaccines. Health Canada received Pfizer’s submission seeking authorization to its Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on October 9, 2020, available at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2020/12/health-canada-authorizes-first-covid-19-vaccine0.html. The department is not a signing authority of purchasing contracts for health products, including COVID-19 vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512674">Before a vaccine is approved in Canada, the Department conducts a rigorous scientific review of its safety, efficacy and quality. Submissions typically contain extensive data regarding the vaccine's safety, efficacy and quality, including results of pre-clinical and clinical studies, details on manufacturing processes, and information on adverse events following immunization, or AEFI. An authorization is only issued when benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of its use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512675">Following authorization, Canada has a robust and well-established vaccine safety surveillance system involving Health Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, provinces and territories, and vaccine manufacturers. Health Canada continues to monitor the safety profile of health products once they are on the Canadian market, to help ensure that the benefits of the product continue to outweigh the risks. The safety profile of these products is monitored by reviewing safety information submitted by manufacturers as well as considering safety information from international regulators. When new safety issues are confirmed by the Department, Health Canada takes action, which may include communicating new risks to Canadians and healthcare professionals or changing the recommended use of the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512676">In response to (a) to (e), Health Canada is aware of the referred presentation regarding FDA “Plans for Monitoring COVID-19 Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness”, which occurred at the Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, held on October 22, 2020, including the slide #16 of the 22 “possible adverse event outcomes.” Since the authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccines in Canada on December 9, 2020, Health Canada has been monitoring possible adverse events including these 22 “possible adverse event outcomes.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512677">In addition, Health Canada and the PHAC have been actively monitoring and reviewing AEFI reports. All AEFI reports submitted by provincial and territorial public health authorities and federal departments are captured in the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System, or CAEFISS, which is managed by PHAC. In addition, the Canada Vigilance Program, or CVP, managed by Health Canada, receives AEFI reports from manufacturers, Canadian hospitals, healthcare professionals and consumers. Information about AEFIs reported in Canada, including some of the 22 “possible adverse event outcomes” is published on the Government of Canada’s website. It is important to note that these reports do not necessarily imply that a relationship between the adverse event and the vaccine has been established. However, they are an important information source supporting ongoing safety monitoring. Additional information is also available on the following public websites: COVID-19 Vaccine safety and side effects, at https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vaccines/safety-side-effects.html#a5; Vaccine safety and possible side effects, at https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/vaccination-children/safety-concerns-side-effects.html; Health Product InfoWatch, at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada/health-product-infowatch/published-newsletters.html#a1; Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 Vaccine, at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html; and Regulatory Decision Summary of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 Vaccine, at https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/info/regulatory-decision-summary-detailTwo.html?linkID=RDS00730.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512678">In response to (f) to (i), as part of the regulatory requirements, a product monograph is publicly released at the time of a vaccine’s authorization. The product monograph is developed and managed by the manufacturer. The content, wordings, and format are carefully reviewed by Health Canada to ensure that it is prepared in accordance with the Product monograph guidance documents and notices, found at Canada.ca. Updates of the product monograph are summarized in the Post-Authorization Activity Table (PAAT) at https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/info/paat-SBD00510-comirnaty-en.html for Comirnaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512679">A product monograph is a factual, scientific document on the drug product that, devoid of promotional material, describes the properties, claims, indications, and conditions of use for the drug, and that contains any other information that may be required for optimal, safe, and effective use of the drug. It is used to inform physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, other healthcare professionals, and patients about the appropriate use of the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512680">A package insert is also required at the time of a vaccine’s authorization. As noted above for the Canadian Product Monograph, at the time of authorization, the safety information included in package inserts was based on the available safety data from clinical trials. Furthermore, Health Canada is responsible for ensuring that the product monograph and package inserts are updated over time to adequately reflect the risks associated with the vaccines that are authorized in Canada. Health Canada-approved information is used by the appropriate bodies (e.g., provincial and local public health authorities, etc.) to guide recommendations, vaccine use, as well as information provided to vaccine recipients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512681">In response to (j) to (k), the referred report of 1,291 "serious adverse events (SAEs) of special interest" which were contained in Pfizer's report of April 30, 2021, entitled "5.3.6 CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS OF POST-AUTHORIZATION ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS OF PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) RECEIVED THROUGH 28-FEB-2021", was prepared by the manufacturer, Pfizer, for the US FDA. Health Canada reviewed safety reports submitted by the manufacturer including data from the referred report. The information reviewed did not identify new safety concerns and was consistent with the known safety profile of COMIRNATY. Outcomes of Health Canada’s safety reviews for COMIRNATY, as well as subsequent reviews, are available online at the Post Authorization Activity Table for COMIRNATY at https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/info/post-authorization-activity-table.html?linkID=SBD00510.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512687">Building on the existing robust pharmacovigilance system, Health Canada introduced strategies to enhance regulatory surveillance measures for COVID-19 vaccines. For example, terms and conditions in the document “Guidance for market authorization requirements for COVID-19 vaccines”, found at canada.ca, have been imposed on manufacturers to quickly request and gather critical safety and effectiveness information in order to mitigate risks during the product lifecycle. These enhanced regulatory surveillance measures enabled Health Canada to request additional risk monitoring activities and post-market studies, namely post-authorization studies on safety and effectiveness. These measures also provided tools for Health Canada to detect and evaluate emerging safety information on the benefit-risk balance of COVID-19 vaccines.

Manufacturers are required to report serious adverse events to Health Canada as the national regulatory authority, as well as submit regular summaries of global safety information. AEFI reports are monitored continuously by PHAC and Health Canada. Any new or unusual adverse events, or changes in trends or severity of specific events would trigger an investigation, including an in-depth medical review and risk assessment.

The department exercises stringent regulatory oversight over vaccines, and conducts a rigorous scientific review of their safety, efficacy and quality prior to authorization. In July 2023, Health Canada evaluated the presence of the SV40 promoter/enhancer sequence in the plasmid used to prepare the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, or COMIRNATY, as well as in residual DNA as a manufacturing impurity in the final vaccine product. Clarification requests are routinely issued during submission review to seek clarifications on various aspects of the file. Health Canada submitted a clarification request to Pfizer seeking additional information related to the SV40 sequences. Pfizer provided a reply to address all of Health Canada’s questions. Please note that communications between Health Canada and manufacturers related to the manufacturing and control of a vaccine are considered confidential business information that cannot be disclosed.</ParaText>

In addition, all COMIRNATY commercial vaccine batches, released in Canada, complied with the quality requirements approved by Health Canada, including the requirements for residual DNA. An Issue Analysis Summary, or IAS, was initially considered to document the process but was later deemed to be unnecessary as the residual DNA content in the final product was consistently below the limit of 10 nanograms per human dose, which is in line with the World Health Organization’s recommendation concerning residual DNA in biological drugs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512697">Mr. Speaker, the Pan-Canadian Vaccine Injury Support Program, or VISP, provides financial support to people in Canada in the rare event that they experience a serious and permanent injury as a result of receiving a Health Canada authorized vaccine, administered in Canada, on or after December 8, 2020. The program also provides death benefits and support for funeral expenses in the rare case of a death as a result of receiving a Health Canada authorized vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512698">The Pan-Canadian VISP was launched on June 1, 2021, and is being administered independently by OXARO, formerly known as Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Consulting Inc., with funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC. This program is available for people who were vaccinated in all provinces except Quebec. PHAC is not involved in individual cases, including in the determination of decisions regarding causality or compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512699">As the independent administrator, OXARO operates at arm’s length from PHAC and oversees all aspects of claims intake and assessment. OXARO is responsible for providing periodic public reporting on program statistics. Public reporting began on December 1, 2021, and data on the pan-Canadian VISP is updated twice a year. Latest public reporting can be found at https://vaccineinjurysupport.ca/en/program-statistics. The latest reporting shows the program statistics as of December 1, 2023. The next update will be available in June 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512700">The province of Quebec continues to administer its longstanding Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, or VICP, for people vaccinated in that province, with federal funding. Information on Quebec’s VICP, including program statistics as of March 31, 2023, can be found at https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/advice-and-prevention/vaccination/vaccine-injury-compensation-program#c3895.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512701">In response to questions (a), (b), (e), (f), and (k), as of OXARO’s last public report on December 1, 2023, OXARO had received 2233 claims; approved 138 claims by Medical Review Board; received 102 claims of appeals; approved 6 appeals; and paid $11.236 million in financial support to eligible claimants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512702">As of Quebec’s last public report on March 1, 2023, since 1988, Quebec had received 410 claims; approved 56 claims; received 92 claims of appeals; approved 9 appeals; and paid $9.397 million in financial support to eligible claimants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512703">These program statistics, including the claims received, claims approved and appeals, can also be found on the OXARO website.

As a result, PHAC does not request nor receive any information regarding individual claims received by OXARO nor data related to demographics, types of vaccines, or the nature of vaccine injuries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512705">In response to questions (l), (m) and (n),with regards to the physicians conducting the medical board reviews and assessment process followed, OXARO has advised PHAC that they ensure the medical experts hold both a valid license with their respective College of Physicians and a valid Canadian Medical Protective Association membership across Canada. Depending on the nature of the injury, the team of medical experts assembled to review a claim can include specialists, such as cardiologists and neurologists. This is done to provide a comprehensive analysis of each claim. Medical review boards use a causality assessment process developed by OXARO that is based on accepted industry practices and the World Health Organization’s guidance on the causality assessment of an adverse event following immunization.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512710">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has committed to cap and reduce greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from the oil and gas sector at a pace and scale necessary to contribute to Canada’s 2030 climate goals, to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, and in a way that allows the sector to compete in the emerging net-zero global economy. As the country’s largest source of GHG emissions and the only major source that continues to grow, decarbonizing the oil and gas sector is critical to achieving Canada’s emission targets. The sector is also an economic powerhouse, proven innovator, and source of good jobs. The emissions cap will help decarbonize oil and gas production to make Canada a highly efficient producer supplying global demand and ensure the sector is on a path to net-zero by 2050. The emissions cap is an integral piece of the Government of Canada’s roadmap to support the decarbonization of oil and gas production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512711">On July 18, 2022, the government published a discussion paper outlining two regulatory options to cap GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector: a new national GHG emissions cap-and-trade system, and modifications to existing carbon pricing systems. The discussion document sought feedback on the two options, and generated a significant response. Environment and Climate Change Canada, or ECCC, received over 150 submissions from provinces and territories, indigenous organizations, industry, environmental non-governmental organizations, and academics, as well as over 25,000 comments from members of the public. Feedback on the discussion paper has informed the government’s approach on this important policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512712">In addition to the formal comment period, the Government of Canada has held a significant number of information webinars and bilateral meetings with various partners and interested parties. Information gathered and feedback received during this engagement has been taken into consideration in the design of the proposed regulatory approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512713">On December 7, 2023, the Government of Canada published a regulatory framework to cap and cut emissions in the oil and gas sector for a 60-day public comment period. The government received 107 formal written submissions from provinces and territories, indigenous organizations, industry, environmental non-governmental organizations, and academics, as well as over 35,000 comments from members of the public. Feedback on the regulatory framework is being used to inform the development of proposed regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512714">The Government of Canada plans to publish proposed regulations in 2024 in Part I of the Canada Gazette for a 60-day public comment period. The impacts of the policy will be assessed as part of the regulatory process and published in the regulatory impacts analysis statement that accompanies the proposed regulations. Formal written comments will also be sought on the proposal at that time. Publication of the final regulations is targeted for 2025, with the first reporting obligations starting as early as 2026 and full system requirements phased in between 2026 and 2030.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512760">Mr. Speaker, with regard to the investment of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, or CIB, in the Avenue Living residential retrofits, with regard to (a), the CIB’s investment is structured as two corporate loans, together the “CIB credit facility”, to two Avenue Living entities, together, “Avenue Living”, that wholly own the properties being considered for decarbonization retrofits, each a “project”. Drawdowns under the CIB credit facility are made available to Avenue Living pursuant to a four-year availability period up to a maximum amount of 80% of total eligible project costs net of grants, not to exceed $130 million in aggregate. The aggregate amount drawn will convert to a fully amortizing term loan which at the earliest of the completion of the final project; or one year following the end of the availability period. The CIB’s investment must be fully repaid within 24 years of financial close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512761">With regard to (b), Avenue Living has not used the CIB credit facility to finance retrofits of any properties as of May 3, 2024. Avenue Living has identified a preliminary list of approximately 95 properties that it intends to retrofit with CIB financing. The proposed portfolio consists of approximately 240 buildings, all of which are bound by specific eligibility criteria, including a required minimum decarbonization threshold. In accordance with the provisions of the CIB credit facility, Avenue Living can add, remove or replace properties in the preliminary list throughout the availability period, subject to meeting the defined eligibility criteria and satisfying the minimum decarbonization threshold, always subject to the term of the availability period and the maximum aggregate CIB investment amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512762">With regard to (c), the CIB is not privy to any information related to specific properties and rent increases.  Furthermore, Avenue Living has not used the CIB credit facility to finance retrofits of any properties as of May 3, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512763">With regard to (d), no disbursements under the CIB credit facility have been made to Avenue Living as of May 3, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512764">With regard to (e), all projects are at various stages of early development as of May 3, 2024, with certain properties further along and nearing eligibility criteria and conditions for disbursements under the CIB credit facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512765">With regard to (f), the core mandate of the CIB’s Building Retrofits Initiative, or BRI, is to reduce investment barriers to modernize and improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings to drive significant reduction in carbon emissions, which additionally will improve the living conditions for tenants through co-benefits. In the case of Avenue Living, each project is subject to meeting specific minimum decarbonization targets and the potential CIB investment was assessed on that basis. The CIB credit facility was agreed on terms that made those reductions economically feasible. Also, Avenue Living is bound under the CIB credit facility by requirements to comply with applicable law, including any applicable landlord-tenant laws, regulations and policies in effect at the time in the relevant jurisdictions. The goal for Avenue Living is to achieve a greenhouse gas, or GHG, remissions reduction of over 49% across the portfolio of retrofitted projects, while maintaining a required minimum annual GHG reduction threshold of at least 30% for each building.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512766">With regard to (g), while an indirect benefit of the CIB credit facility is to lower the economic burden on Avenue Living and its tenants that benefit from retrofits, the core mandate of the CIB’s BRI is to support existing property owners in reducing investment barriers to modernize and improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings, which dictates the specific provisions included in any given credit agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512767">With regard to (h), CIB understands that affordability is a critical issue for Canadians, which is why going forward we are ensuring residential building upgrades financed by CIB will not be used as a rationale to increase rent. Avenue Living and the CIB continue to discuss this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512768">With regard to (i), for all subsequent CIB investments under the BRI that finance retrofitting of multi-unit residential buildings, the loan agreements will include provisions that limit a borrower’s ability to increase rents or impose additional utility burdens on existing tenants as a result of the CIB’s investment in the decarbonization retrofits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8512770">Mr. Speaker, with respect to my colleague’s question, what follows is the response from the Canada Revenue Agency, or CRA, as of May 3, 2024, that is, the date of question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512771">With regard to (a) and (b), the CRA does not collect information on the nationality of a registered charity’s agents or intermediaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512772">With regard to (c), in order to be registered as a charity, an organization must be constituted exclusively for charitable purposes and devote all of its resources to activities that further those purposes. Charitable purposes fall into one or more of the following categories: the relief of poverty; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion; and other purposes beneficial to the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512773">The Income Tax Act allows a registered charity to operate in the following ways: carrying on its own charitable activities through its staff and volunteers; or an intermediary, where a charity must exercise direction and control over its own resources; making qualifying disbursements through gifts to qualified donees; or grants to grantees, or non-qualified donees, where a charity must meet accountability requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512774">A registered charity’s purposes must also provide a tangible benefit to the public as a whole, or a significant section of it. In addition, purposes and activities that are illegal in Canada or contrary to Canadian public policy are prohibited, including support for terrorist and military activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512775">Also, registered charities must keep adequate books and records to allow the CRA to verify donations made to the charity, to ensure the proper use of charitable resources, and that the charity's purposes and activities continue to be charitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512776">As is always the case, in order to determine if a particular activity furthers a charitable purpose and meets all other registration requirements under the Income Tax Act, the CRA would need to consider all the relevant facts on a case-by-case basis. If the CRA identifies non-compliance as a result of an audit, it uses a risk-based approach where possible. By taking this approach, the CRA generally gives a charity the opportunity to correct non-compliance through education or a compliance agreement; while other interventions, such as sanctions or revocations, are reserved for cases where a charity has engaged in more serious acts of non-compliance. The facts of the charity’s case will determine which compliance approach the CRA will take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512777">The CRA makes its decisions around the audit of registered charities involved with “domestic and international recipients” based on the Income Tax Act and common law requirements for registered charities. The application of these requirements is applied regardless of the country in which a charity may operate, and/or the nationality of any agents and intermediaries they may choose to engage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8512778">With regard to (d), sensitive information about the CRA’s internal processes, such as its risk assessment strategies, audit techniques, and file selection reasons, as well as any other information that a member of the public would otherwise be ineligible from accessing, cannot be disclosed. Given that this type of information could be used to undermine and potentially jeopardize the CRA's compliance efforts, the CRA does not disclose that type of information to external parties under any circumstance, even where authorization on specific taxpayer files is obtained.</ParaText>

The most recent ITB Annual Report, in 2023, highlights, at a national level, the impact of ITB obligations active in 2022, which presents a point in time snapshot using the latest available data. The report provides information on obligations over the 15-year time period from 2017 to 2033. This timeframe is used for the annual report to reflect the achievement period of ITB obligations by prime contractors, which can last a number of years. The report was updated in fall 2023 and is published annually to provide information on leveraging current and planned military procurements. The 2022 Annual Report presents data beginning 2016; the 2021 Annual Report presents data beginning 2015.</ParaText>

As an example, the ITB business activity in Quebec over the reporting period is focused on aerospace, 68%, followed by information technology and land-based something, 20%, marine, 8%, space, 2% and other industries, 2%. For the purposes of reporting and given the need to aggregate data values, projects in the territories are captured under Western Canada.</ParaText>

Page 4 provides information on the annual average economic impact of the ITB Policy based on ITB transactions credited over the 2017-2021 period from ITB obligations active in 2022. Economic impact estimates are reported at the national level and cannot be broken down at the regional level; economic impact methodologies principles are presented on page 12.</ParaText>
