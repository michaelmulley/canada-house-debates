            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8794864"> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to see you today taking the chair as we begin our proceedings. I think back to the fond memories I have over the past few years. I think, like all of us, I kind of divide my life into the pre-COVID and post-COVID world. The very first time I was able to be away from home as restrictions were gradually being lifted during the immediate aftermath of the COVID lockdowns was when I took a trip to Nova Scotia and spent time in your beautiful constituency. It is really one of the most beautiful places anywhere in the world, and certainly in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794865">I know that all MPs, if asked, would insist that their riding is the most beautiful in Canada. I would submit that some have a better case than others, but in the same way that every mother truly believes that her baby is the most beautiful ever born, we all have this view of our constituency. However, when we are looking at other constituencies, we can have a more jaundiced eye, and I can say that even the most jaundiced eye would find the beautiful Fundy shore of Nova Scotia to be a place of extraordinary natural cultural beauty and richness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794866"> I am here to join a debate that has now been going on in the House for some time. There have been a series of amendments before the House, subamendments to an amendment to a motion that was made some time ago, and I thought it might be helpful, given how much time has passed, to refresh the memory of the House as to the wording of the amendment. I do this each time I speak to a subamendment, and I thought this morning I would do so in the other official language.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794889">This means, of course, that all of the current proceedings could be suspended if the original House order given in June, to which the main motion refers, were complied with. The government could immediately bring to an end all of it, including the process that would tie up the procedure and House affairs committee for some time, if the government were to instruct its departments to provide the documents in unredacted form. I think it is a very sensible, reasonable subamendment to have made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794890">I said I would return to:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="3" IndentRest="3">(iii), the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, who respected the order of the House and deposited unredacted documents.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794892">I wanted to return to it to make the point that it is possible to fully comply. Full compliance was achieved by a government agency. It is interesting to note that the agency that did comply is in fact the agency whose responsibility it is to protect privacy rights: the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, who, as one can imagine, is punctilious in having an official regard for the importance of keeping matters private.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794893"> We have heard, endlessly and volubly, from the few members of the Liberal Party who are allowed to speak on the matter or on any other topic about the ostensibly enormous procedural justice problems that would arise if the documents were submitted, as the House ordered, to the Clerk and the legal counsel. These arguments are, of course, nonsense. I will just restate what is wrong with the arguments: The documents would be submitted not to the view of the general public but to a law clerk who would have the ability to sift through and make sure that nothing is disclosed in a way that would compromise an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794894"> However, we should be clear about this; material is presented all the time to the police that has to be discounted at the time of an investigation if it was improperly acquired. The ways in which evidence is improperly acquired are not likely to conform very closely to the situation we have here. For example, if the police raid someone's house with a warrant in which they are looking for a certain offence, they cannot then go on a fishing expedition and look for other offences while they are in there under the auspices of that warrant. The court issued a warrant that gives them a very limited purview.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794895">If the police entered the house looking for evidence that it is an illegal drug production facility, and while they are there they find some evidence of some greater crime, such as evidence that a murder has taken place, they can use that, but that is different. If they go in looking for the evidence of that drug facility and they find other things, relating to unpaid parking tickets for example, they cannot use that material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794896">We should be very careful of the procedural arguments being made by the government, and consider them as being inherently suspect. I should note that in general we should be very suspicious of the respect or the lack of respect for procedural justice, for the law, for the rule of law, indeed, for the rule of anything other than the absolute will of the sitting <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that is displayed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794897">It is the same government that imposed the Emergencies Act, effectively a kind of martial law, in order to suppress a peaceful demonstration that was happening outside this place. The government demonized the individuals involved in it, who were in fact mostly just hard-working citizens who were put in an impossible position by the government's ruthless and unfair actions towards them. It is a government that attempted, under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to suspend the entire workings of responsible government for a year and a half.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8794898"> I can remember coming here in late March 2020, shortly after COVID had been declared a pandemic. We were all in a personal panic, I guess, but we were all told to stay home. Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “Go home and stay home.” I can still remember him standing at Rideau Cottage, which is misnamed, by the way. Rideau Cottage, which can be looked up on Wikipedia, where it has its own article, is actually a mansion on the grounds of a 20-acre estate, the grounds of Rideau Hall. The Prime Minister spoke from the front steps of his mansion on his 20-acre estate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794899">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a man who, when he got bored of that place, could always take off and go to Harrington Lake, breaking a series of provincial protocols about crossing borders at that time, to stay at Harrington Lake where he has a beautiful farmhouse. I have been there under a previous prime minister; it is gorgeous. It is a private lake up in the mountains. It is spectacular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794900">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could go from one place to the other. However, he was saying to people who live in a bachelor apartment with no balcony and maybe facing into a light well in the apartment building so they get no natural light, “Go home and stay home”, as if somehow he were their moral superior.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794901"> This has been, of course, the theme of the current government: endless virtue signalling about its own moral superiority. At the same time, it is engaging in the most vile practices, such as squandering the country's money and the inheritance of our children; driving up the price of housing to unaffordable levels; and creating a greater disparity of wealth than we have ever seen before, which is getting worse at an increasing pace as the Liberals adopt policy after policy designed to take from the tax base as a whole to transfer to the people who happen to be in positions to take advantage of the various things they are offering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794902"> Almost every service now that has been created under the current government is effectively something that benefits primarily the people who are already well off. A great example is the $10-a-day child care, which is completely unavailable in a rural riding like mine and to anybody who works shift work, who works at night, who lives in a rural area or who lacks the transportation to get their child to the day care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794903">The child care program basically eliminates the entire working class. It eliminated a lot of people during COVID. I understand their going in to work despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s injunction for us to stay home, which I regarded as insulting and also as an order that cannot be enforced on members of Parliament, who have a right to come to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794904"> When I came in, I used to take the O-Train. My wife and I have a place in the west end. The people who were coming in to work during COVID were all the working-class people who did not get a chance to stay home when we were told that coming to work put our life in danger, including the people whom we said were heroes, until later on, during the period of the convoy, the Liberals decided they were zeroes. Those were the people who were on the train; it was very interesting to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794905">The mix of people on the train changed in that period. It became a lot less white and a lot more brown because, whether the government wants to say it or not, increasingly with the Liberals' immigration policies there is a clear racial divide. On the one side are people who have the better jobs, the privileged jobs and the jobs that give us access to, among other things, the reliable hours that allow one to take advantage of $10-a-day day care and that also give us higher salaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794906">On the other side are the people who do not have that option, who had to keep on working during COVID and who are excluded from programs like $10-a-day day care. Is there some kind of compensation for these people, whereby if they cannot get it, they will get some kind of benefit? No, of course there is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794907"> Let us look at the carbon tax. The same thing is going on. The carbon tax is designed for the purpose of changing incentives. It is overtly designed for the purpose of re-incentivizing, of making it more painful and expensive to use carbon. What do we mean by carbon? We mean gas or diesel, home heating fuel and the burning of fossil fuels. Well, people who live in a rural area and who drive an older vehicle may not be able to afford to replace it with one of the fabulous new Cybertrucks, one of which I just saw on Parliament Hill for the first time ever in real life yesterday. They look as cool in real life, and as futuristic, as they do in the pictures.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8794908">Anyway, I guarantee that truck was not driven by a resident of my riding. I guarantee they cannot afford Cybertrucks or other electric vehicles, and even if they could, the reality is I cannot afford these things. I am paid an MP salary. I looked into getting a purely electric vehicle. I have a hybrid Toyota Highlander. I looked into whether it is possible to get an electric SUV, and the answer is that I cannot. They do not have long enough range to be workable in rural areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794909">As such, we created an incentive that punishes people for having gas-burning vehicles, and we punish people who cannot switch because of the nature of where they live. I guess they could sell and come to the city and say that they just give up on living out there. My riding and all ridings in rural Ontario, and Nova Scotia, for that matter, are full of abandoned farms from over the decades as it ceased to be economically viable to live in one place or another, but of course, the people who left those farms, who had cleared the land or whose parents had cleared the land, have lost the value of that asset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794910">That is being increased by what the government is doing. They come to the city where housing prices and rents have doubled, meaning it is unaffordable. People in my constituency are poorer than the average. We are in the bottom quarter of the Ontario population, but there is a long-term pattern I have seen working here. I have been here a quarter of a century now. When I was first elected on November 27, 2000, there were only two ridings in the province of Ontario that were run by my party, the old Canadian Alliance, mine and that Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, directly to our north. Both are rural areas with lower than average incomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794911"> Within my old riding of Lanark—Carleton, we had an enormously wealthy area, Kanata, which had, among other things, a billionaire living there. I had the wealthiest suburb in Canada. At the far other end of my riding, I had the poorest municipality, the Lanark Highlands, in the entire province, outside of indigenous areas in northern Ontario. Interestingly enough, the results were that I did worst in the wealthiest areas and best in the poorest areas. The actual lowest-income spot in the entire riding was the only spot where I got more than 50% of the vote at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794912"> That is a pattern that has not disappeared. That pattern has replicated itself over and over again, not just in my riding, but across the country. The Liberals are the party of the privileged, the well off, by which I do not necessarily mean that billionaire I was referring to, who made his money in high tech. I am referring to those whose wealth and well-being is the result of what is properly understood as privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794913"> We hear a lot of nonsense about privilege. I remember one occasion when I was asking a minister a question about corrections. He rose up to say that the member was asking the question from a position of privilege. I literally have no idea what that sociological academic babble even means, but real privilege is a right that is issued as a licence. It is a licenced right. A driver's licence is a privilege. I cannot just hop in a car and drive. It is not an absolute right. One has to fulfill certain things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794914">More and more activities are effectively privileged in this society, and privileged to the same people over and over again. The rules are adjusted as necessary to ensure that those people, their friends and their relatives stay at the top, whether it is through adjusting the zoning laws, the housing regulations or the building costs so that, effectively, the housing supply is shrunk, making one group of people, and I am fortunate to be in that group of people who are older and own homes, wealthier at the expense of those who do not, who happen to be younger, more recently arrived in Canada and, typically, browner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794915">If that seems like a picture of social justice to someone, then they have a very different conception of social justice than I do, but that is the government, and the government has been the opposite of transparent. We have been tied up trying to resolve the issue of getting the government to release documents revealing the depth of the scandal, and it has been willing to allow House business to be held up for over a month while we deal with this. That says a great deal about how much the Liberals are committed to having absolute opacity, a black box of government, under which they can carry on activities that I think do not meet the standards of any decent Canadian.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794935">Mr. Speaker, the member's intervention gives me the opportunity to make another point. I did talk about the election in 2000 when only two members of my party were elected in Ontario. That was an election where 98 out of 102 ridings in Ontario had members who were elected for the Liberal Party. The other riding was the one that the member currently holds, and it was Joe Comartin, who was a great member.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794939">However, related to this question of giving documents to the RCMP, to an outside third party, is the question of whether the legislative branch is getting too close to the law enforcement branch. That, in some ways, is the issue. To look at an analogy, let us say that, at some future date, there were a coalition of parties in the House that said, “We demand to have the tax records of certain individuals”, and that could be for whatever reasons. It could be spite or political retribution. It does not really matter. We know that presidents of the United States, in the past, even going as far back as former president Roosevelt, used the tax system to get to people. How would the member feel about Parliament asking for those kinds of documents so that they could be given to a third party, say the Canadian Taxpayers Federation? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794940">Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the hon. member for his kind words. Likewise, one of the highlights of my career was working on the parliamentary Special Committee on Electoral Reform, which this member chaired. He did an extraordinary job with what, I have to say, was a very difficult file. We do not often get the chance to say nice things about each other. I actually do think highly of most colleagues, both those who are presently here and those, like Joe Comartin, who have left. We have had many extraordinary people pass through, and I have been very fortunate to have been able to serve with so many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794941">However, the obvious thought here is that, in the example provided, with the purpose being that the documents were to be given to an external group, such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, I think that would be very unwise. What would happen here is that they would be given to the Parliamentary Law Clerk, who would then go through them and make independent judgments about them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794942">The purpose of doing that would not be merely to facilitate prosecution. In fact, I do not think that is the primary purpose at all. It would be to make sure that the potential for prosecution does not serve to hide the fact that there are other things going on, which may or may not be illegal, but that are outside of what Canadians expect to have with regard to the governance of their money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794943">We all understand that mere compliance with the law is insufficient in a government. It has to go beyond and try to match up with the various other rules and codes, such as the ethics code, which we have to sign on to, and the conflict of interest code, for which office holders have a separate code that is more restrictive. There are also other rules and norms in place, the very conventions that we have here, that are only partly written down. The practices are themselves norms that are not enforceable by law. They are enforceable by public opinion. Depriving the public of the ability to see relevant documentation is the concern that I have here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794947"> Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the opportunity to stand and speak to some of the ways the Liberal government is wasting taxpayers' money. One such instance is the green slush fund. Although we are debating the subamendment to the amendment today, I will quickly give a bit of history. I will talk about how we got here, where the Liberals went and continue to go wrong and how they are misspending taxpayer dollars in abuses that we continue to see and hear about in the media daily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794948">However, before I do, I would like to remind everyone back home that there are a number of Santa Claus parades this weekend that I will be attending. I like to promote that they are happening. Tonight, in beautiful Little Britain, Ontario, there is a Santa Claus parade. There are three of them tomorrow, one around the noon hour in Millbrook, Ontario, then in Bobcaygeon in the later part of the afternoon and early evening and then in Sunderland, Ontario, with the third one of the weekend. If anyone is watching in the TV world or listening to this, and they are in those areas and want to take in beautiful Santa Claus parades, there are spectacular ones happening at night. They will not leave disappointed, I guarantee that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794949">As I mentioned, we are talking here about some rather unfortunate news that continues to happen. It is the continued disregard of a House order to produce documents, and the Liberals have had no qualms about paralyzing Parliament for a few months as we continue to wait for the government to accept and adhere to that order. I should remind the government that it was the democratically elected House of Commons that voted for the documents to be produced in the green slush fund scandal. I want to thank members of the industry committee, in particular, the member sitting next to me from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, who was one of the members leading the charge on exposing the scandal. He stayed up late at night in his office, going through countless documents to piece everything together and make the puzzle come together. That was thanks to his work, but, unfortunately, this whole thing is an absolute disaster for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794950">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> and I did a podcast on that, which is on my website and the member's website. In it, we go over the various steps in terms of how much corruption happened and how people appointed to this board to oversee this fund started to apply for contracts with companies in their names. However, they would kind of stand, wink-wink, nudge-nudge, either at the back of the room or outside the room while decisions for funding were being made. They would come back into the room when that was done, and the next person would leave. They would vote on money going to their companies. Holy smokes, it sounds unbelievable just to say this, does it not? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794951">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> knew about it; he became aware when people in his office said there might be a bit of a problem. Of course, in typical Liberal fashion, he thought, what does that matter? It is only taxpayer dollars, so why bother being accountable for that kind of thing? It is unbelievable; it really is. The fund had good intentions, but we can leave it to the Liberals to make a mess of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794952">I think that is the core of discussions happening among Canadians and around kitchen tables, about how fragile the economy is right now and how the anchors of our economy, such as oil and gas, mining and lumber, have taken a massive hit. These are the traditional anchors of our economy; they produce jobs, opportunity, wealth and tax revenue to allow the government to spend on various social programs. I believe all Canadians appreciate how massively those industries have taken a hit. We have seen billions of dollars in investment leave this country to go to other markets. The United States is one country of many to which we have seen this flight happen, and many predictions are that this will accelerate over the coming months because of the policies put into effect by the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8794953"> Most certainly, it goes around certainty within industry. As water does, capital takes the path of least resistance. Right now, there is very little certainty in the anchors of our economy in terms of starting and completing a project. There are many hurdles; in some of the fastest-growing industries, the fastest job creator in our economy is government. When the government bloats the middle and the top, things slow down. I am not talking about the service delivery people, who are doing amazing work. We all know that business likes to move fast, because trends can also take a turn very quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794954">Some people have heard that government needs to move at the speed of business, and that is the furthest thing from the truth of what is happening. It is rather unfortunate, because we now have a government that focuses on the management of the economy through grant programs, subsidies and new programs. Conservatives would say that we should level the playing field, make it a competitive environment and allow the market to take hold and make decisions. It is very tough for the government to really focus in and try to create a program that is good for everyone. There are tweaks and there are people who get left out. We often hear in our ridings about people not qualifying for certain programs or hurdles they have to get over in order to access the program. Some hurdles are too much for them, and they do not qualify; this creates problems in their life. If we can level the playing field, create a competitive environment and allow the market to take hold, those little nuances in the economy start to get filled in by the marketplace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794955">We can look at how uncompetitive we are in Canada. We have a few big telecom providers, a few airlines and a few grocery store chains. Yes, there are smaller ones underneath them, but they are all owned by the same company. That is a massive problem when we are talking about competition. As we all know, competition means a better price, better service and better products. In a competitive environment, operations are always pushing for those targets. If they are failing to achieve those targets, new operations start up and start to fill in those gaps that have been created by the bigger ones getting sloppy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794956">However, when there are barriers to competition, those small cracks do not get filled in, so we do not actually get better products and better service at better prices. We see that in the sectors I mentioned earlier. It is much better for the individual to make choices based on their needs than to have a one-size-fits-all program. We have seen time and time again that this does not work for everybody. Everybody's life is different, and people need to be able to make their own decisions. Everybody should be able to make a choice based on their circumstance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794957">As I said earlier, the market will provide solutions. We can look at areas in which the government has little control in the marketplace. Let us take the beer industry, for example. Pretty much all of our ridings have a brewery in them, or even many. The Speaker's has a couple. This is an area that the government has not been regulating to the point of stifling the competition, as it has done in the telecom or the airline industry. There are different kinds of breweries everywhere. There are different kinds of beers being made for every single taste. Some might not be big sellers, but it is there if people want to try. If they like it, they are able to consume it. The point is this: When we allow the market to flourish, the market will provide. When people have more choices, when they are freer to make decisions, this generally makes for a happier population altogether. When we look at where the government clamps down the most, we will see the most unhappy people. This is something that we, as Conservatives, hold to be fundamentally true. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794958"> If the government were in charge of the music industry, and this started with Confederation, I pretty much guarantee that we would still be listening to chamber music. We would have some cellist union or something upset about this or that, and there would be a bureaucracy that would not be able to move. Meanwhile, there are many different genres of music right now for everybody's taste; this keeps developing over the years and months. We always have something new, and trends go up and down; this is because we have artists with the ability to make their music and their product. Some make hits and go on to make lots of money and some still play in their garage just for fun, and there is nothing wrong with any of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794959">It is all around less regulation and less red tape; this lets people who make those ideas flourish, creates a level playing field and lets the consumer decide. This is why we are talking about the accountability part and allowing that direction to take hold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794960">One issue I am having in my portfolio, as the critic for Crown-indigenous relations and indigenous services, is the issue around Jordan's principle. This is really starting to heat up now. Members might have seen the news the other day. APTN, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, published a series of reports about how badly the government is doing on Jordan's principle, which is about ensuring that children are funded for care needs. Before Jordan's principle, it was usually an issue of who pays. Through court cases and other methods, the federal government is responsible for youth. The Jordan's principle measure is meant to ensure that indigenous youth get the care they require immediately and that there is no question about the cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794961">According to APTN, there is a backlog about 144,000 files deep for applications to Jordan's principle. Those are usually people who are looking for certain health care costs to be covered. According to APTN, there is no deadline or path to clearing this backlog. As I just mentioned, it is a commitment to uphold the rights of indigenous children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794962">For those just joining, it is a principle named in honour of Jordan River Anderson, who was a young boy from Norway House Cree Nation. Jordan's principle was designed to ensure that first nations children receive the same access to public services as non-indigenous children, without delays or disruptions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794963">Our party's leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, has said that if a Conservative government is elected in the next federal election, we will fully fund Jordan's principle to ensure that no child, regardless of where they live or their heritage, would be denied or delayed essential services because of bureaucratic red tape. Again, the current government has failed to live up to this commitment. Some of these indigenous children face some of the most serious health and social challenges and continue to be denied the services they need to be able to thrive. Those services could be from health care, education, mental health services or basic needs such as mobility aids and medicine. These are the services promised by Jordan's principle; unfortunately, they are still being delayed or denied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794964">Unfortunately, as we approach the Christmas break, there are now reports surfacing about massive layoffs of educational assistants right across the country because of delays in Jordan's principle. Another one came out just this morning. This, of course, raises a number of concerns about whether the indigenous students affected will be able to return to class in January. We have talked many times in the House about the historical injustices that indigenous peoples, particularly children, have faced. Again, Jordan's principle was meant to correct all of that. Unfortunately, it has become yet another failure on the government's record.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8794965"> This is the failure of the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> to properly administer Jordan's principle. Unfortunately, we are seeing that inequality continue under the government and the harms it is creating for the most vulnerable, especially children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794966">It is not just a matter of dollars and cents; it is a question of moral responsibility. Canada has a duty to right the wrongs of the past, to ensure that every child, no matter where they come from or what community they belong to, can live a healthy and fulfilling life. We know that when children have access to the right services at the right time, they grow up happier and more successful. We know early intervention can change the trajectory of a child's life, preventing lifelong illnesses and struggles, and setting them on a path of success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794967">We, the opposition, are calling on the government to fulfill its responsibility, to fully implement Jordan's principle, to stand up for what Canada has a duty to provide, to ensure no indigenous child is denied access to the services they need. It is not just an indigenous issue; it is a Canadian issue. Every child in this country, I think we all agree, should be able to access the same opportunities, the same services, the same care, regardless of their background or where they live. Jordan's principle, as I said earlier, is a step toward making this a reality, but we need the government to do its part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794968">It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation> to act clearly to immediately ensure every indigenous child receives the care, support and services they need to succeed, or to step aside and let someone else do it. We on this side of the House are prepared to do that. We need to stand up for those children who have been left behind for far too long. Let us hold the government accountable. Let the House demand that it live up to the promises of Jordan's principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794969">These children are the future of our country and we cannot continue to fail them. The failure to properly administer Jordan's principle and the green slush fund scandal, as I mentioned right off the top, are more than isolated incidents. In a previous speech, I went through, one by one, the various scandals the government has managed to jump itself into, and the erosion of public trust in the government and in our institutions because of the actions the government has taken. When Canadians see their hard-earned dollars squandered on waste, fraud and abuse, they start to lose faith in the ability of their government to act in their best interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794970">The green slush fund raises concerns about the effectiveness of the Liberal approach: focusing more on political manoeuvring and less on actual, tangible solutions. Canadians' frustration with the government continues to grow. Time is running out for the government. Many people are calling for change, for an election. Many people want to see their country start to thrive again, to make products here at home, to create jobs, to create opportunity and wealth, all of which have been slowly fading away because of the policies of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794971">Hopefully, the government will see that it is time to put its ideas to the test and perhaps even implement some of our ideas. We have talked about how taking the tax off new homes could start to create that ability for first-time homebuyers to get into the home ownership market. We have talked about axing the tax, fixing the budget and stopping the crime. We hope to do that very soon, if given the opportunity by Canadians after the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8794972">I appreciate the opportunity and I look forward to the questions ahead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8794976">In terms of his question, I think, overall, competitiveness is lacking in this country. If we look at where investment is and where it is not, that becomes very clear. We continue to have more lumber mills in British Columbia start to close, and small towns being deeply affected by the mills closing. We have indigenous communities that have interests in lumber mills that are not able to move their product because of the competitiveness, the lack of a softwood lumber agreement. It goes on to oil and gas, to mining and so on. This country is just not as competitive. It is unfortunate, because we have the resources to do that.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, we see a situation that was started under Stephen Harper, the millions he spent against Jordan's principle. The spying he did against Cindy Blackstock, who was the champion of Jordan's principle, was carried on by the Liberals. What the Liberals have learned is that they cannot defy the courts. They can just let the system continue to do what it has always done, which is to deny rights by ignoring them. Children are continuing to die. The system is not broken, my friend; this is how it was built. It was built by the likes of Stephen Harper and it has been continued by the government, and first nations children continue to suffer.</ParaText>

I remind him that the inflation that has taken hold in Canada is baked into the prices we are seeing now. It is not as if prices are actually going down. The prices of groceries are still absolutely insane, and we see that at the food banks, in record numbers. I do not think that is a measure of success that the government has really thought through, because when we are pushing people into food banks, that is not a good thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795252">Before I get into the substance of my remarks, and as we move to the end of this session, I want to extend Christmas greetings to my colleagues, to members across the way and all the staff of the chamber, to the Deputy Speaker and his staff, and especially to all of the residents of Chatham-Kent—Leamington, whom I have the honour and privilege to represent in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795253"> When I bring my constituents' voices here, I often speak of some of the major attributes of my riding, the rich agricultural and agri-food capabilities of my home riding. I often speak of the manufacturing sector and the vibrancy there, but today, I want to bring a fish story. Why would I talk about fish from Chatham-Kent—Leamington?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795254"> I live one and a half kilometres from the shores of Lake Erie. Lake Erie, one of the five Great Lakes, is actually the shallowest Great Lake. It is the warmest Great Lake and the most productive from a fishing perspective. Indeed, I have several commercial fishing harbours in my riding. Lake Erie is home to walleye, or pickerel, depending on what side of the creek or fence one is speaking from; white and yellow perch, yellow perch being my favourite; whitefish; and numerous other species that bring value and food to our communities, locally, nationally and internationally. This is a fish story. Those are the beautiful fish I just named, but my fish story is about a very ugly fish. Biologically it is a fish, but it looks more like an eel. I am going to be speaking today about the sea lamprey, an eel-like fish parasite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795255"> My story begins on November 30, 1829. Why does it begin then? That was the opening of the first rendition of the Welland Canal. In Ontario, we host one of the seven wonders of the world, the great Niagara Falls, which served as a barrier for entry of this north Atlantic-living fish parasite, the sea lamprey, for eons and decades. However, with the opening of the canal, and the great prosperity that it brought, came challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795256">The canal allowed the sea lamprey to begin its way into the Great Lakes system. There is documentation as early as 1897 of discussions across the border with our American friends about this problem of a fish that is actually an eel about so long, and ugly. It has a sucker-like mouth. If anyone ever has the opportunity to have the Great Lakes Fishery Commission folks stick one to your hand, as they come here at least once a year, take the opportunity. It is an ugly parasite and it began decimating our fishing stocks in the Great Lakes, in particular in Lake Erie. It attaches itself to the fish, making the fish unmarketable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795257">So began the attempts to control it. Largely, this was done parochially by the eight states that border Ontario. To a smaller degree, Quebec also has shoreline, but not on the most productive lake, Lake Erie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795258"> I should mention one other fact. While it was documented in 1897, the problem began to really escalate with the reopening of the much larger Welland Canal in 1932.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795259">Attempts to address it were largely unsuccessful and the commercial fishing sector was decimated until the treaty of 1954, the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries, which resulted in agreement and the creation of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission in 1956. It consists of eight commissioners, four Americans and four Canadians, and it worked very well. It began to address sea lamprey control and was housed under what was at the time external affairs in Canada, which provided the funds from our Treasury. Similarly in the U.S., the State Department transferred the funds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In Canada, it was transferred over, post-1979, to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8795260">In hindsight, that is when an error was made. The machinery of government function was transferred in the administration of this commission from the department of external affairs, as it was known then, to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. That was a mistake because it created a structural conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795261">The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is the agent that carries on the sea lamprey work here in Canada. Back in 1956, there was an agreement struck between the Americans and Canadians that 69% of the cost of sea lamprey control would be borne by the Americans, as that was their share of the Great Lakes, and 31% by Canada. For decades, that worked. Research and other activities were cost-shared at fifty-fifty. For a long time, that worked and was managed binationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795262">However, over time, when the funds flowed from our Treasury through to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, were transferred on to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission and then, under contract, were transferred back, the DFO decided that perhaps instead of sending all the funds over, it would just keep what it thought it needed and send on what was not intended to come back by way of contract. That led to the great temptations of withholding funds, of keeping too much and removing the decision-making process from where it ought to be at the binational commission, and it was housed in the ministry itself. This led to friction at the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795263">The U.S. felt so strongly about the value of the commission that even though Canada was not paying its share for so long, the U.S. actually funded our share. Over time, the arrears built up to over $77 million. Pressure increased on the government to finally pay Canada's share. In the 2022 budget, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> allotted a budget line item of $44.9 million over five years to fully fund Canada's share, but even that was not enough to solve the issue. Why? Prior to the 2023 negotiations, the DFO informed the commission that it was not going to be forwarding all the funds, as it was so ordered. It retained funds again, causing the U.S. commissioners to walk away from the budget-setting process and walk away from the table. That had not happened before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795264">Now we have an ugly fish starting to cause an international incident, to the degree that U.S. congressmen have written letters directly to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. This was a matter of discussion when the U.S. President was here in May 2023. This ugly fish was a topic that had to be taken to the highest levels because Canada was not funding its proper amount. The U.S. commissioners had had enough and boycotted. Can anyone imagine this happening?</ParaText>

I would also like to hear what he has to say about fairness for first nations. How can we ensure that there is more fairness when it comes to granting access to fish?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795287">On May 10, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development tabled a report in the House titled “Governance of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission.” This report followed a report from the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, FOPO, titled “Allocation of Resources to the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission”, which was tabled on November 29, 2023, a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795288">In under six months, two standing committees of the House of Commons tabled reports on the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission. Canadians watching at home may be wondering what was happening at the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission that was so pressing that two standing committees prioritized resources and time to examine the governance and allocation of resources to the commission. The reason two standing committees studied the GLFC is that the Liberal government refused to correct a conflict of interest resulting from the machinery of government structure that still exists over the commission to this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795289">It goes without saying that for the current government, conflict of interest is business as usual. This is especially true for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has repeatedly violated ethics rules and regulations, so it is not surprising that the Prime Minister himself came to be the problem when he refused to fix the conflict of interest involving the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795290">A briefing document seeking a decision from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to fix DFO's conflict of interest with the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission through a machinery of government change was sent to the Prime Minister for a decision on April 12, 2022. Nearly two and a half years elapsed before it was finally announced, on September 10, that the PM had finally issued an order for the realignment of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, from under DFO to Global Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795291">At that time, the government claimed that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s order for which we waited two and a half years would finally resolve the conflict of interest. It turns out that it was all smoke and mirrors; it was a deceptive farce. The Prime Minister's order worsened the conflict of interest; it moved GLFC away from DFO to under Global Affairs, but the order also ensures that DFO continues to control the budget allocations earmarked for GLFC's invasive sea lamprey program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795292"> DFO's years of denying the conflict of interest, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s two and a half years of dithering and delaying a decision, were bad enough. Actions of the DFO and the Prime Minister jeopardized GLFC's fight against aquatic invasive species that threaten biodiversity, ecologies and economies on both sides of the Great Lakes. Actions of the DFO and the Prime Minister also strained and jeopardized what was once a stable partnership of the Canada-U.S. co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795293">When the fisheries committee studied the matter, representatives of the U.S. side were very unhappy with the Canadian government. Now that details of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s order announced September 10 are coming to light, I understand that our American partners have even been pushed to a whole new level of frustration with Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795294"> The September 10 announcement put the commission's essential work and the Canada-U.S. bilateral co-operation back on the rails, seemingly. However, details emerged recently that have again derailed the restoration, stability and co-operation, which is why two standing committees tabled reports in the House of Commons, one in 2023 and the other in 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795295">We as committee members saw the fire burning in the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, and did our job by raising the alarm with the Government of Canada. Members of both committees came together and worked across partisan lines, because we saw that what was at stake in the fiasco is perpetuated by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Conservation of the Great Lakes is at stake. Biodiversity is at stake. The Canada-U.S. relationship is at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795296"> I would be remiss if I did not inform the House that the co-chair of the U.S. Great Lakes task force is none other than the United States Senator for Ohio J.D.

              <ParaText id="8795297">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> could have solved the problem years ago. They could have prevented yet another irritant in the Canada-U.S. relationship by simply living up to Canada's commitments in the 1954 convention on Great Lakes fisheries. Instead, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have chosen to ignore the problem, and now the Prime Minister has made it worse; he has kicked the hornet's nest in the backyard of the incoming vice-president of the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795298">The Prime Minister has failed the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, failed our U.S. partners, failed conservation and failed biodiversity, and he has failed Canadians. Who is going to pay for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s failures? It is going to be the same people who have been forced to pay for every other failure he has inflicted on us: Canadians, who will once again pay the price for the failures of the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795299">I sincerely hope that my colleagues from the NDP are paying attention. One member from the NDP sat on the committee as we studied the issue, and I know that there are NDP caucus members who understand the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission issue. They support its being resolved, because they see what is at stake. However, we need our colleagues in the NDP to convince their <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> to recognize the damage the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is inflicting on Canadians every day. We need our colleagues in the NDP to persuade their leader to stop propping up the Prime Minister, who is hurting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795300">We have all heard statements made by the incoming U.S. president, and we all understand what is at stake. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> insists on poking the Americans in the eye for no reason other than he is incompetent and holds onto his selfish ego, above the people who pay for his follies and failures: the people of Canada. We need to restore common sense to Canada's affairs, including foreign affairs, and the Liberal government has shown that it is not up to the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795301">Therefore let us let Canadians finally toss the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> out on his ear by voting in a common-sense Conservative government that will live up to Canada's commitments in the convention on the Great Lakes fisheries.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="8795323">Mr. Speaker, with respect to legal proceedings involving the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, FNCFCS, our electronic system has identified approximately 19 litigation files involving FNCFCS that date back to 2006. This total is composed of various types of legal proceedings before the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal and Tribunals, wherein the Attorney General of Canada is an applicant, appellant or respondent, and the FNCFCS is a complainant, applicant or respondent. Of the 19 files identified, nine files were brought by the Attorney General of Canada and 10 were against the Attorney General of Canada. Our electronic system is not able to identify files in which FNCFCS could potentially be an intervenor or a party in another capacity. It is also important to note that it is not possible to search electronically in a way that identifies all litigation files that may involve FNCFCS. A comprehensive search would require a manual exercise, which is not possible in the time allotted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795324">With respect to the legal costs incurred by the Government of Canada in relation to the identified legal proceedings involving FNCFCS, to the extent that the information that has been requested is or may be protected by any legal privileges, including solicitor-client privilege, the federal Crown asserts those privileges. In this case, it has only waived solicitor-client privilege, and only to the extent of revealing the total legal costs and the approximate number of legal proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795325">The total legal costs, actual and notional costs, associated with the identified legal proceedings involving FNCFCS, amount to approximately $14,545,000.00, over the past 18 years. The total legal costs are with respect to litigation and litigation support services, which were provided, in these cases, by the Department of Justice. Department of Justice lawyers, notaries and paralegals are salaried public servants and therefore no legal fees are incurred for their services. A “notional amount” can, however, be provided to account for the legal services they provide. The notional amount is calculated by multiplying the total hours recorded in the responsive files for the relevant period by the applicable approved internal legal services hourly rates. Actual costs are composed of file-related legal disbursements paid by the department and then cost-recovered from the client departments or agencies, as well as the costs of legal agents who may be retained by the Minister of Justice to provide litigation services in certain cases. The amount mentioned in this response is based on information currently contained in Department of Justice systems, as of November 18, 2024. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795327">Mr. Speaker, with respect to legal expenses incurred by the government for outside legal counsel on work related to the invocation of the Emergencies Act in 2022, as well as any subsequent legal action, to the extent that the information that has been requested is or may be protected by any legal privileges, including solicitor-client privilege, the federal Crown asserts those privileges. In this case, it has only waived solicitor-client privilege, and only to the extent of revealing the total legal costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795328">The total legal costs associated with expenses incurred by the government for outside legal counsel on work related to the invocation of the Emergencies Act in 2022, as well as any subsequent legal action amounts to $3,900,968.93. This amount includes outside legal fees related to the Public Order Emergency Commission, which had a timeline compressed by statute. The total amount mentioned in this response is based on information contained in Department of Justice systems, as of November 4, 2024.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795333">Mr. Speaker, under section 35.2 of the Public Service Employment Act, former ministers’ exempt staff who have been employed for at least three successive years as exempt staff in a minister’s office, in the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, or in the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, may be eligible to participate in internal advertised appointment processes open to all employees of the public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795334">There are no provisions in the policies for ministers’ offices pertaining to the obligation for former exempt staff to declare themselves as such. There is an obligation for the minister or their delegate to communicate with the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner of all exempt staff members whose employment has terminated or have left the minister’s office.  We would suggest contacting the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner as it contacts exempt staff who have been terminated to discuss post-employment obligations as stated in section 3.7 of the policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795335">In addition, as per paragraph 3.7.4 of the policies, exempt staff can obtain a mobility provision if they meet the criteria of the Public Service Commission. The mobility provision offers former exempt staff the opportunity to participate in internal advertised appointment processes in the public service. The PSC manages the mobility provisions and may have information on whether an exempt staff who qualified for the mobility provision was hired in the public service.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795369"> At the end of the day, it is somewhat ironic that the Conservative Party would move a motion expressing concern about the lakes in Canada. Canada literally has millions of lakes. When I was in opposition, one of the most bizarre budgetary measures that Stephen Harper took when the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was either parliamentary secretary to the then prime minister or sat around the cabinet table, was a decision to cut the funding to the Experimental Lakes Area. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795370">Anyone with knowledge, even the member for <Affiliation DbId="278243" Type="2">Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston</Affiliation> opposite in the Conservative Party, should be able to recognize the hypocrisy here. On the one hand, they are expressing concern in regard to what is taking place in the lakes. They are saying there should be more work done with respect to some of the studies and actions being taken, yet the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> today directly participated in the budget cuts for the ELA programs. It is truly amazing. It is almost as if the Conservatives completely forgot about their actions a number of years ago. Not only were Canadians upset about it, but it actually had an effect around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795371">People could not understand how the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> would dump the programs in the Experimental Lakes Area, which was worked out of Kenora. We also had scientists in the city of Winnipeg who were dealing with it. A few dozen scientists were all looking at areas such as acid rain, which used to be important to the Conservative Party, but it does not necessarily care about it anymore. They talked about toxic metals, climate change, mercury pollution and all the other types of things that we find in our lakes that we should all be concerned about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795372">This is the type of work that was being done through the ELA programs for decades. It made it through Progressive Conservatives like Brian Mulroney and through Liberal governments. It only stopped when it hit the government of Stephen Harper and the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, who had the so-called internal wisdom between the two of them to decide it was time to cut the budget, throw the science out the window and let the lakes go whatever way it is the lakes would go. It was truly amazing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795373">Now the Conservatives bring forward a motion for concurrence that says that we are not doing justice to the issue of lakes and it makes reference to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The commission, no doubt, does fabulous work. There are representatives of both Canada and the United States on it. It is advanced in the Liberal caucus and by others who talk so much about our Great Lakes. We have a very strong and powerful advocate for our Great Lakes in the <Affiliation DbId="311645" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. I find it strange that we now have a far-right Conservative Party that has now taken an interest in science and lakes. That is an absolute joke. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8795374">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> demonstrated very clearly what he thought about our lakes in Canada when the Conservatives made the decision to fire and get rid of dozens of scientists who were looking at ways to ensure that we have not only healthier lakes in Canada but also a globally strong footprint through the ELA and the programs it was providing. I introduced petitions on the issue when I was in third-party status with the Liberal Party. Therefore, for the Conservatives to try to pretend that they are concerned with this issue at this moment in time is a stretch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795375">I asked questions of the two presenters on it, and we found out why they have really brought forward this concurrence report. I want to get to the motivation behind their choosing this particular report. It was not to try to convince Canadians that they are concerned about the many lakes in Canada. It is far from that. I recall the two questions that I asked of both the member who introduced the concurrence motion and the member who followed the person who introduced the motion. Both are Conservative members who have been given their marching orders by the self-serving Conservative caucus, led by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative caucus, who has one objective this session. That is to play a destructive force here on Parliament Hill to prevent legislation from passing, whether it is government legislation or private members' legislation, because the leader of the Conservative Party is more interested in himself and the Conservative Party than he is in Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795376">I posed the question, and what kind of response did I get from the two speakers earlier? Well, we got an admission. The first member said that I was right. It is not necessarily about the concurrence motion. He said that the heart of the concurrence motion is accountability, and accountability is really what this is all about. Then the member went into talking about how we need to directly hand the documents over to the RCMP and that would be accountability. That was the response that I got from the individual who moved the motion. Then, the second member reiterated the issue of accountability with respect to the motion. He said that we might not be here for this particular report. This is a mechanism by which they can stick to their guns to say to produce the documents and that, if we were to just produce the documents, well, then they would not have to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795377"> I want to spend some time on those members' answers to the question because that is the motivation and the reason we are debating this issue. Obviously, they really did not think through the issue at hand, which is the concurrence report. When I heard it, the first thing that came to my mind was the hypocrisy of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> because he participated in the cutting of the Experimental Lakes Area program. Had the members thought it through, they would have realized that and saved their leader some embarrassment. I would like to think, but that is not what they were thinking. They are more focused on the grander scheme of the multi-million dollar filibuster here on the floor of the House of Commons, which has been taking place for the last nine weeks. In the words of members of the Conservative Party who spoke today in response to my question, it is, for them, about accountability and the government needing to provide the papers. If we were to provide the papers, they would stop this self-serving Conservative game.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795378">Let me address that point. To be very clear, it is very much not about Canadians but rather the self-interest of the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. That is number one. As my colleague says, it is always about that when it comes to what is taking place here and outside the chamber. Secondly, this self-serving Conservative mentality is actually hurting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795379">As Conservatives try to go out and about, not only inside the chamber but outside the chamber, they like to say that Parliament is dysfunctional. Parliament is not dysfunctional; the Conservative Party of Canada is dysfunctional. It has gone so far to the right that it is a dysfunctional party that does not reflect anywhere near the interests of average Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795380">We saw this when they stood up one by one and voted against giving a sales tax break to Canadians during the holiday season, even though they campaigned on it in the last federal election. In the last federal election, every one of them campaigned on giving a holiday GST tax break. The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> actually tweeted on the issue. However, when the time came to stand up and make their votes count, they voted against giving a holiday tax break from the GST on a wide variety of commodities. Shame on them.</ParaText>

Even though a majority in the House of Commons supported that particular motion to give the documents directly to the RCMP, it needs to be noted that the RCMP, Canada's Auditor General and other legal experts have made something very clear: It would not be good for Parliament to be giving unredacted documents directly to the RCMP. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795424"> Mr. Speaker, we know that water is a provincial resource, but one of the main levers that the federal government has for protecting Canadian water bodies, for ensuring that they are not polluted, is the Fisheries Act. The Fisheries Act prohibits the deposit of deleterious substances into fish-bearing waters, and we know that all waters are essentially fish-bearing. We know that the Conservatives promise, if ever, God forbid, they get into power, to chop expenses like crazy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795426"> Mr. Speaker, my colleague brings up an excellent point. All one needs to do is to take a look at the past behaviour of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. The leader of the Conservative Party was the point person for former prime minister Stephen Harper on a multitude of different issues, which included the Experimental Lakes Area in which there were significant cuts. Dozens of scientists were actually let go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795427"> If we take a look at that past and hear what the bumper stickers of the Conservative Party are today, Canadians need to be concerned in terms of the future of the Fisheries Act, as the member has pointed out. Canadians should be concerned, because all the Conservatives are focused on, as one of my colleagues would say, is “chop, chop, chop”. At the end of the day, that means a lot less protection for our environment and a lot fewer services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795428"> I would hope that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> would be not as much of a grinch but a bit more loving, over the Christmas season, and maybe revisit some of the far-right policies that he has adopted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795429"> Mr. Speaker, I am sure I am not the only member of Parliament in the House who has seen the Great Lakes Commission bring the sea lamprey to Parliament Hill, had the suction of the sea lamprey on their hand, felt what that is like and seen the teeth of the sea lamprey up close. It is not a good image, and I am certain I would not want to be a fish that comes across a sea lamprey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795430">This is the extent of the concern that we are talking about. We know the Great Lakes Commission does incredible work with sea lamprey control. The fisheries committee was very clear that we needed to change the governance to Global Affairs and that the funding stream also be held by the Great Lakes Commission, so it can do this important work that it needs to do and not have barriers in being able to do that work, which is ultimately our responsibility to do alongside our American partners.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795433">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak to this issue, which is very important to me. I will not go on the attack, since I do not think that would be appropriate just a few days before the holiday season begins. Instead, I would like to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, with whom I have been working since 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795434">I want to recognize my government colleagues, of course, along with my colleagues from the official opposition and the third opposition party. Together, we talk, argue and review dozens of statements drawing on the testimony of many valuable witnesses, who are all experts in their respective fields. I want to sincerely thank those witnesses for their graciousness and their generous and valuable contributions. I also want to say a special thank you to our captain, the committee chair, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278098" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> in Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795435">Witnesses include spokespeople from fishers' organizations or management or representative bodies, independent scientists, Department of Fisheries and Oceans scientists, top researchers, processors and other specialists in the ocean-to-table food chain. There are also professionals from the field, fishers, owners, employees, young fishers, retirees and former departmental employees. All of them have recognized and indisputable experience and knowledge, and all are clearly seasoned experts who generously offer their relevant contributions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795436">Now, I am going to take the liberty of making a small aside in my speech to talk about my own history, because, as the daughter and granddaughter of captains, the scion of generations of seafarers, I am not overly surprised by the range of issues and challenges facing the wonderful world of fishing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795437">As soon as I was old enough to understand life, I heard my father talk about the sea and his love for it, but especially about its risks and perils, the bounty and dangers it held. He would make simple observations of the conditions or complex analyses as the vast ocean demanded. It all belonged to him, including the St. Lawrence, the estuary, the Gulf of St. Lawrence and everything that lived in them. All this was home to my father. The horizon, with its telltale lines, and the colour of the sky were his way markers. Even on land, my father stayed connected to the estuary. He would spend hours just gazing out to sea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795438">My grandfather was as wise as an old sea wolf, and I can vouch that he was one of them. He had plenty of sea yarns and tales to spin us. I remember many of them, obviously, and I could share a whole range of stories. My grandfather was a good storyteller, especially after sitting down with a bottle of De Kuyper gin spiced up with a drizzle of honey and a tablespoon of boiling salt water. No more than a tablespoon, he would be quick to say, because there was no need to drown it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795439">He would make observations about the movement of fish stocks in response to major ocean currents or about the behaviour of beluga, which taught us much more than anything else could about the health of the river and the state of the resources. From time to time, my grandfather's teachings seemed more like old proverbs, but there was a lot of truth to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795440">My grandfather would tell anyone who listened that the best mariners did not know how to swim and that is why they had to be such good sailors. He also said that no one is stronger than the sea, that the sea commands respect, respect for everything that it gives, including all things mysterious. He said that we must not think we can outsmart the sea, which is a challenge in and of itself, because if we defy it or underestimate it, one day, unfortunately, it will make us aware of our own insignificance. Grandpa had a predestined path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795441">He was called Ligori. He hated that name. It was after the election in the late 19th century, and his grandfather wanted to call him Laurier. An argument broke out because his godfather, a Conservative supporter, was determined to be the one to name his godson. That is how the choice of name came down to either Ligori or Zothique, but not Laurier. He always said he had no choice but to become a good sailor, because when a person's name is Ligori, they have to find their talent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795442">He sailed his schooner three seasons of every year. Before railways and roads, these schooners were the only means of transportation, helping coastal villages grow. Considering the number of coastal villages along the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence and the gulf, there can be no doubt that the schooners of the St. Lawrence played a key role in shaping the people and their future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8795443">Speaking of the people, my two grandfathers also ferried people back and forth between Isle‑aux‑Coudres and Baie‑Saint‑Paul in canoes in the winter, providing islanders with the only contact they had with the northern mainland. There was also a fine science to conquering the ice. Perhaps one day I will have a chance to tell members more about that. My great-uncle even composed a song about the miraculous crossing of January 15, 1929, which I recorded and performed in concert for over 20 years. Everything is connected. Like fishing and politics, artistic creation is in my blood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795444">All jokes aside, I still remember the precious stories and teachings of my ancestors, and, at every committee meeting, I write in my notes, as a directive or instruction of sorts, that we must not think that we are stronger, wiser or smarter than the ocean itself. Otherwise, it will show us, in this context too, just how small we really are. A good example of this is the overpopulation of seals. The day that Brigitte Bardot and a group of activists used disturbing photos showing what is, of course, a cruel reality, but also just a tiny part of a noble and natural practice used for millennia to maintain an ecological balance and provide food security for thousands of Inuit and Magdalen Islanders, my father, who was a cod fisherman, shared with me his concern that the cod in the St. Lawrence River would become more and more scarce until they almost disappeared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795445">The ill-intentioned exception confirmed the rule, and we all know what happened next and how it impacted resources. Twenty years earlier, my father had told me to enjoy my fresh cod, this delicacy of the sea. He knew that in 20 years or so, the prey-predator chain of human-seal-cod would be broken and the cod would disappear into the bellies of overpopulated, starving seals. The ecological balance would be upset, and it would take a long time for it to be restored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795446">He was right. He did not need innate knowledge, laboratory tests, measurements, or cross-Atlantic consultations. It was just an observation born of his long years on the river with the fish, marine mammals and pinnipeds, the winds and tributaries, the warm and cold currents, the surprising things he caught in new areas. He called that reading and understanding the movement of species. His ability to read those things accurately, his wisdom and respect for maritime elements, his skill in knowing how to read the sea, are qualities I hold in the highest regard, now more than ever when I talk to fishers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795447">My father also taught me that the sea lamprey, a veritable invader of the seabed in the Great Lakes, is also a scourge that would alter the river before long. He thought that the issues of the Great Lakes, a marine area protected and maintained by a bilateral commission between Canada and the United States, would one day be beset by the problems of an overly complex management, which would take precedence over the imperative of acting quickly to deal with the lamprey, not to mention a whole host of other issues. That brings me to my point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795448">The past few months have proven that his science is still sound and has helped me to grasp and offer an obvious solution, as well as to intervene on the importance of considering this solution, to bring it to light for the other members of the committee in order to fully support a clear and unequivocal request from the Great Lakes Commission itself during the study on the management of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. This request concerned the co-management of the commission, the basis and principles of its funding, and the challenges associated with the consultations and communications when the time came to intervene effectively on the various issues faced by the commission, which was then under the DFO's watch. Incidentally, the overall budget had practically no budgetary components—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8795451"> Mr. Speaker, I caught your eye right away so that I could rise and speak to this issue once again and raise matters that are of great importance to the residents of my riding, Calgary Shepard. They care about government accountability and the efforts of the government to continue to hide nearly 30,000 pages of blacked-out, redacted documents that the House and a majority of members of Parliament have ordered the production of and that everybody agrees should be given to us. This is why Parliament is now paralyzed: The Government of Canada and the cabinet ministers who sit in the front benches over there continue to refuse to provide these essential documents, which should then be passed on by the law clerk to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795452">Again, I want to reiterate the point that it is a great privilege and an honour to rise and speak on behalf of the residents of my riding. It has now been over three years that they have given me the privilege of representing them in Parliament. I assured them when I was first elected that government accountability would be my top priority. I did not know at the time, though, that the openness of government and open government by default would be the slogans that the Liberal government would use. In fact, the Liberals even produced an entire document saying just that. It was first released in 2015; it was then updated this year to ensure accessibility. I will be quoting from it extensively to remind the cabinet ministers of their mandate letters, of the document they all signed on to when they took the oaths of office and became ministers. This is the document that the government, from 2015, sloganeered incessantly on for the first four years it was there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795453">Now we are at a point where the government is refusing an order of Parliament to produce documents that it has in its possession, which we all agree we should have. This is not just happening here on the floor of the House of Commons. It is also happening in parliamentary committees. We saw this during multiple other scandals, including the WE Charity and the SNC-Lavalin scandal. This is a repeat performance by cabinet ministers. What document protection they are doing is to protect their own political hides, rather than doing what is right by taxpayers and citizens of this country and just giving over the unredacted documents. If there is nothing to hide, they should just hand everything over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795454">The green slush fund is the term we have been using to describe this. An Auditor General's report slammed how the fund performed after the Liberals removed all the previous persons involved on the board of directors and replaced them with their own cronies. Its original name was the SDTC fund, the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795455">Up until 2017, when a previous Liberal cabinet minister started to muck around with the board of directors, SDTC actually had a clean bill of health. If we go back to the Auditor General's reports over multiple years, it had a clean bill of health in those audits. Starting in 2017, though, multiple problems began to appear. This has now been the issue at hand for weeks and months now. Parliament has been paralyzed because the Government of Canada and cabinet ministers refuse to follow through with that order, as I mentioned. When the Auditor General did the review, it was found that almost $400 million was misspent, corruptly spent. That is just on a sample. That was not all the projects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795456"> Actually, the Auditor General has not had a chance to go through every single project to find out if money was spent corruptly in those situations. In one of the samples, 10 out of 58 projects were audited. The Auditor General found $59 million of payouts that failed to meet even SDTC's own eligibility requirements. If we go through some of those emails that were being shared between the board chair and persons operating within the fund, the board chair was bringing projects of her own, so there were conflicts of interest involved. While it was found that those payouts did not qualify for that particular fund, the emails indicated they would find another fund to get the money that was being asked for. In fact, they did. There was a situation of corruption in that particular case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795457">There was another case of $76 million that was awarded despite the fact that there were clear conflicts of interest. That was on top of the fact that there was a senior assistant deputy minister who sat in every single one of those meetings. That should have been an immediate red flag. That person should have gone straight to the minister's office to inform them of what was going on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8795458"> I do not believe the minister at the time, Navdeep Bains, and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> now can claim that everybody was asleep at the switch and, gosh darn it, they did not know what was going on. They are kind of like a crew that comes upon an accident scene and says they cannot believe the accident happened when they are the ones who caused it. Liberals are the ones who created the situation by inviting corrupt behaviour, inviting misspending and inviting people to take advantage of the taxpayer. That is what they have done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795459">There was a previous chair of the SDTC board, the green slush fund board, when it was not the green slush fund yet because it was getting clean audits by the Auditor General. I believe it was Jim Balsillie. Jim Balsillie has a reputation for speaking his mind. He is well known among Canadians as a gentleman who has had a great career in finance and technology, and he speaks his mind. He freely attacks all sides of the House, I would say, whenever he sees things that do not match up with his beliefs. That just did not fit with the views of the minister at the time, so he fired him and replaced him with Annette Verschuren. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795460">In fact, the same Annette Verschuren confirmed before committee that she has never applied for a job and never had to. In contradiction, the minister at the time, Navdeep Bains, claimed the Liberals hired her from the people who were applying and that is how she got the job as chair. She specifically said she never applied for that job. The job was posted, then the job was taken down and she was awarded that particular position. He recruited her. He called her twice to personally recruit her, despite the fact that she reminded him she had conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795461">Those same conflicts of interest then came up during the decision-making, because she was at the table making the decisions that the Auditor General later found were corruptly made. This is where we find ourselves. A fund that used to function properly, because it was getting clean audits from the Auditor General, does not exist anymore. This is how bad it is. This entire fund was completely shut down and rolled into the NRC, the National Research Council, because that is how fast the Liberals wanted to run away from it. They thought that would be enough, to simply sweep it under the rug, “nothing to see here”, mistakes were made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795462">It is like one of those old episodes of <I>Yes, Minister</I> from the 1980s. I highly recommend them to anyone in the House. Sometimes I will get that whiplash experience, where I will say, “I have experienced that.” I can say we are experiencing it right now. On this comedy series, there is one of those private secretaries at a U.K. committee who says lessons were learned, we will never do it again, or mistakes were made, but it was an interesting pilot project. There was some corruption, but there is nothing much to see here and we should just move on. They admit to it and then shut down the fund completely. It is, indeed, the green slush fund when close to half of the money was improperly spent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795463">The arguments I hear from one particular member on the other side of the House, because it seems nobody else wants to, or is allowed to, rise to defend this, is that there are charter implications, the RCMP does not want the documents and the law clerk has problems with it. Those are all arguments that should have been made in June when we first voted on the matter and a majority of parliamentarians decided the minority was wrong. At the time, the Bloc, the New Democrats and the Conservatives all agreed that these documents should be made available to the public and then passed on to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795464">In fact, the law clerk even confirmed it. I have the sessional paper here, from the law clerk to the House Speaker, saying the law clerk will comply. The law clerk said that “the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel shall provide forthwith any documents received by him, pursuant to this order, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police”. The law clerk has no problem, will dutifully do the job he is here to do, and will then simply pass everything on to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795465">Then in the same letter from Michel Bédard, dated November 18, he goes on to say, “All three government institutions provided documents containing redactions and/or withheld some pages purportedly relying on the Access to Information Act. A copy of the letters I received are reproduced in the annex.” We know there continues to be documents that government agencies and institutions refuse to provide us. One of them is ISED, which continues to refuse to comply with the motion from Parliament that compels it to provide all of the information. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8795466">We know this from past rulings by the Speaker and from government documents, and there is a terrific manual that members of Parliament should be using from a former Liberal MP, Derek Lee. The House has an absolute right to documents. The taxpayers and citizens pay for these documents to be produced. They have paid already, so now they have a right to see them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795467">Orders to produce documents are not common. I would say they are rare. In rare situations, there is an order to produce a document. In this situation, while the government has produced some of the documents, it has chosen to redact 30,000 pages of them and to not see them handed over to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795468">I will note too that a common argument being used by the opposite side is that the RCMP does not want the documents, which is absolutely false. The RCMP has not said that. In fact, the RCMP commissioner, when exiting the Hogue inquiry room, was scrummed by reporters. When he was asked the question of whether he had received the documents, if the RCMP had received the documents, he said that the RCMP did, that they had them, that it would take them and that it is up to the RCMP whether it wants to use them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795469">At no point does the order of the House tell the RCMP how to use these particular documents. The order does not instruct that the RCMP must use them. I will also add that in the documentation provided by the RCMP, in the letter that was sent to the committee on July 26, it also distinctly states, and this is directly from the letter:</ParaText>

It is therefore highly unlikely that any information obtained by the RCMP under the Motion where privacy interests exists could be used to support a criminal prosecution or further a criminal investigation.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8795473">That is not saying that the RCMP does not want it. It is not saying it cannot use it. It is saying in a “privacy interests” matter. Nowhere I note is it said that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was intended to be used as a shield against government corruption. That is nowhere. It was never the intention of the original founders of that document to use the charter to protect government cabinet ministers from accusations of corruption in a potential criminal investigation by the RCMP. That is the lead argument the government is making today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795474">Therefore, let us go back to what the cabinet ministers have all agreed to do. In past mandate letters, there has been a common reference, even in the latest one, about open and accountable government. I will note this reference is to a public document that is available on the website of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>: “Open and Accountable Government”, 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795475">At page 34, under “Public Access to Information and Privacy”, it states, “The government is committed to ensuring that government data and information is open by default, in formats that are modern and easy to use.” The 30,000 pages of blacked out ink in the documents are not easy to use. It goes on to say, “When producing papers in Parliament, Ministers are expected to ensure that requests for information...are met. Matters related to the production of papers in Parliament are coordinated with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795476">Now Liberals have refused to comply with one of the very first initial government documents they all signed on to. They all agreed to do this. They had no problems at the time to sloganeer and claim that they were going to be the most open government in the history of Canada, and they would never, ever, in a million years, dare to even think about keeping something from the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795477">Then we had the SNC scandal. Then we had the WEF scandal. Then we had ministers fired because they did not want to do whatever the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ordered them to do and to hide information from the public. We have learned our lesson as Canadians, as parliamentarians, to distrust everything the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's Office or PCO has to say. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795478">Much of this is at, I will say, the direction of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and PCO to continue to hide documents. This is intentional. The paralysis of Parliament is intentional by the Liberal government, because its members know darn well if they just give the 30,000 unredacted pages, this all ends and this all stops. For every single private member's bill on the Conservative side, on all the opposition sides, we have lost all of those slots.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8795482">Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for recognizing that fact. I was indeed there because I was hoping to be drawn with the high number so I could put forward another private member's bill, perhaps on the disability tax credit or on bereavement leave, which was something the House was able to agree on in Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C-3</Document>, so let it not be shown that we cannot reach some type of accommodation. It actually happened right before Christmas, too. Perhaps we can have a Christmas miracle again this year and have the 30,000 pages of unredacted documents given out to the public so the RCMP and the parliamentary law clerk can see them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795483">It happened before, in 2021, with my private member's bill that was introduced into Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C-3</Document>, in a deal that was made at the time. Let it not be said that the official opposition, the Conservatives, cannot make Parliament work. I also remind the House that six Conservative private members' bills have been passed into law. I think, actually, in this fall session of Parliament, it is possible that we have passed as many private member's bills, on the Conservative side, as the government has. That might even be a first in Canadian history, because of the Liberals' own decisions to paralyze Parliament and not have it proceed with government bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795484">Later in the “open and accountable” document that the Liberals have chosen to ignore now, talking about ministerial relations with Parliament, there is a fantastic paragraph on page 16. I will draw it to the attention of the House. In the PDF document, it is on page 54. It goes on to say:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Prime Minister expects Ministers to demonstrate respect and support for the parliamentary process. They should place a high priority on ensuring that Parliament and its committees are informed of departmental policy priorities, spending plans and management challenges, including by appearing before parliamentary committees whenever appropriate.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795486">It then goes on to say what these priorities should be and that ministers should give information when the information is needed for Parliament to “fulfill its role of legislating, approving the appropriation of funds and holding the government to account.” This is the current situation. We ordered the production of documents. The government is defying its most basic government policy, the one it keeps referencing in mandate letters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795487">Like I have said before, this is not the first time; it happens at parliamentary committees as well, including one on which I sit, the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, where we now have an order to produce documents on a briefing note on the changes to the international student program. The government has defied the order to produce the documents. We are again finding ourselves in a situation where we are re-ordering the production of documents and more documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795488">The most interesting thing that happened is that the Liberal members of the committee tried to throw the deputy minister under the bus and say that if the documents were not released within the mandatory 30 days, the deputy minister would be obliged to appear on the 31st day and explain himself as to why the government did not produce the documents. If anybody out there still believes anything the government has to say about open government, being open by default and doing things on behalf of Canadians and having the best interests of Canadians in mind, they should take a moment to go through the quotations and citations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795489">The Liberals have paralyzed Parliament. If that were all they had done, then I would say, on the opposition side, that it might not be so bad. However, what they have also done is just blown through an extra almost $25 billion of spending this week. They had the other opposition parties vote for it. It is money that Canadians just do not have, so the Liberals are blocking Parliament and spending billions of dollars like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795490">I always have a Yiddish proverb, something appropriate to the particular situation. I know that members wait for it too. There are some I use more often than others. I know that on a three-legged stool, if one of the legs were the word of the government, its solemn ability to fulfill its promises, we would fall right off that stool. We could not lean on that stool and actually trust it so we could sit on it. It is a great Yiddish proverb that is very true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8795491">The current government is the most untrustworthy government one could ever find. It claimed, in 2015, the things I cited; it sloganeered on them. However, it has been incapable of keeping its word to parliamentarians and to the citizens of Canada that it would be, in fact, open by default like its government document claims, that it would work with parliamentarians and ensure that Parliament can meet its accountability function. These things are in the very documents it has never reneged on, never rejected, but it refuses to comply.</ParaText>
