              <ParaText id="2073648">I submit that the bill contains provisions which would require new spending for purposes not currently authorized in statute and therefore should be accompanied by a royal recommendation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073649">Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would add new functions to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act by requiring the ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to establish a new, quasi-judicial function regarding Canadian companies engaged in mining, oil or gas activities in developing countries. Currently, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act does not authorize spending for that new function.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073650">The government did not raise a point of order on the bill prior to second reading. However, during committee consideration of the bill, the issue of new spending was raised, and I now want to bring that to your attention. On December 1, 2009 officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade stated in committee:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073652">Let me explain why this would require new spending. Clause 9 of the bill would amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act to compel the ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to ensure that mining, oil and gas activities by Canadian corporations in developing countries are consistent with the guidelines in clause 5 of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073653">Clause 4 of the bill sets out a formal complaints process to require the ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to receive complaints and conduct investigations on whether the guidelines have been contravened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073654">In a case where the ministers determine that activities contravene the guidelines, the ministers would be required to notify the president of the Export Development Corporation and the chair of the CPP Investment Board that a Canadian corporation's mining, oil or gas activities are inconsistent with the guidelines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073655">In such a case, the EDC would not be able to enter into, continue or renew a transaction with a Canadian corporation found to have contravened the guidelines and the CPP Investment Board would have to ensure that assets are not invested in any corporations that have been found to be in contravention of the guidelines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073656"> Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would alter the terms and conditions in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act by adding a new quasi-judicial function. The need for a royal recommendation for a new function is explained on page 834 of the second edition of House of Commons Procedure and Practice. It states:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2073665">Mr. Speaker, we have been at this bill now for some 13-14 months and here we are literally at the last minute raising issues of royal recommendation, which have already been, in my judgment, ruled on. This bill was carefully crafted in order to avoid the issue of royal recommendation because that is a limitation on private members' bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073666">I take note, Mr. Speaker, that it requires no creation of any new agency. It does not create any new ombudsman. It does not create any new department. It does not create any agency which would require further appropriation of any moneys or any expenditures on the part of the government. This bill was intentionally crafted that way so as to avoid the very objections that my hon. friend has raised. There will be required, within the government itself, a reorganization of its resources, but there are no new resources contemplated by the creation of this function in the ministry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073667">I say to my hon. friend and I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this bill does not require a royal recommendation as it does not require any fresh resources. The fresh resources are literally the prerogative of the government. There is no intention and, in fact, there is no requirement on the part of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> to create any new agency, any new organization, or any new expenditure of funds.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2073668">Mr. Speaker, the issue here that is raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons refers to the creation of a new quasi-judicial function. A function is not a new agency or a board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073669">The procedures with regard to assessing the requirements for a royal recommendation on private members' bills begin with a notice by the Speaker after consultation with the Clerk of the House. The Clerk's officials do a rigorous examination of each of those bills and they report to the Speaker who in turn reports to the House on the possibility of a royal recommendation being required. No such report was provided to the Speaker, and the Speaker has not in fact given such an alert to hon. members in this regard. Therefore, I would submit, for all the reasons that the Clerk of the House of Commons did not flag this for the Speaker, that those reasons would stand in the stead of the member who has moved this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073670">The other consideration, and I have seen this with regard to other bills, is that significant alteration of the role of any body does not necessarily rule out the fact that there is a responsibility for that. I think, Mr. Speaker, you would find that there is no other department or agency, whether it be Foreign Affairs or International Trade, to which this particular matter that is raised by Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would come under. It must be under their ambit; it must be under the scope of their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073671"> I submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is the only place that it could go so that it is consistent with the responsibilities as departments, agencies, and boards, and that this bill does not require a royal recommendation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2073739">He said: Mr. Speaker, I welcome you back to the House. I am sorry to see you had to be put to so much work so quickly. I also welcome back my hon. colleagues on their return from summer recess. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073740">It is an honour to be the lead speaker on Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> in the opening of this parliamentary session. Ironically, this bill has spent some 13 months in committee and over that time the arguments in favour of the bill have actually become stronger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073741">I would never, in my wildest imagination, have thought that this bill would attract so much attention. Certainly, I had not anticipated it would attract so much international intention. People are literally flying in from around the world to support Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> and are encouraging my colleagues to get behind this bill and do something for the world's poor, the world's indigenous and the world's people who cannot speak for themselves. They are literally taking their own time and spending their own resources to lobby colleagues and encourage them to support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073742"> Why would people spend their time and resources and have all of the international attention and domestic attention on what is quite a modest bill? My view is that it is due to Canada's reputation as a fair-minded democracy that adheres to the rules of law and where aggrieved persons can actually come and expect to receive redress. That may or may not be true in some of the countries from which these folks are coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073743">I also believe that this bill has received so much attention because of the increasingly negative reputation of Canadian mining companies operating abroad that do things to people and communities which would never be tolerated in this country. I could literally take members on a world tour. Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the Congo have enormous conflicts with Canadian mining companies. The allegations that have been put forward against these Canadian mining companies are very serious as witness after witness came before our committee and made these allegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073744">It is never a good day for Canada when our own Governor General is surrounded by 200 Mexicans chanting “Canada, go home” because of the activities of the Canadian mining company operating in that country. It is not a good day when, as a witness described, he was chased out of a village because the villagers thought he was a Canadian supporting a Canadian mining company. He deemed it appropriate to take the flag that was on his backpack and black it out. It is not a good day for our reputation. It is not a good day when one of the people who was moderating a debate in which I was involved said that she had recently been in Guatemala where people would naturally ask her where she was from. When she would say that she was from Canada, they would say that in Guatemala it was better that she described herself as being from America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073745">Ironically, one of the great objections that the industry puts forward to the bill is that it would cause reputational damage. Reputational damage to whom? Is it reputational damage to Canada or is it reputational damage to the country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073746">We already know that a lot of activities of Canadian mining companies destabilize governments, put other Canadian companies at risk and put Canadians travelling abroad at risk. Why the objection to reputational risk? Why the fear of a quasi-judicial process where the impartial laws of natural justice actually prevail in a hearing? Why indeed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073747">It is hugely ironic to me that at the same they are complaining about the process, they are saying that they adhere to the IFC standards that are set out in the bill itself. They do not want to have a process to find out whether they actually adhere to the IFC standards because they say that they are already adhering to them. It seems a bit of an ironic argument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073748">Possibly, though, the real reason that the objection is so vociferous on the part of the companies and the government is that there possibly is something to be hidden.The allegations in the aforementioned countries are possibly true.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073749">Sometimes where there is smoke there is just smoke but sometimes where there is smoke there is an actual fire. Did witness after witness really tell the truth about murder, rape, environmental degradation, officials being bought and paid for and paramilitaries enforcing the so-called companies? With all of those witnesses, was that just smoke and mirrors? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073750">Possibly there is some truth and the companies do not want anyone, let alone a government official, a minister of the crown or the people of Canada, actually taking evidence, having a look, listening to arguments and making a finding one way or another, good or bad. Not only do the companies not want anything resembling a fair and impartial inquiry, they do not want any sanctions. They want to exist in a sanction-free environment. They say that the sanctions are too draconian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073751">What are the sanctions? The sanctions are that they will not get support from the Export Development Corporation of Canada. They will not get support from the Canada pension plan. The Canada pension plan will not be allowed to buy shares on the stock exchange. They will not get consular support. They will not get the promotional activities that our consuls general provide right around the world to Canadians operating abroad. In other words, no taxpayers' money, no pensioners' money and no parties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073752">That is three rather modest teeth and I am proposing pulling half a tooth on one of these amendments because we took the view of the Canada pension plan that there would be a requirement to amend the Canada pension plan, which would require provincial consent. My thought was that if the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> could not get his own provincial counterparts to make much needed amendments to the Canada pension plan, what hope would I have of getting amendments? Therefore, we have modified that objection somewhat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073753">Then there is the full argument about extraterritoriality. This is just plain nonsense. This bill is about accountability for taxpayers' hard-earned money and how it is used, not where it is used. Like foreign aid, Canada has expectations and the absolute right to withdraw its money at any time and in any place. So also does EDC and the Canada pension plan. Canada retains the right to invest abroad based on its own set of laws and guidelines. It has the right to invest and it has the right to divest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073754">The other proposed amendment of significance is whereby the company would be given a period of time to rectify its non-compliance. Notwithstanding what the companies say and its handmaiden, the government, I would much prefer compliance over non-compliance. I prefer honourable and responsible mining over no mining at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073755">These are the objections: the companies are too draconian, they will hurt our reputation and they will leave Canada in droves. To go where? To go to the United States, the most litigious nation on earth? To go where the alien tort claims act is? To go where Senator Lugar's bill is, which now requires that Canadian mining companies wishing to list their shares on the New York Stock Exchange must tell the department how much money they are giving governments and government officials? It is an attempt at accountability and transparency, which speaks well for our American friends but does not speak well for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073756">Will they go to Great Britain, which is another great place? It is actually proposing a more robust version of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. The European Union has very high standards of corporate social responsibility. I doubt the companies will go to Russia or China. The only place they may possibly go is to Switzerland. When companies go to Switzerland, they generally want to hide something. If they are going to Switzerland, fine, Lord love them, but they are not going to take Canadian taxpayers' money or pensioners' money with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073757">This really is a modest bill. It has run into a virtual tsunami of objections from the industry and the government. Government members may face clear and overwhelming testimony from those who have chosen to turn their backs on the poor, the helpless and the aboriginal. By voting against this bill, they embrace the status quo. If this bill does not pass, we will have failed vulnerable people and struggling democracies. We will be diminished in the eyes of the world. We will erode our credibility to speak in international fora. We will be smaller in every way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2073758">Madam Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to stand and rebut the bunch of stuff that just came from the other side. I rise today to speak in strong opposition to Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. I had the opportunity to be fully engaged in the committee process and discussions. My presentation will lay the expert testimony and facts we heard onto the record for all members of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073759">The debate on Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> has been constantly muddied by partisan division and a cliché of anti-business rhetoric. I must say that was a great exhibition we just had. The partisan division is along party lines on the frivolous premise that one party is more virtuous in protecting human rights than others. It should be made clear right from the beginning of this debate that all members of Parliament, Canadians, indeed Canadian companies, want to ensure that human rights are protected. We all agree with corporate social responsibility. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073760">It should be noted that we are very fortunate in Canada, in a country where the big bad corporations that the member has tried to make out just do not exist. There is no Avatar planet full of blue people and mysterious trees being destroyed by the big bad mining company. We live in a country where everyone realizes the value of human rights and corporate social responsibility. Canada has an independent corporate social responsibility counsellor who works with NGOs and companies to ensure that Canada is a world leader in respecting human rights abroad. Around the world Canadian companies are noted leaders, practising corporate social responsibility, contrary to what the member just said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073761">Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> should be defeated in the chamber for the following reasons. It is badly written legislation and it has extremely poor process in its implementation mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073762"> I want to be clear. The MPs who are voting against the bill are not voting against corporate social responsibility. None of us would vote against corporate social responsibility and human rights. Canada has its own independent CSR program, which involves consultations, public reporting, third party verification. Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> dismisses the existing collaborative approach and promotes an open-ended punitive one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073763">Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would harm our businesses, which are already world leaders on corporate social responsibility. The bill is often referred to as the product of the national round table on corporate social responsibility. It does not deserve that title. The bill does not represent the round table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073764"> The round table was very successful and it involved representatives from civil society, corporations and the bureaucracy. All participants were happy with the result of the discussions, but not all are happy with the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073765">As previously noted, the government response to the national round table was the establishment of Canada's independent corporate social responsibility counsellor. In contrast to the thoughtful government action, Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> was hastily drafted with no consultations, as we heard time after time during the committee process. The product we see before us is sloppy. The bill, if ever enacted, would have drastic consequences that were never ever envisioned by the round table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073766">In the bill the complaints mechanism is placed in the hands of the ministers of the Crown. Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> converts a process that should be fair and independent into one that is entirely partisan. The complaints mechanism should be run at arm's-length by an independent individual, who reports to the government and that is precisely the existing rule of Marketa Evans, Canada's corporate social responsibility counsellor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073767">In comparison, the bill would promote soapbox partisan antics on the issue. No minister would be able to deem a claim frivolous without that decision being derided by the opposition's partisan political agenda. However, the same claim could be deemed frivolous by an independent corporate social responsibility counsellor because he or she would be independent from politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073768">Unfortunately, the problems with the complaints mechanism go further. Any claim will automatically be perceived as having credibility because of the involvement of ministers of the Crown. Even the most frivolous accusation could be perceived as legitimate. Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> does not have any mechanism to protect the system from frivolous claims and therefore even the most facetious claim could be given false credibility when the minister so-called investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073769">This issue is so obvious that several prominent Liberal politicians have put partisan politics aside and expressed their concern about the bill, stating that foreign governments could end up withholding or taking away permits from Canadian firms citing the minister's investigations. This could happen in spite of the fact that at the end of the investigation there still might be no evidence of wrongdoing against the company. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073770">When Bill C-300 was in committee, scores of expert witnesses came to testify against the bill. Many of the witnesses had voluntarily participated in the national round table discussions. We heard from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Export Development Canada. These two organizations are representative of the leaders of the Canada's economy and the fact that they are strongly opposed to the bill should not be ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073771">We heard from countless Canadian companies that have outstanding reputations and are examples for the world when it comes to investing in the communities in which they operate. We even heard from the foreign minister of Burkina Faso, who appearing on a different topic, spoke of the immense contributions that Canada's private sector was making in his developing nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073772">If we collect the committee witnesses, placing them onto a scale, those opposed to the bill on one side and those in favour of it on the other, the scale will overwhelmingly tilt in opposition to the bill. We cannot ignore the qualifications of the witnesses who spoke out against the bill. They are experts and came with precise concerns about specific details of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073773">I will not deny there were witnesses in favour of the bill. However, they spoke in favour of corporate social responsibility in general and could not rebut the concerns about specific sections of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073774">Let me restate that around the world Canadian companies are noted leaders, practising corporate social responsibility. Canada has its own independent CSR program, which involved consultations, public reporting and third party verification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073775">Bill C-300 dismisses the existing collaborative approach and promotes an open-ended punitive one. The bill would harm our businesses that are already world leaders on corporation social responsibility. In fact, it is important to note that many witnesses stated that the bill would jeopardize the ability of Canadian corporations to purchase mines from less reputable operators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073776">Frequently Canadian companies will purchase mines that were previously run with little regard for human rights and Canadian companies will correct the problem. Canadian companies invest heavily in local communities and bring mines up to acceptable standards. If Bill C-300 were to be enacted, we have been advised this will no longer be possible because the bill does not protect a company from the allegations of abuse that occurred before it acquired the mine in question.The Canadian corporation could be in jeopardy of liability for prior actions by previous owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073777">If Canadian companies are unable to purchase previously poorly run mines, then the local communities will be left at the mercy of the less reputable companies from countries with lower human rights standards than those in Canada. We have also been advised that it will be difficult for Export Development Canada to partner with any mining operation overseas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073778">Mines are not entirely financed by one organization, but are a collection of international investors. This typically include Canadian companies, Export Development Canada, private investors from around the world and other investment sources. International investment partners would not agree to invest if EDC were at the table and C-300 were to become law. The bill would force EDC to walk away from its investment if any claim were made against the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073779">This is highly problematic because Canadian direct investment abroad in the mining sector was $66.7 billion in the last two decades. Putting this at risk would cripple our Canadian companies. If international investors feel that the EDC is default-risk due to the poor complaints mechanism of the bill, they will only invest in EDC if other public organizations are not involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073780">Canada's mining sector is a world leader. We have every right to be proud of the work that our companies do. Our companies have an excellent economic track record and have incredible corporate social responsibility programs that operate in communities around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073781">Canada is well positioned throughout the current worldwide economic crisis, but we are not out of the woods yet. The economic recovery is still fragile. Our commodity sector has led the way for our economy and we must not hinder its progress now. We must not cripple our strongest economic sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073782"> Supporters of the bill will argue that we are saying that if the bill is passed, there will be a mass exodus of companies from Canada. These are the same people who twist the debate into cliché anti-business arguments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2073783">For every reason, the bill is sloppily written, does not reflect the national round table, does not create an arm's-length independent process, creates a partisan political process, has an inadequate complaints mechanism, hinders reputable—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2073785">Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to say welcome back to all of my colleagues, to you, and to the House staff. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073786">I am very pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> on this first day back. The Bloc Québécois will support this bill, because it is a first step in the right direction. Unfortunately, there are not currently any mechanisms to adequately regulate the activities of Canadian mining, oil and gas companies abroad. This is a senseless situation that must be changed. We know full well that Canada is a world leader in the mining industry, and Canadian companies must set an example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073787">The vast majority of Canadian mining companies that operate abroad are respectful of the local populations and the environment. However, it is clear that for several years, Canadian mining companies have been directly or indirectly associated with forced relocations of communities, major environmental disasters, support for repressive regimes and serious human rights violations. Some companies even hire armed groups, such as militias or security agencies, to protect them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073788">Far too many conflicts still exist between communities and mining companies, and far too many human rights advocates are still being abused psychologically, kidnapped and sometimes even murdered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073789">Extraction practices need to be regulated so that they pose no threat to the sustainable development of local populations or their health and safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073790">Those are several reasons why Canadian companies should be held accountable for the impact of their overseas activities. The Bloc Québécois is recommending a clear, independent and transparent process to ensure accountability and to monitor Canadian companies' compliance with accountability standards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073791">We are debating Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> and its amendments today because we need to act quickly. There are far too many people affected by the negligence of some Canadian companies to ignore such a serious issue. Yes, there are currently some serious gaps. And we did not make them up: numerous people spoke to this on a number of occasions before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073792">Like many of my colleagues, I repeatedly met with many individuals and with members of civil society organizations working in Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia and Africa, where the people have been affected by the questionable behaviour of some Canadian mining companies. Their testimonies were all marked by deep distress, great suffering and injustice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073793">Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> is a rudimentary legislative tool, and while it is debatable, it is still high time that Canadian parliamentarians pass legislation to regulate the activities of Canadian mining, oil and gas companies working overseas. The Canadian government has its head in the sand if it believes that the voluntary measures it has proposed are effective deterrents. This government is refusing any form of legal regulation of Canadian companies, saying that monitoring is the host countries' responsibility, even though they do not possess the resources needed to manage the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073794">These countries and the mining industry need to make sure that natural resources help reduce poverty and promote economic and social development. The government should exert more control over these companies' practices and give Canadian investments abroad the tools they need to ensure that these companies' activities truly benefit the people of these countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073795">The government should recognize that this situation is serious and adopt measures that require mining companies to operate responsibly. The government appears to be downplaying the social, environmental and human rights impacts that these companies' practices and activities have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073796">This debate has been going on for too long. In 2005, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development released a report entitled “Mining in Developing Countries - Corporate Social Responsibility”. Three of the recommendations in the standing committee's report proposed specific objectives relating to the Canadian government's responsibility to monitor and exert greater control over the activities of Canadian mining companies abroad.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073797">Two recommendations concerned the importance of establishing clear legal standards for accountability and developing mechanisms to monitor the activities of Canadian mining companies in developing countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073798">At the time, a number of Canadian NGOs called the committee's recommendations “a real breakthrough”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073799">As we all know, the then government's response was deeply disappointing because it was interested only in voluntary measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073800">In its response, the government agreed to organize a series of round tables to study in greater depth the issues that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development raised in its report. Four round tables were held from June to November of 2006 in four different cities: Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary and Montreal. Participation levels were high: 104 briefs were submitted, 156 oral presentations were given and 57 experts were invited to participate. Members of the public and experts spoke for a total of 101 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073801"> Following this extensive consultation, the members of the advisory group, the Canadian and Quebec NGOs, and the experts managed to come to an agreement with a good part of the Canadian mining industry. They published a report on March 29, 2007, in which they asked the Canadian government to immediately adopt a set of standards establishing a corporate social responsibility framework for Canadian mining, oil and gas companies operating abroad. These recommendations are the result of a consensus between civil society and the extractive sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073802">The report recommends the establishment of a corporate social responsibility framework for the extractive sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073803">In addition, it recommends the appointment of an independent ombudsman to handle complaints about the activities of Canadian extractive companies abroad, the establishment of a tripartite committee—consisting of members of government, civil society and the extractive industry—to monitor compliance with standards, and the establishment of an advisory group to provide advice to government on improving corporate social responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073804">The report recommends that offending companies no longer be entitled to tax benefits, loan guarantees and other forms of government assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073805">It took the Conservative government two years to respond to the round table report. The Conservative government chose to ignore the recommendations made by the parliamentarians and advisory group members who took part in the round tables and instead set up a bogus agency that will not impose any rules or consequences on companies that pollute or infringe on human rights. The government's decision to rely on voluntary measures and its refusal to adopt effective sanctions make the communities affected by mining projects even more vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073806">The Bloc Québécois has always defended the need for social responsibility standards for corporations working abroad and for that reason we are in favour of the principle of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. We have frequently denounced the overseas activities of Canadian extractive companies that violate human rights and compromise the sustainable development of local populations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073807">In closing, Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> makes it possible to continue the debate about the social responsibility of Canadian mining, oil and gas companies abroad. A number of groups have mobilized to voice their support for Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2073808">I welcome you back to this session, Madam Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073809">I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128204" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> for introducing this legislation and for his general concern for citizens in developing countries. I would also like to thank him for seeing it through committee and for working with other MPs to improve it. I thank the member, while noting that corporate accountability for Canadian resource extraction companies operating abroad is long overdue. I also thank other members and groups who have worked so hard to put this issue on the public agenda, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="128755" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073810">Many players in the extractive industries have taken advantage of political cultures in developing countries that cannot or do not accept or respect our domestic principles of democratic accountability and transparency. We also know that such companies will continue to act unethically so long as there is no requirement, penalty, or incentive to encourage them to act in a different, more responsible manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073811">Nearly every witness who testified at committee in regard to this bill acknowledged that there is a problem in the extractive resource sector in developing countries, and many agreed that our federal government has the right, the responsibility, and the power to right this wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073812">I am sure that all members, past and present, would agree that legislation that enforces international rights standards and environmental best practices among Canadian companies operating abroad is long overdue. I do, however, have a significant problem with the conduct of some members of the foreign affairs committee that examined this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073813">I stated that I assume that all members, past and present, feel a need to protect human rights, labour rights, and the environment and to stop reckless and unfettered business practices, no matter where they occur. Why did these members deliberately and forcefully stall progress and prevent amendments from being introduced and debated and put forward? I will let their actions speak for themselves, but I hope that they will come on board and make a constructive contribution to the debate and legislative process at this time so that the bill can pass in some form in this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073814">Support from the New Democrat caucus for legislation that would enforce ethical behaviour by Canadian companies, including those operating abroad, has never been difficult to attain. This bill, however, like most that enter this place, is an imperfect piece of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073815">I will repeat my concerns from this past March about this bill. I believe that it is too narrow in scope and application and too weak in its enforcement for my liking. As such, and given that this bill would merely encourage such ethical and morally responsible behaviour in the extractive resource industry sector rather than enforce it, I can only offer my qualified support. Along with my New Democrat colleagues, I remain hopeful that it can still be amended to resolve some of these difficulties and problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073816">Obviously, an amendment to the bill that would see it apply to all corporations in Canada with operations abroad, not just to those receiving government assistance that are operating in the extractive industries, such as mining and oil and gas, would be most welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073817">In addition, it would be helpful if there were a clause in the legislation that would ensure that the principles contained in it related to environmental best practices and international human rights standards could be enforced rather than merely encouraged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073818">Equally helpful would be the creation of an independent ombudsman's office to help ensure that the principles in the bill are respected and to investigate any claims that may be brought against companies with respect to the provisions in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073819">I am pleased to see an amendment put forth that would put an incentive in place to encourage companies with poor corporate accountability histories or that violate standards to change their practices to re-earn the support of the government. I thank the member for that amendment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073820">I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128204" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> for taking such a bold step and for tabling amendments, if that is still possible at this late stage, and for tabling them regardless of what the outcome will be, beyond the reach of the destructive and corrosive behaviour of some MPs who sit on the foreign affairs committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073821">This bill, for all its imperfections, is progress on the issue. I thank the member again for using his private member's spot to table a substantive legislative measure that can make a real difference in this world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2073822">Madam Speaker, I stand before you to speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300, An Act respecting Corporate Accountability for the Activities of Mining, Oil or Gas in Developing Countries</Document>, as well as recent amendments that serve to incorporate recommendations made by Canada's extractive sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073823">The bill grows out of actual recommendations made in the 2006 government round table report on corporate social responsibility and the Canadian extractive industry in developing countries. It empowers ministers to review serious, not frivolous, allegations made against Canadian extractive firms that operate in foreign jurisdictions. Firms found to be in actual violation of the norms set out in this legislation risk losing financial support from the Canadian Pension Plan and Export Development Canada should they fail to make improvements. Currently no investigation is even allowed without the actual consent of the company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073824">Having briefly described what this bill will do, I will now explain why we need to pass it, and I will begin with a brief quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073825">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canada has shown its determination to be a good world citizen.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073826">This quote comes from a children's book on Canada and the world. It is used in schools to teach kids about Canadian identity and about how Canada is perceived internationally. These types of textbooks have a profound impact on our identity as Canadians. They speak of what we once stood for as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073827">When I was fortunate enough to travel to Honduras, Guatemala, and Peru over nine years of being involved in international aid work, I was proud to tell locals that I was a Canadian, and they welcomed me as such. Today our image is changing. Today people in certain developing countries see us as no different from other western countries that are eager to exploit their natural resources, compromising the human rights of indigenous peoples and their ability to manage their own resources, such as water, oil, minerals, and agricultural products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073828">In voting on Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>, we are being forced to answer a simple question: What do we want our children to read when they are learning about the way their country responded to this bill while we were its decision-makers? How shall we reconcile the legacy we are leaving with the values that we claim are so dear to us: fairness, equity, generosity, and social and environmental responsibility?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073829">Today we could choose to be the decision-makers who continue to provide funding that enables socially irresponsible acts committed by a select few Canadian firms. Instead we could act and cut off funding if and when, and only if and when, firms are found to be in actual violation of the respected norms set out in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073830">I will now provide examples of some of these socially irresponsible acts to illustrate why action is required. Let us begin with Guatemala.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073831">The Canadian firm HudBay Minerals stands accused of evicting local Guatemalans from ancestral and culturally significant land. When surprised villagers inhabiting the El Estor region of Guatemala protested their forced relocation, violence broke out. Homes were burned and hacked to the ground. Protesting villagers were harassed, beaten, raped, and killed, or they vanished. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073832">Reports of these allegations are extremely difficult for me. We are all partly responsible and frankly, anyone who has contributed to the Canada pension plan, our national retirement fund, is unwittingly supporting this conduct by association. The Canada pension plan has $30 million invested in HudBay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073833">The situation in Honduras is not much better. The Canadian firm Goldcorp and its subsidiaries are accused of deforestation, of polluting streams, and of illegally altering the course of waterways to support their San Martin mine. Water near the mine has been found to have unsafe levels of harmful metals, and Hondurans living near and using that water have been found to have unsafe levels of arsenic, mercury, and lead in their blood, conditions we would simply not permit in our own country. Goldcorp's environmental record was found to be so atrocious that the Honduran government fined the company for, among other things, allowing cyanide and arsenic to leach into the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073834">Again, we passively support this conduct because we do nothing, while the CPP and Export Development Canada use our money to invest in this company. CPP investments amount to $256 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073835">The list continues and is disturbing. Vancouver-based Copper Mesa stands accused of harassing and displacing Ecuadoreans. Contractors for the Toronto-based Barrick Gold stand accused of gang-raping women in Papua New Guinea.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073836">How much can Canada's reputation withstand? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073837">Marcia Ramirez was pepper-sprayed by Copper Mesa security personnel in Ecuador. She described Canada as being a bad country that destroys everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073838">Despite these compelling examples, I know that many are still thinking about our economy. Just as some rightfully understand that economic prosperity and environmental stewardship are not mutually exclusive, so too can the human rights of indigenous people co-exist with economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073839">Let me now take a few minutes to explain why passing this legislation will not hamper our economy. First, the United States recently passed legislation to regulate the way their version of the Export Development Corporation invests its money overseas, and mining companies have not boycotted the United States. As with the U.S., mining companies will continue to choose Canada as their headquarters, because we are a stable country with favourable regulatory regimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073840">Second, a firm operating responsibly with respect for the environment and human rights will be less likely to encounter resistance from the residents of host states or from its shareholders. As such, firms will be able to operate with greater efficiency, will be more stable in their business operations, and will therefore have access to cheaper money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073841">In 2003, Talisman Energy was forced to cease its undertakings in Sudan after investors threatened to sell off their shares in light of allegations of human rights abuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073842">Shell's operations in Nigeria were also threatened when locals began to sabotage mining equipment in response to human rights abuses and environmental contamination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073843">Professor Richard Janda, an expert in environmental law and sustainable development at McGill University's Faculty of Law, explains Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> this way:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073844">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There is no evidence that Bill C-300 will unfairly disadvantage Canadian extractive companies, and in fact there is strong reason to believe that the opposite is true. It is more likely to create a regulatory environment that would make Canadian extractive sector companies world leaders in the area of CSR, resulting in a competitive advantage for those Canadian companies when operating internationally.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073845">Instead of continuing to let our once-good reputation be blemished by a few, and I stress “a few”, extractive firms inclined towards such irresponsible behaviour, we have an opportunity to take action and pass this progressive legislation. Today we can show people in the developing world that yes, we are capable of doing the right thing. We can show them that we will no longer be “a bad country that destroys everything”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073846">Instead, let us vote for this legislation so that we can once again be thought of as international leaders in human rights. Members of Canada's honourable foreign service undergo rigorous training before they are posted overseas to represent Canada to the world. Some, and I stress “some”, of our corporations go into these same countries and with heavy-handed brush strokes undermine the efforts of our foreign service and paint Canada and Canadians as human rights abusers, militia-funding displacers of local populations, environment destroyers, water contaminators, rapists, or killers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073847">If we do not do something about it, if we do not vote in favour of this bill, it is our children who will read about this in their textbooks as the moment we squandered, the moment when we chose profit over justice when we had the opportunity to choose both. One need not prevail at the expense of the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073848">While not posing a threat to Canadian extractive businesses, this bill represents an important first step towards enabling the government, in the most severe cases, to investigate and sanction conduct that is by all accounts irresponsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073849">We have a choice. We can either sit back and let our country's identity be shaped by certain irresponsible firms whose objectives do not include the positive portrayal of Canada or the protection of human rights and the environment abroad, or we can do something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073850">Join me in ensuring that our children learn of a Canada and inherit a legacy they can be proud of, rather than a Canada that many in developing countries are starting to question. We must grasp this opportunity to correct this wrong, strengthen our legacy, and re-write the stories that, if we do not do something now, our youth will read and see their country cast in a poor light.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2073851">Madam Speaker, I would like to expand further on some of the challenges that Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would present in its implementation. I will drill down, no pun intended, on at least seven substantive issues we have with Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073852"> I should say from the outset that the great Kenora riding is home to vast mineral assets, and in fact has one of the most productive gold mines in the world, operated by Goldcorp in Red Lake and Pickle Lake. Needless to say, constituents, families, communities, and corporations performing exploration and mining activities in the great Kenora riding have expressed serious concerns with respect to Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073853">I am therefore pleased and honoured to speak to this bill on behalf of my constituents.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073854">Many members of the House have pointed out certain practical issues that need to be considered, while recognizing the intent and the goal of this bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073855">I want to reiterate that this government is a firm believer in corporate social responsibility. However, this bill is not the way to promote it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073856">Over the last year, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development has heard from almost 70 witnesses on Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. Many witnesses have raised a number of practical issues with the bill, and these must be considered while recognizing the intent of the bill. I would like to highlight some of the more significant obstacles that they have raised regarding the effective implementation of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073857">First, Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> does not appear to include any procedural safeguards to ensure that it is consistent with Canada's procedural fairness or even every Canadian's right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. For example, Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would not require those conducting an examination to give notice or even consider evidence from the affected company. It would, however, permit complainants to give evidence against affected parties without subjecting themselves to cross-examination. Furthermore, this bill puts at stake the rights, privileges, and interests of an affected company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073858">Because a negative judgment under Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would significantly affect a company's reputation and operations, we owe our Canadian companies the right to procedural fairness.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073859">Second, Export Development Canada—EDC—uses its trade influence to encourage businesses to develop socially responsible practices and helps businesses implement them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073860">The categorical nature of the compliance standards set out in this bill would force EDC to immediately cut off any association with any Canadian business that fails to fulfill its corporate social responsibility.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073861">This means that if Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> becomes law, EDC's ability to provide lending and insurance to companies in the extractive sector will be seriously compromised, without providing any real corporate social responsibility benefit.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073862">Once again, if Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> is enacted, EDC's capacity to provide loans and insurance to companies in the extractive sector will be seriously compromised, and there will be no real corporate social responsibility benefit.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073863">In the last year alone, EDC's support is estimated to have generated $61 billion in Canadian GDP, which amounts to 5¢ of every Canadian dollar, and sustained 642,000 jobs in communities across the country. When we consider that the extractive sector comprises one-third of EDC's total business volume, we can appreciate the impact that EDC's departure from the market would have on working families here at home. This clearly highlights the economically reckless and irresponsible nature in which this bill was conceived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073864">Third, the department already has two mechanisms in place to assist in the resolution of disputes: the National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Extractive Sector Corporate Social Responsibility Counsellor. Both of these mechanisms focus on improving the performance of Canadian companies. This allows for longer-term solutions that benefit all parties involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073865">By comparison, Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> is largely punitive. Unfortunately, in many cases the Government of Canada does not have the leverage over extractive companies that the bill presumes. Junior companies, especially, often do not seek the government support this bill proposes to deny them. In these cases, the company would not be compelled to change its performance under the threat of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073866">The implication is that this bill would see changes we do not want, because a prejudicial regime such as that proposed by this reckless bill could serve only to encourage more companies to leave Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073867">Those companies might see the constructive mediation provided by the national contact point and the corporate social responsibility counsellor as a better way to enhance their performance and be more competitive.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2073868">That is what mining companies in Canada are saying about the bill. In fact, a number of witnesses also put forth that the bill would discourage companies from maintaining offices in Canada. Instead, they would relocate to another jurisdiction. Why risk such a result when we have a strategy that is working? That is the question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073869">The punitive framework of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> contrasts with the constructive, productive, and effective mediation offered by the National Contact Point and the Corporate Social Responsibility Counsellor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073870"> Regrettably, Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> could be counterproductive to the existing mechanisms, since a company might not want to engage in the informal mediation if the information it provides could subsequently be used against it in a complaint under Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. It burns goodwill and good faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073871">Fourth, the bill proposes changes to the Special Economic Measures Act. It is not clear why an act that deals with state-to-state relations would appear in a bill designed to regulate the activities of corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073872">Fifth, even if the consequential amendments that are proposed are applied domestically, the bill may constitute an extra-territorial application of Canadian law since it would be regulating the activities of Canadian companies outside Canada's jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073873">Many countries, including many of our trading partners, would likely take issue with the patronizing implication that Canada viewed their laws as inferior. Likewise, it might harm diplomatic relations if we were to send teams of investigators into these countries, especially if they were in the process of conducting their own investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073874">Sixth, we have serious concerns about whether there is the constitutional authority to enact Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>. The regulation of business, including issues relating to human rights and the environment, is constitutionally a matter for provincial jurisdiction, with regard to property and civil rights. Therefore, there is a serious risk that the regulatory scheme of complaints, examinations, and published findings envisioned by Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would be found to be unconstitutional. Simply put, there does not appear to be any federal head of power that clearly authorizes Parliament to establish the regulatory scheme as proposed in Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>.</ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document> would prevent our missions from engaging companies facing difficulties and would prevent us from helping to resolve their disputes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073876">For these reasons, we feel that the government's corporate social responsibility policy is a more effective way of helping Canadian extractive companies continue to develop a social licence to operate.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2073880">Madam Speaker, it is a great honour to rise in support of the bill. This is a bill about what is possible for Canada. It is not a bill for members who do not want to address the fundamental problems that exist in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073881">We need to have impact on world trade. We need to be agents of our own way forward in terms of how we are going to get good results, good jobs, and good outcomes for people from this globalized economy. It is our champions in mining, in particular, in this case that can lead the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073882">What is most disappointing to some of the argumentation we hear against this bill is that there was a consensus that is reflected in this bill. This is the outcome of the corporate round table on social responsibility. Clause after clause, measure after measure, many of these things are to be found in the guidelines that corporations have for themselves. What is the difference? We are actually going to enact something. We are actually going to make something workable. We are actually going to make it plausible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073883"> As is often the case when it comes to progress there are doomsayers that say all these incredible things that will come about as a consequence without looking at what this really could mean. This could mean corporations will have an ability to resolve disputes. This could be an enhanced reputation for Canadian-based mining companies. Of course, for those of us interested in the benefits for Canadians of companies, it is a little rich hearing from some of the government members about how they would like to see Canadian headquartered companies when they keep rubber-stamping sale after sale and creating conditions under which our mining companies are being sold off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073884">This bill had quite a different context a few years ago when we were world leaders. The government has ridden us to a different place. But the companies we do have understand these issues. They deal with them every day in the sovereign nations that they are part of. It is, I think, a bit of stampeding on somebody's part to bring them away from where this bill could put them, which is in a consensus position; a functional position of leadership in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073885">It is what we need to see happen in terms of trade if we look at our own vulnerabilities in terms of our dependence on foreign decisions in a range of things. We want to start to see not just a code of ethics, but a basis for behaviour on the part of companies in terms of advancing some of the other outcomes that we have. The bottom line has to include some of the bottom line benefits for the local populations and Canada is in that position in a number of industries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073886">Again, when we look at the unspoken in terms of what the government and some of the bill's detractors are prepared to look at, they simply do not see that this is a functional bill that has taken into account all of the different challenges that are there and that the companies actually then deal with a predictable process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073887">It is a little bit like the failure of the government on climate change. To go to the Petroleum Club in Calgary, or to any business enclave in the country, they are talking fairly loud about a government that does not have the temerity to actually invent something that will work. What does business want? Predictability. They actually want to know what the rules of the game are. To simply say, as this government says on climate change and so many other things, “We will wait for somebody else to move”, that is not leadership. That is not even Canadian. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073888">Canadian companies and Canadian governments have led in a whole host of areas internationally. That is not the Conservative government of today. That is the problem. It is in that context of do nothing, know nothing, deny everything that we basically have this reactionary government unwilling to basically have leadership--</ParaText>

I know that is in accord with his own thoughts and priorities. I just want to tell him how much I appreciate that this is the first bill before Parliament in this session and thank him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073893">I am pleased to lead off the debate on a vital piece of the government's national security legislative agenda: Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>. This bill, with which many members are familiar, seeks to reinstate, with additional safeguards, the investigative hearing and recognizance with conditions provisions that sunsetted in March 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073894">This government has put national security and, in particular, anti-terrorism at the forefront of its agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073895"> In the March 3, 2010, Speech from the Throne, the government committed to taking steps to safeguard Canada's national security, maintaining Canada as a peaceful and prosperous country and one of the safest places in the world in which to live. This is our goal. The proposals in this bill represent one significant step in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073896">There is somewhat of a history in this place on these powers. These provisions were first introduced in the Anti-terrorism Act in December 2001 and were subject to a sunset clause. Members will recall that the ATA also contained a mandatory parliamentary review component, which led to two separate reviews: one by a Senate special committee and, in this place, by two subcommittees, the last being the Public Safety and National Security Subcommittee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073897">As the committees were winding down their review of the ATA, including the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions powers, the sunset date on these provisions was fast approaching. As a result, the government introduced a resolution in the House of Commons that proposed to extend these provisions for three years. Unfortunately, the powers were not extended by a vote of 159 to 124 and the provisions, therefore, expired on March 1, 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073898">It is important to recognize that the reports published by the parliamentary committees that reviewed the ATA were generally supportive of the powers contained in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> and called for their extension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073899">Since that time, attempts have been made by this government to reinstate these important tools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073900">First, Bill <Document DbId="3082346" Type="3">S-3</Document> was introduced in the Senate in the 39th Parliament and contained additional safeguards and technical changes to respond to the recommendations of the committees reviewing the ATA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073901">The Senate passed Bill <Document DbId="3082346" Type="3">S-3</Document> on March 6, 2008, with a few amendments, but it died on the order paper when the election of 2008 was called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073902">More recently, in the last session of Parliament, this government again made efforts at bringing this important piece of legislation back to life, through Bill <Document DbId="3735387" Type="3">C-19</Document>. Bill C-19 contained the amendments made by the Senate to the former bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073903">In summary, these were making mandatory a review of these provisions by a parliamentary committee within five years; deleting some words in the recognizance with conditions provisions to track charter jurisprudence; and making a technical amendment for consistency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073904">These changes are also now found in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>. I want to make that very clear. They are all there in this piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073905">With that short history, let me turn to an explanation how the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions provisions of this bill would operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073906">What will become very clear, as I described these proposals, is that they would achieve the appropriate balance between the respect for human rights without compromising effectiveness and utility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073907">First, with the investigative hearing provisions, the courts would be empowered to question, as witnesses, those persons who are reasonably believed to have information about a past or future terrorism offence.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073908">The key here is that the person required to attend an investigative hearing is treated as a witness, not someone who is accused of a crime. It is important to note that witnesses could be questioned under this scheme without the commencement of any prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073909">Earlier, I noted the balance between human rights and security. In this regard, the investigative hearing provision would be equipped with numerous safeguards for witnesses in accordance with the charter of rights and the Canadian Bill of Rights. I would like to set out a few of these safeguards so that all hon. members can get a sense of the careful attention which our government pays to issues of this type.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073910">First, the attorney general must consent before the investigative hearing can be initiated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073911">Second, an independent judge must agree that an investigative hearing is warranted, finding in particular that it is believed on reasonable grounds that a terrorism offence has been, or will be committed, the information concerning the offence or the location of a suspect is likely to be obtained as a result of the order, and in all cases, reasonable attempts have been made to obtain the information by other means. Previously, this safeguard only applied to future terrorism offences and not past ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073912">Third, section 707 of the Criminal Code, which sets out the maximum period of time in relation to which an arrested witnesses can be detained at a criminal trial, would apply to a person arrested to attend an investigative hearing. This is a new safeguard that is added to Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, something that was not in the original legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073913">Fourth, the person named in the investigative hearing would have the right to retain and instruct counsel at any stage of the proceeding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073914">Finally, there is a robust prohibition against the state using the information or evidence derived from the information against the person. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073915">It is important for all members of this place to know that in 2004 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the investigative hearing was constitutional having regard to the safeguards that existed at that time in a case called “Re: Application under Criminal Code s. 83.28”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073916">Therefore, I think all members would agree that the safeguards set out in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> in relation to the investigative hearing are robust, effective and reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073917">Now let me return to the recognizance with conditions provisions of the bill. The recognizance with conditions proposal would permit the court to impose on a person such reasonable conditions as the court considers necessary to prevent terrorist activity. This would prove to be a vital tool in efforts at keeping Canadians safe. As I set out in the various components of the recognizance with conditions scheme, I would ask hon. members to take note of the numerous safeguards contained within the proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073918">Under the proposed bill, before a peace officer is able to make an application to a judge for a recognizance order, again the consent of the attorney general would have to be obtained. A peace officer could lay an information before a provincial court judge if the peace officer believed on reasonable grounds that a terrorist activity would be carried out and suspected on reasonable grounds that the imposition of a recognizance with conditions on a person or the arrest of the person would be necessary to prevent the carrying out of the terrorist activity. This would be the legal test to be met in order to obtain the judicial order to compel a person to attend before a judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073919">Under this proposal judges would be able to compel a person to attend before them for a hearing to determine if a recognizance would be imposed. Now the bill proposes a very limited power to arrest without warrants, the purpose of which is to bring a person before a judge so that the judge can exercise his or her power of judicially supervised release. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073920">This power can only be exercised in two situations as follows: first, is where a peace officer has the grounds for laying an information before a judge, but by reason of exigent circumstances it would be impractical to lay an information and the peace officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the detention of the person is necessary in order to prevent a terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073921">The second is where and information has already been laid as a summons issued by a judge and the peace officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the detention of the purpose is necessary in order to prevent a terrorist activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073922">For example, suppose that a peace officer has the requisite grounds to lay an information before a judge. However,he or she also learns that the terrorist suspects are planning an imminent terrorist attack and the person is about to deliver material that could be useful in making, for instance, an explosive device. In such an example, the peace officer could reasonably suspect that it is necessary to detain the person and bring him or her before the judge in order to prevent the delivery of the material and therefore the carrying out of the terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073923">The bill sets out that in cases where the person has been arrested without a warrant under the recognizance with conditions provisions, that person cannot be detained for more than 72 hours. In the end, if in the opinion the recognizance is not warranted the person will of course be released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073924">It is important to note that if a person refuses to enter into a recognizance when ordered by the court, the judge can order the person's detention for up to 12 months. This is a significant power but I am sure one that is understandable in the circumstances given the seriousness of the harm that could be caused by the commission of a terrorist offence. Moreover, it is a power found in other peace bond provisions of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073925">For both the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions powers, the bill would require annual reporting on the use of these provisions. While annual reporting requirements existed in the original legislation, this is an important change that is found in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>. In response to a recommendation from the Senate committee that reviewed the ATA, the bill proposes that both the<Affiliation DbId="105825" Type="21">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> provide their opinions, supported by reasons, as to whether the operations of these provisions should be extended. This is an open, transparent and sound reporting mechanism that is being proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073926">One of the benefits of having extensive reviews and debates already to have taken place on these provisions is that one is able to anticipate questions or concerns that may be expressed. I will not attempt to address some of those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073927">Some may take the position that these provisions are not necessary since they have been rarely used when they were in force if at all. However, this argument is premised on the view that since these powers were not used in the past that they will not be needed in the future. In the face of continuing terrorist attacks around the world, this logic is, to say the least, questionable. Neither I nor do I suspect the members of the House have the power to predict the future. Therefore it is imperative that we as a country have the mechanisms necessary to respond to a terrorist threat and that we give our law enforcement proper tools to do so. This is what Canadians rightfully expect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073928">It is certainly true that when these powers were previously in force for five years, to our knowledge the investigative hearing power was invoked only once and never in fact held. On that occasion, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the investigative hearing scheme and found it to be constitutional. To my knowledge, the recognizance provision was not used at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073929">I suggest that this is clear proof, not that these powers are not needed, but rather that Canadian law enforcement is prepared to exercise restraints when it comes to using these powerful tools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073930">I would like to restate that the recognizance provisions cannot be imposed solely on the ground of reasonable suspicion. The bill would require that the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that a terrorist activity will be carried out and that he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that the imposition of a recognizance with conditions is necessary to prevent a terrorist activity. This is a significant threshold and not one based on mere suspicion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073931">Some have argued that the Criminal Code already contains similar provisions that could be used for terrorism related offences, such as Section 495(1)(a) and Section 810.01, and that accordingly these provisions are unnecessary. Section 495(1)(a) in part allows a police officer to arrest without a warrant a person reasonably believed to have committed an indictable offence or about to commit an indictable offence. What this argument fails to realize is that the arrest powers in that section apply to a much smaller class of persons than those who would be covered under this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073932">Similarly, the peace bond provisions that I talked about earlier target only potential perpetrators of offences themselves, the actual person doing it. Provided the criteria or the recognizance with conditions are met, this bill would apply more broadly to persons who could not be arrested for terrorism offences in order to disrupt the planning of terrorism. I think all members of the House would agree that this is a class of persons who must, in order to save lives, be subject to a form of judicially supervised release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073933">We all know that terrorism is not a new phenomenon. Since the attacks on the United States in September 2001, the world has witnessed numerous acts of terrorism but, more important, as the recent guilty pleas and convictions in terrorism cases in our country have shown us, Canada is not immune to the threat of terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073934">We as a government and as parliamentarians have a responsibility to protect our citizens. In doing so, we must provide our law enforcement agencies with the necessary tools to achieve that objective. It is equally our responsibility to do so in a balanced way with due regard for human rights. That was our goal with this reform and I believe that we have achieved it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073935">The investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions powers are necessary, effective and reasonable. I call upon all parties to work together to make Canada a safer place to live, work and thrive.</ParaText>

In fact, we had to wait until March 12, 2009 for the government to bring this bill forward.

This is the bill that was originally put in by the Liberal Party of Canada when it was in government. I listened to the proposals that were made by the Senate of Canada to get these necessary anti-terrorism provisions. On one occasion the Liberals folded their tent and changed their mind but I hope that will not be the case this time.

              <ParaText id="2073957">Madam Speaker, the hon. member started off by saying that this was a huge incursion into the human rights of individuals. I was very clear in pointing out all the different safeguards that existed. They go beyond what was originally there nine years ago in terms of clarifying exactly what it is that we are applying to. It is possible that when it comes to the attention of law enforcement agencies, there is information available for past or future terrorist activities. This clarifies and sets out the basis upon which that evidence can be brought to the attention of law enforcement agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073958">I hope that in his discussion as to what he heard at committee, he would remember those members of the law enforcement agencies saying that these were the tools, the kinds of things they needed, to deal with the threats that we were facing. He would know as well that we are constantly trying to update the Criminal Code and the provisions that are on the books in our country to ensure they deal with the evolving face of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073959">Whether we are talking about everything from identity theft to auto theft to white collar crime, all these types of crimes have changed over the years. It has become more sophisticated. If one had said 10 years ago, at the beginning of the millennium, that it was necessary to have special powers on the books with respect to anti-terrorism, I suppose there would have been more skepticism from the NDP. However, we know what has taken place in the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073960">As I mentioned in my opening remarks, law enforcement agencies have been very careful with these powers, which underscores how responsible they are.

              <ParaText id="2073963">Madam Speaker, this is indeed an important matter on which to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073964">I expressed some of my frustration in the question, and perhaps I will come back to it for a moment. If we go back to 2007, when we were considering this whole matter, it was our party, along with other opposition parties, that said we needed to work collaboratively and as quickly as possible to find solutions to ensure that police had appropriate powers but that we struck the right balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073965">At the time, the government was all over us saying that if action was not taken immediately, the end was nigh and this would open the doors to all kinds of threats. It attacked us for even daring to ask questions or suggest that the matter needed to be studied appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073966">Immediately, after the hue and cry about the urgency of how important it was, it disappeared from the radar. Off it went for a long period of time until it suddenly became enormously urgent again when the government re-introduced it in March 2009, again with much fanfare, saying that this was incredibly urgent. Two years had passed and it had done nothing, but suddenly now it was deeply urgent and a matter of national security that we did something immediately and with next to no debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073967">Then the government forgot about it again for a while. We debated it in June. We ended up having a prorogation, which killed that bill and many others, and off it languished yet again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073968">Here we are some three years later, dealing with this bill. Again the government tells us it is urgent, essential and must be dealt with immediately. It just does not wash. It would appear the government is using the timing of the bill more as a distraction than having any genuine interest in getting something done. The Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security should have been looking at this issue years ago and having detailed indepth conversations, which we were told we did not have the time to have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073969"> This is a fundamental problem I have with the government. It raises an issue that it says is of such urgency and no one can ask any questions. It wants to ram it through and does not want us to ask any questions. It even questions our patriotism if we ask questions as if somehow we are soft on terror because we want to strike the appropriate balance. Yet the government takes three years on the very same thing that it said was so urgent. All we asked for a few months to have expert witnesses in front of a committee to ensure we got it right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073970">Why is it important that we get it right? There is such an important balance between collective security on the one hand and individual freedom on the other. On the one hand, every one of us, down to every last single Canadian, wants to ensure that if there is something that puts the country in immediate peril, the police officers have every reasonable tool at their disposal to dispose of that threat safely, to ensure that public safety is maintained and that collective order is preserved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073971">Of course we want police officers to have those tools, but we want to ensure they are only used in the most extraordinary of circumstances with the most rigorous of oversight and that it is never abused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073972">This leads us to the second point. This whole process of standing in Parliament, of asking questions, of having committees is about a process of protecting those individual freedoms as well, ensuring we do not go so far in the name of collective security that we erase our right as individuals to have freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073973">Is that not the thing terrorism looks to erase in the first place? Is it not the very fundamental thing it is looking to destroy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073974">If we accept provisions without caution and we end up going too far, then we have situations like we had with Maher Arar, or Mr. Nureddin, or Mr. Almalki or Mr. Abou-Elmaati, individuals who got caught up in a system that went too far, that cut too many corners when it came to intelligence and ended up destroying the lives of innocent citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073975">When we have this debate, let us have it rationally, let us have it carefully and ensure we get it right. I certainly hope it is going to finally come to committee and that this is not just another opportunity to obfuscate and distract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073976"> In that regard, when the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> congratulates the House leader, I am decidedly less optimistic that the reason it is before us today is because the government is suddenly excited for renewed action. I think it has a lot more to do with a very bad summer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073977">It is important to talk about from where the bill and the provisions came. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073978">After 9/11, the Liberal government passed the Anti-terrorism Act, the package of measures, including Criminal Code amendments, to combat terrorism and terrorist activity. The act attempted to balance those measures with respect for Canadian values, fairness and human rights. Two new powers in the act, investigative hearings and preventive arrests, were considered sufficiently intrusive and extraordinary that a specific five year sunset clause was applied to them alone. The sunset clause was a Liberal caucus priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073979">In October 2006, a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security recommended extending the sunset clause, while also amending the Criminal Code to restrict the scope and application of investigative hearings and preventive arrest. The sunset clause came due on March 1, 2007. The Conservative government then introduced a motion to extend the provisions for a further five years, but in February 2007, the Liberal opposition, as well as the Bloc and the NDP, voted to allow clauses on investigative hearings and preventive arrests contained in the original Anti-terrorism Act, brought forward in the immediate aftermath of September 11, to sunset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073980">At the time, Liberal opposition offered to work with the Conservative government to find reasonable and effective improvements to anti-terrorism laws that would strike an appropriate balance between safety and protection of rights. After the defeat of the clauses, the government introduced legislation in October 2007 that would have brought back the two clauses with additional safeguards. It required law enforcement officers to satisfy a judge that they had used every other method to get information that they needed. It also required the attorney general and minister of public safety and emergency preparedness to report to Parliament on a yearly basis, explaining their opinion as to whether these provisions should be further extended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073981">It is important to note that most of these additional items that came forward were as a result of the Senate, and particularly Liberal senators who sought to improve the protection of individual freedoms in this matter. Most of those recommendations were contained in Bill <Document DbId="3082346" Type="3">S-3</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073982"> I will run through some of the important highlights of the improvements that were suggested to get the right balance: first, an increased emphasis on the need for the judge to be satisfied, as a mentioned before, that law enforcement had taken all reasonable other steps; second, the ability for a person ordered to attend an investigative hearing to retain and instruct counsel, something that previously had not been in place; third, new reporting requirements for the attorney general and the minister of public safety, who must now submit annual reports which not only list the uses of these provisions, but also provide an option supported by reasons as to whether these powers need to be maintained; fourth, the flexibility to have any provincial court judge hear a case regarding a preventive arrest; and last, a five year end date, unless both Houses of Parliament resolved to extend the provisions further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073983">I do not accept the argument that is posited by some that because these provisions have not been used with great frequency, that they do not have purpose. We have to be cautious to dismiss this just for that reason. There has to be a lot more than that. Clearly, these clauses should only be used in extremely extraordinary situations and we would expect and hope that if they were used, it would be an extremely rare occurrence. That unto itself is not enough to not support the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073984">I am, however, concerned with a couple of items and I they are items that we will have to explore at committee. One is oversight. We have to look at whether or not once every five years is an appropriate length of time under which to review this. We also have to look at the provision that would only have one of the Houses of Parliament review the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073985">We saw in this case, after the sunset clauses came, that the Senate did great work and was able to be very instructive with a number of recommendations that are now a key part of the bill and a key part of the debate. I would suggest that a review, perhaps, by both Houses of Parliament would also be appropriate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073986">I am concerned as well about the broader issue of oversight and particularly with how intelligence oversight is left right now. It would be inappropriate to have this debate without mentioning the fact that the government has completely ignored most of the key recommendations that came from Justice O'Connor, which were supported by Justice Iacobucci and were repeated by the RCMP Public Complaints Commissioner before he was let go because he criticized and did a good job. That is what the Conservatives do with people who do a good job of criticizing. These recommendations were repeated over and over again, saying that our security and intelligence services did not have adequate oversight, that it had led to major mistakes and that there was an incredible need to reform them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073987">If we are going to proceed with giving additional powers on the one hand, how can we proceed without dealing with these problems of oversight? Just as an example, the RCMP public complaints commissioner, Paul Kennedy, and again, he was the public complaints commissioner, issued a great number of concerns about the fact that he could only investigate something if there was a complaint made to him. If he had concerns, he could not proactively investigate. If he wanted to get information, he could not compel that information. He could sort of ask, pretty please, for that information to be granted to him. If it moved outside of the RCMP, since most things involving intelligence are multi-agency and therefore involve many different departments, there was no ability for him to track that bouncing ball as it moved through different departments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073988">There were a number of recommendations I mentioned that said that we have to fix this. We have to make sure that when we have oversight, there are no dark corners we cannot look into. There has been a further recommendation that we need to make sure that we have a committee of parliamentarians that is empowered to look at documents and information to make sure that the law is being upheld and that individual freedoms are being respected. That, right now, unfortunately, has also been ignored by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073989">These recommendations, by the way, were not made last week. In some cases, they go back four years or slightly longer, which is almost since the inception of the present government. It is not that the government came forward and said that it disagreed with them and that these were bad ideas. No, in fact, the government came forward and said that it agreed and would implement them immediately. Apparently we have a different definition of immediately. Immediately for me would have been four years ago. For the government, it is apparently just a tactic to stall and to put off forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073990">However, certainly at committee, and now, we have to demand that change in oversight. We cannot have agencies such as Citizenship and Immigration Canada or the Canada Border Services Agency, for example, that have absolutely no oversight whatsoever and continue to talk about granting new powers in the absence of fixing those problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073991">The other issue I am concerned about that is important to mention is that the government will have to understand that the Canadian public and Parliament have a tough time trusting when it comes to matters of security and intelligence. Conservatives might have got away at the beginning, when they were a new government, as they called themselves, with people taking them at their word, “don't worry, we have things covered”. However, simply mentioning the words “terror” or “security” does not give them a free pass, not anymore, because we have caught them too many times when they have been less than direct with Parliament about what the facts are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073992">A specific example, as we know, is when Mr. Colvin came forward with concerns about the way detainees were treated in Afghanistan. Instead of turning and looking at those and having a proper investigation of what he raised as issues, the Conservatives attacked his personal credibility and attacked him personally. They then followed that up by trying to shut down Parliament's ability to take a look at the documents. It came to such a point that there was a crisis in the House, something that had to be determined by the Speaker. There was the whole Westminster system of parliamentary democracy he was looking at to rule on the fundamental right of Parliament to know the truth, to look at documents, and to demand information. Fortunately, the power of Parliament was upheld, but the very fact that the government would try to close down access to that information is deeply concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073993">When the government asks for more powers, to let it have more ability to do things without scrutiny and to just trust it, it will have to understand that there is a great deal of reticence to do so because of that history. There is a great deal of disbelief that it will fix the problem of oversight, because the pattern, as I mentioned earlier, and I am going to go through it specifically now, has not been to respond to thoughtful criticism with thoughtful answers or with review and reconsideration. It has been to go on the attack, to fire, to discredit, and to try to obliterate opponents as opposed to trying to actually respond to their concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073994">We saw Linda Keen, of the Nuclear Safety Commission, who came forward and expressed a number of concerns and disagreed with the way the government was proceeding. She found herself fired. I mentioned Paul Kennedy, someone who did his job with tenacity. I think anyone would have a tough time criticizing the work he did. He was critical of the government, because he kept pushing the Conservatives to make changes that he knew had to be made, reforms such those in the Brown report, which came out of the RCMP pension scandal, or the recommendations dealing with tasers that came from the disaster that happened with Mr. Dziekanski.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2073995">They were ignored. In fact, not only did they ignore him, but when he became more vocal and more concerned and more passionate in his plea to have something done, he was fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073996">The victims ombudsman, who came forward and said that the government's approach to crime is unbalanced, will not work for victims, and is the wrong approach, found himself fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073997">The military ombudsman spoke out on behalf of military men and women and criticized the government. The government often lauds what it supposedly does for the military, yet we had a military ombudsman criticizing it and saying that changes are needed, that there are things that are grossly unfair. People who are coming back from serving their country are not being treated fairly. The government responded by firing that individual. The public complaints commissioner for the military was also fired. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073998">We know that Marty Cheliak, who was head of the Canadian firearms program, went across the country passionately speaking about how the gun registry saves lives, how it is an essential tool for police. He was pleading with the government not to destroy it, not on a partisan basis but on a basis of fact and truth. He was fired, gotten rid of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2073999">Therefore, I am sure that the Conservatives can understand why opposition members and Canadians are reticent to just hand over new powers to them, carte blanche, and trust them. We do not, and those are some of the very many reasons why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074000">There is an issue, though, beyond trust and the way the government tries to hide things and fires people or discredits, attacks, and maligns those who would have the courage to speak truth to it. It is also a function of incompetence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074001">One can look at how it has handled other matters that dealt with security. Let us take the G8 and G20. Here was an opportunity for Canada to host the world. It was at a time when the meetings were going to be on austerity, on the need to rein in spending, on the need to find a way to deal with an international debt crisis. It certainly would have been a great opportunity to show leadership, to hold the meetings in a place that was easy to secure and to make sure that the meeting costs were toned down and that the focus was on policy and substance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074002">Instead, the government first tried to shove the entire thing into a cabinet minister's riding where it would not fit, and then it realized that it could not possibly manage it. The government then split it in half and tossed half to Toronto, basically telling Toronto, seconds before it was dumped on it, “You are going to be hosting world leaders in a downtown core in a security nightmare. Good luck to you”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074003">The government divided it up and completely mismanaged it. It showed no ownership of its mistakes. It did not come forward and say that we need a protocol going forward to make sure, for international meetings, that we have, basically, rules nailed down on who is going to lead and who is going to take responsibility.

              <ParaText id="2074011">What I find extremely troubling in this bill, including the amendments, is that there really is no attempt to have balance. The government is always talking about its efforts to balance the two interests in the country. I see very serious incursions into the democratic principles of this country and our ability to rule by the rule of law, particularly when this bill would take away the right to know the charges and to be charged before being interrogated and incarcerated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074022">Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friends calling for a balance and for more investigation to be done, but it still comes back to this: These are fundamental rights. How long have we had the right to remain silent in the parliamentary system we have in English common law? Is it 400, 500 years? It is fundamental. It was pre-charter, pre-Constitution. It goes way back, and this is a direct attack on it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074023">When we juxtapose that direct attack with speculation that we might need it at some time in the future and set it in the context of the history of this country, the way the War Measures Act was used against the sovereignists in Quebec and the labour movement and civil rights advocates in Quebec in 1970, we do not have a good history of doing this right.

I agree with everything he is saying in terms of having to be extraordinarily cautious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074026">We must ensure that there is in fact a need for that power and it has to be demonstrated. We must ensure if that power is then granted, that there are sufficient oversights and controls of it, that it would only be used in that extremely limited circumstance, it would only be used on a very temporary basis, and that there would be a very strict and rigid regime of accountability for when it was used. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074027">We owe ourselves a debate on this and an opportunity to hear from both conflicting sides. The only thing we have had for the last three years on this issue are bombastic statements about “either approve it now or you are for terrorism”. That is the only thing we have heard. We have had no intelligent debate on this subject. </ParaText>

If there is a clear need for them, then there be very tight ironclad controls placed around them so that there is a regime of accountability that will not allow them to be used. This is a matter that this House has to consider carefully because this is a very difficult balance. It is not an easy balance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074036">Madam Speaker, this session of Parliament opens with two of the Conservative government's favourite tactics: a warmed-over bill that is just for show, or what I like to call a microwave bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074037">This bill is warmed over because this is the third time the government has introduced it. The Conservatives do not understand that we do not support this bill. Despite the fact that Parliament decided not to renew two provisions of the Anti-terrorism Act on February 27, 2007, Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (investigative hearing and recognizance with conditions)</Document> resurrects provisions of the former Bill C-19, which rehashed provisions of the former Bill S-3, as amended by the Senate Special Committee on Anti-terrorism in March 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074038">The purpose of this bill is to reintroduce measures that expired in February 2007 under a sunset clause. A sunset clause sets out exceptional measures that may violate human rights. The idea is to make it temporary and see if it works. That is usually why we have sunset clauses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074039">These measures were investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions, as I said earlier. I will cover these measures in more detail in my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074040">Neither House of Parliament renewed these measures because they were never used. No investigative hearings were held. Not a single one. What is more, recognizance with conditions provisions, also known as preventive arrest, were never used. These provisions had their chance, but they were totally useless. They also had major human rights implications. So why resurrect this warmed-over bill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074041">As I said earlier, the Conservatives' other favourite tactic is making a big show, which they do to scare people. They would have us believe that we live in a dangerous world full of terrorists. That is why the Conservatives make up laws so people think they are being taken care of and kept safe. They put on a show by introducing a totally useless bill to convince people that the government is really taking their safety seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074042">I have to say that I am getting a little tired of the way they scare people and keep bringing back the same old same old. The Conservatives are using fear of terrorism and fear of criminals to introduce and reintroduce crime bills. It is the same thing over and over again. Simply put, they are using fear of terrorism to justify attacks on human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074043">From December 2004 to March 2007, we heard from witnesses, read briefs, and questioned experts, representatives of civil society, and law enforcement officials. The Bloc Québécois made its position known. We felt that the investigative process needed better guidelines, and that this exceptional measure should be used only in specific cases in which it is necessary to prohibit activities where there is imminent peril of serious damage, and not in the case of misdeeds already committed. We were also firmly opposed to the provision dealing with preventive arrest and recognizance with conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074044">Our position has not changed since 2007. We will vote against this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074045">We made comments during the debate. Because there was a debate. I do not understand why my Liberal colleague thinks it is so important for us to have a debate. We have debated it. The Senate has debated it. We have talked about it. What is there left to say? If it is no good, it is no good, and we move on. There are things we can do to fight terrorism.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2074046">It is clear that they have not considered any of our suggestions. A number of recommendations were made by both the House of Commons and Senate committees that examined this issue. These recommendations were dismissed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074047">As usual, the Conservative government wants to have its own way, forgetting that in a free and democratic society, there must be a real balance between security and respect for human rights. The goal of terrorism is, of course, to force people live in a state of terror and to cause the rights of individuals to be violated. And in this, the terrorists will win, in what I can only characterize as a world war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074048">Let us take a closer look at the two provisions that this government is attempting to reintroduce. First, let us look at the provision concerning investigative hearings. Section 2 deals with sections 83.28 to 83.3 of the Criminal Code under which, generally speaking, a peace officer could—with the prior consent of the Attorney General—apply to a provincial court or superior court judge for an order for the gathering of information. The order, if made, requires the named person to appear before a judge for examination and to bring any information in his or her possession. The person named in the order loses the right to remain silent. It is as simple as that. In addition, section 83.29 states that a warrant of arrest can be issued for anyone evading the investigative hearing. So you lose your right to remain silent and if you are not happy about it, you can be arrested. That is more or less what this means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074049">In fact, the police never use this provision because, in a routine investigation, they can question witnesses and carry out search warrants to obtain documents. This is already covered in the Criminal Code and it is already very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074050">Now, let us look at the other provision, which is even worse: recognizance with conditions, or preventive arrest as it is called in section 83.3. At this time, it already exists in the Criminal Code as section 495, which says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074051">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A peace officer may arrest without warrant:</QuotePara>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) a person who...on reasonable grounds, he believes...is about to commit an indictable offence;</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074053">So preventive arrest already exists as section 495 of the Criminal Code. A person who is arrested under this section must be brought before a judge who can impose conditions, in the same manner as the Anti-terrorism Act. The judge can even refuse bail if he believes that freeing the person could prove prejudicial or jeopardize someone's safety, thus representing a threat to public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074054">We can see that this provision has not really been used because, in any event, the police already have the tools they need to do their job. It is simple. For example, if police officers believe that a person is about to commit an act of terrorism, then they have knowledge of a plot. They probably know, based on wiretap or surveillance information, that an indictable offence is about to be committed. Therefore, they have proof of a plot or attempt and need only lay a charge in order to arrest the person in question. They are already able to do so. There will eventually be a trial, at which time the arrested person will have the opportunity to a full answer and defence, as in any lawful society. The person will be acquitted if the suspicions are not justified; or, if there is sufficient proof that the person indeed wanted to commit an act of terrorism, they can be charged. It seems that the terrorist act thus apprehended would have been disrupted just as easily as it would have been had section 83.3 been used. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2074055">However, the preventive arrests the government wants to reinstate would allow for the arrest of a person who is not necessarily the one who is believed likely to commit a terrorist act, but only and simply a person whose arrest is necessary to prevent the carrying out of the terrorist activity. That is a significant nuance that can result in arbitrary arrests and target completely innocent people who have nothing to do with the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074056"> Some saw section 810 of the Criminal Code as being quite similar to section 83.3. Section 810 can employ the same type of procedure as section 83.3. While there is a similarity in the procedures followed in these two sections, there is a very big difference in their application. Section 810 talks about a summons, while section 83.3 talks about preventive arrest. Section 810 states that a person can be summoned before a judge, who can order that person to maintain the peace, which is not the same as the provision in section 83.3 whereby a person can be arrested because they are suspected of being a terrorist. Such an arrest is not based on fact, but on the suspicion that the person might be a terrorist. He is therefore arrested as a preventive measure. There is a big difference between these two sections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074057">It is extremely dangerous to create laws that are useless and violate the basic principles of criminal law, which seeks a balance between public safety and human rights. Whether we like it or not, it could lead to abuse sooner or later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074058">We should ask ourselves the following question: how can we wage an effective and intelligent war against terrorism? That is a very difficult question because, as with any form of crime, there is no simple, quick fix. Fighting crime or terrorism takes time and is very difficult because causes of such phenomena are numerous and complex. The solutions to such problems cannot be overly simplistic and consist merely of new Criminal Code provisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074059">We have to attack the root of terrorism. That involves fighting poverty, not just in Canada and Quebec, but throughout the world. We live increasingly in an interrelated world, in an era of globalization. The world is becoming smaller as a result of the Internet and all rapid information systems. Regions are being abandoned and left in the hands of fundamentalists. We must fight urban violence and prevent ethnic wars. The war in Iraq, which was a great American lie, the rise of global conservatism, racism, intolerance of differences, communitarianism, the increasing Islamophobia in Canada and the world, must all be battled. I could list many more causes, but I will focus on something in which I have been especially interested for some time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074060">In order to effectively combat terrorism, we need to have professional, competent intelligence agencies and expert police services that are able to conduct investigations properly. The intelligence agency must be given the necessary resources to do the job, for it costs money. Canada has an intelligence agency, CSIS. Does that agency have sufficient financial resources to combat terrorism? It has a budget of half a billion dollars, which, I believe, is sufficient. The other fundamental question is whether it is competent and professional. That is the real question.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2074061">I conducted a little analysis of my own. I began to look at certain points, which I will share with the House. Very recently, retired Supreme Court judge John Major released his report on the Air India tragedy. The report harshly criticized CSIS and the RCMP. I will not dwell on that report for too long, because I do not have enough time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074062">One thing I would like to point out, however, is that CSIS has the discretionary authority to not share pertinent information with the police, including the RCMP. Furthermore, it was this lack of communication between the RCMP and CSIS that largely, and unfortunately, prevented this terrorist threat from being identified and averted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074063">On page 82 of volume three, the report states: “There is evidence that the discretion in section 19(2)(a) was used, especially in the early stages of the post-bombing investigation, to thwart full cooperation by CSIS with the RCMP.” I will not read the next part. However, there is a quotation, which states: “...we can only provide them investigational leads”. This illustrates the problem that exists in the legislation governing CSIS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074064">Furthermore, a Canadian Press article from June 17, 2010, reported that the former judge said that “agencies were not prepared for the threat of terror attacks in 1985—and holes in the country's security systems still need plugging”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074065">I also had a look at another issue regarding CSIS. Obviously, we had that scathing report, but there is also the matter of the current director, Mr. Fadden. I do not know whether you followed this during the summer, but the committee met and invited Mr. Fadden to speak about the allegations he made on CBC television. In committee, the Bloc tried to present a motion calling for the resignation of Mr. Fadden, the Director of CSIS, in light of the comments he made on the CBC. Because now we have a CSIS director who put on a show for the media. We have never seen that before. Generally, CSIS directors are very discreet. He came to the committee to apologize, but he made allegations to whoever would listen that ministers—we do not know where, we do not know who—and elected officials in British Columbia—we know where, but we do not know who—were agents of influence from foreign countries like China and the Middle East. What did he base this on? We do not know. But we do know the serious consequence of this type of unfounded and unsupported claims. Now the witch hunt is on to find out who these ministers are, who these elected officials in B.C. are who are agents of influence. He has already made similar statements in which he accused certain NGOs and advocacy groups of being sympathetic to terrorists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074066">These are the types of accusations we hear from this government when we do not vote in line with them: that we work with criminals and support terrorists. We have to wonder about the fact that an agency like this is being managed by a leader like that. We have been waiting for Mr. Fadden's resignation, which has still not happened. So let us ask this: was he simply following directions from higher up? We would like to know what is going on on the other side of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074069">I will try to cover my last point quickly. It is about statements that appeared in the Canadian Press in September 2010. According to the statements, Mr. Fadden received a memo stating that CSIS is using information obtained through torture. I want to point out that we debated this in the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security in March 2009. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074073">The saga began on March 5, 2009, in the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security when the executive director of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, Ms. Pollack, appeared as a witness. I asked her if CSIS uses, has used, or will use, information obtained by torture and if so, is it reliable? I will read to you what she said in response. It is quite something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074074"> As for the first question, related to information obtained through torture, there is a decision that has been rendered by a member of this committee in the context of a complaint that was made, in which it was determined that at times, yes, CSIS does use information that was obtained through torture and that their overriding focus in doing so.... Obviously they do so in the context of investigating threats to the security of Canada. Is this information reliable? Naturally her response was “no”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074075">I will be told, of course, that that was the answer given by Ms. Pollack of the Security Intelligence Review Committee. But what does CSIS have to say about this? The same day, March 5, we were also joined by a CSIS representative, Mr. O'Brien, operations and legislation advisor for CSIS. I asked him the very same question. Mr. O'Brien is a very honest person, for he told the truth. After skating around the issue for a bit, he finally replied as follows:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Frankly, I'm tempted to say that there are four words that can provide a simple answer, and those four words are either—and this is the skating around—“yes, but” or “no, but”, and the “yes, but” is, do we use information that comes from torture? And the answer is that we only do so if lives are at stake. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="2074078">So a public safety minister and the head of CSIS at the time appeared before the committee and told us to our face that Canada does not use this kind of information. They said so to our face. But what have we learned since? On September 13, 2010, a briefing note intended for Mr. Fadden specified that even though such information could not be used in a court of law to prosecute someone who poses an imminent threat, the government—the Conservative government—must make use of the information to attempt to disrupt that threat before it materializes. That is the reality at CSIS.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074080"> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. No one has the right to torture anyone. No one has the right to use information obtained through torture. Canada has signed conventions prohibiting the use of torture. Canada—and by extension, every agency, department and body under its authority—must uphold these conventions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074081"> CSIS is not above the law. Its purpose is to carry out threat assessments. The worst part of all this is that CSIS says that it uses information obtained through torture. This is dangerous because such information sources are not reliable. CSIS is, therefore, producing inaccurate assessments. And if its assessments are inaccurate, we need to ask ourselves how this is affecting our security. We are essentially entrusting this agency with the duty to conduct assessments regarding the threat of terrorism when it has clearly stated that on occasion it uses information obtained through torture—inaccurate information—when it sees an extreme threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074082">The Omar Khadr case is the best example and clearest evidence of this. He admitted under torture that he saw Maher Arar in an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. And yet we now know that this is not true. But that is to be expected. When you are 15 years old and end up in Guantanamo being tortured, you will go so far as to say that you have seen extraterrestrials. You will say any absurd thing just so that they stop torturing you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074083"> Statistically—and all the studies show this—information obtained through torture is not only immoral, it is unreliable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074084"> So we have one agency, which is giving unreliable information to the RCMP, which in turn spends our money conducting investigations based on unreliable information. The worst part is that we give them half a billion dollars a year to carry out this kind of assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074085"> Instead of passing legislation introducing two useless provisions, we need to properly overhaul the law governing CSIS and review the way it does things. That is what we need to do. We should not be debating two completely pointless clauses today; we should be talking about what needs to be done with CSIS in order to make it effective, competent and accountable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074086">Madam Speaker, whenever I get up to speak to legislation that purports to fight terrorism, I think of a rule that I had for my staff when I was practising law and a rule that I had and still have for my campaign workers. I tell them not to panic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074087">There are times when I have even thought seriously about perhaps having an amendment in our Constitution that would compel political leaders of whatever political stripe not to panic in a time of crisis. This happened in 2001 and in 1970 with the War Measures Act. It happened during the second world war with our shabby treatment of Japanese Canadian citizens. It happened in the first and second world war with the way we treated Italian and German Canadians, longtime citizens of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074088">When facing a crisis, we as political leaders feel that we have to do something even when all the evidence shows that the structures we have, the strength of our society, the strength of our laws, are enough to deal with it. We passed legislation in early 2002 to deal with terrorism when we panicked. We have learned in the last eight years that there was no need for that legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074089">The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> today said that we might need it. If it was not for the fact that we are dealing with fundamental human rights and fundamental civil liberties, there might be some merit and some logic to that argument, but these two sections of the anti-terrorism legislation are talking about a serious incursion into rights that have existed in this country since pre-Confederation, rights that go back four or five hundred years to the common law of England. One of my colleague's made that point in a speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074090">The vast majority of our children in elementary school know they are supposed to have the absolute right to remain silent. The whole weight of the state cannot be used against someone to force him or her to testify against himself or herself. As we heard just now from the Bloc, a part of that has been used historically. Torture has been used to force people to confess, to make statements against their own interests. We had the fundamental right to remain silent until this legislation came into effect in Canada. Set in that context, there is absolutely no justification for us to have this type of attack on those fundamental rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074091">We hear speculation about this or that possibly happening and this type of legislation being needed in those circumstances. 9/11 was nine years ago and we have not needed it that whole time. There have been incidents of people contemplating violence for political ends, one of the definitions of terrorism. We never needed this type of legislation in any of those incidents. One of the former directors of CSIS, Reid Morden, has come out publicly and confirmed that we have not needed it. He said, “There is no need for this type of incursion into those fundamental rights”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074092">We also have to set in context the history of this country when we look at the way the War Measures Act was used during the second world war against Japanese Canadians and the way it was used against a wide swath of the population of Quebec in 1970.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2074093">I always tell this story with regard to the not panicking. The justice minister of that day was my predecessor from my riding, a law dean, and very well-educated. I remember having a breakfast meeting with him, in Windsor, about 48 hours before the War Measures Act was invoked. What he said to me at that time was, “We don't know what's going on in the province of Quebec. We don't know if there is in fact an apprehended insurrection occurring there. We just don't know”. And yet, less than 48 hours later, the then Prime Minister involved the War Measures Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074094">What did we see at that time, in terms of the relevancy of this? We saw labour leaders, we saw members of civil society, with broad sweeps, incarcerated. No explanation. No charges. Some kept for short periods of time. A large number kept for weeks and even into a month or more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074095">I have to say in spite of the protestations by the government, and I have to say the Liberals and the official opposition, of some of the protections it is trying to build in, that risk still exists with this legislation if it were to become the law of the land. Because when we panic and we start making decisions based on that, whether it is political leaders, whether it is prosecutors, whether it is police, judgment goes out the window. Those fundamental rights get breached rapidly and dramatically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074096">The bottom line is that it is not worth the risk to pass this legislation to have that incursion into our fundamental rights in this country for what might happen in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074097">I want to make this other point which I made earlier when I was asking a question of the justice minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074098">We had extensive hearings when the review occurred of the anti-terrorism legislation. We did those in 2006 into early 2007. We had a large number of witnesses come before us to try to justify this type of legislation. They were repeatedly asked, “What are the scenarios?” and they would describe scenarios where they thought they could use this legislation, none that had ever occurred in Canada up to that point and none that have occurred since then either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074099">However, when pressed about other sections of the Criminal Code that could be used for charges at that time, or sections in the Canada Evidence Act that could be used to justify getting out the information they needed, without exception that I can recall, and I think I am accurate on this, there was not one of those scenarios which stood up to an analysis of why we needed this legislation which is what we already have in our law as tools for our officers to use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074100">I want to digress for just a second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074101"> I really do not think it lies in the mouth of the Conservative government to try to justify the use of this legislation because it is being asked to do so by our police forces. Our police forces are not out lobbying for this legislation. They are out lobbying to hold on to the gun registry and the government is ignoring them 100%, in fact, in many cases, accusing them of misleading facts and ignoring all of the recommendations from them, which are based on facts, in that situation, as opposed to speculation under this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074102">They are trying to build in these protections, which is an admission of how much this could affect us, and in fact will affect us, I say that without hesitation, in another crisis as individual citizens of this country. Will it be the first nations? Will it be the sovereignists in Quebec? Will it be the labour movement? Will it be radical students? We do not know who the target will be, but there will be a target group and it will be used against them when the government goes into that panic phase.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2074103">The Liberals' reliance on the review being done by both the Senate and the House gives me no sense of comfort. When this comes up for review again, should the law ever get through, I have no comfort in it being turned over to an unelected Senate that has been stacked or will be in another few months by the Conservatives. I have no sense of comfort that that body will protect these fundamental rights of all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074104">What are we trying to do here? I hear from both the Conservatives and the Liberals that we are trying to strike a balance. The fundamental rule is that we do not compromise on fundamental rights, whether it is here in this country or at the international level. The right to remain silent is a fundamental right. The right to not be incarcerated without charge and without knowing the charge is a fundamental right. There is no compromise on fundamental rights. If we use that as our guideline, then we must vote against this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074105">I could go into the details of some of the objections that I am hearing from Conservatives, in particular to our position, but when we look at the protection they are trying to build in, it is just not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074106">One of my colleagues earlier today pointed out that with regard to the right to remain silent, we do not have that any more. We must give information. The Conservatives have now tried to build into the legislation a right to have counsel which was not there before in the prior legislation. It was not there in one of the original drafts of the legislation either. However, those two sections are completely contradictory. I, quite frankly, do not know what a court will do. My sense is that it will determine that in fact one does not have a right to counsel, that one must give the evidence that is being demanded if one does not have time to get counsel in to assist them. This is another fundamental right that was created by the charter, long-standing in our country, and it will go by the wayside if the bill goes through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074107">The rules are: we do not panic when we are in a crisis situation; we never compromise on fundamental rights, which is what is being proposed here; and we should not rely on an unelected Senate to protect those fundamental rights, which is also being proposed. Certainly, when we look at the so-called protections that are here in this incursion, they are not there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074109">Surely the member is aware of court decisions that were very adamant in ensuring that the right to counsel of the choice of the detainee would be inserted in the law. Surely he thinks that could be either made by way of amendment at committee or perhaps even be proposed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074110">With that provision, which is the salient point that the courts have opined upon, would the member not be comfortable with the charter in place, with the right to counsel and finally his statement that these are fundamental rights, right to counsel and right against self-incrimination? Does he not concede that section 1 of the charter, which overrides, in the case of national security, certain fundamental rights exist and has been held by the courts, the Supreme Court of Canada in fact, to have been applied?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074111">In other words, does the member not concede that even though we have not used these provisions we may need these provisions and that it is prudent government to look at legislation that takes into account the modern laws, not the laws of the 1940s, which his speech was, with all due respect, replete with?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074113">Mr. Speaker, I have spent 15 years and made over 550 access to information requests to uncover the true costs of the wasteful long gun registry. The registry does not improve public safety in a cost effective way. First, it only targets law-abiding citizens; second, front line police officers do not rely on the long gun registry data because to do so would put their lives in danger; third, laying a piece of paper beside a gun does not prevent crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074114">Above all this is the overwhelming cost. At a price tag of well over $1 billion, only about one-third to one-half of the rifles and shotguns in Canada have been registered. A police chief in Saskatchewan has warned me that if we do not get rid of the long gun registry, it will cost at least another $1 billion to register the rest of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074115">Are Canadians willing to squander up another $1 billion to register the remaining firearms or would they rather spend the money targeting organized crime and real criminals that are threatening the peace in our communities?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074720">  Mr. Speaker, in response to (a),the federal Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons, IWGTIP, was formally mandated in early 2004 to coordinate all federal efforts to combat trafficking in persons. Prior to that time, the IWGTIP was an informal group of a few federal departments that focused primarily upon supporting the development of Canada’s negotiating position for the United Nations’ Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, under the Convention Against Transnational Crime and its subsequent implementation upon Canadian ratification. The IWGTIP last met on May 12, 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074721">In response to (b), the frequency of IWGTIP meetings has varied over the years, rangingfrom as often as monthly to the current approach of meeting at least quarterly, depending upon the nature and timing of activities being addressed by the IWGTIP. As well, informal subgroups of the IWGTIP may meet periodically, as and when required, to support IWGTIP efforts including, for example, to facilitate Canadian participation in the Forum to Fight Human Trafficking, held in February 2008 as part of the United Nations’ Global Initiative to Fight Trafficking, “UN.GIFT”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074722">In response to (c), the specifics of the agenda for IWGTIP meetings vary, depending on the current activities combatting human trafficking.  However, at their core, discussions are focused on the key pillars of the IWGTIP’s mandate: the prevention of trafficking, e.g., the status of current public education/awareness initiatives; the protection of victims; the prosecution of offenders; and, more generally, to provide a vehicle for supporting the Government of Canada’s ability to respond to trafficking in persons both domestically and abroad, and in conjunction with relevant partners. Toward this end, discussions generally revolve around current/completed or forthcoming federal activities, e.g., status updates on related parliamentary business; federal professional training and public awareness activities; federal input to or participation in domestic or international initiatives, member Departments updating the group on their new/ongoing/forthcoming anti-trafficking initiatives, and updates on initiatives/conferences/developments at the domestic and international levels.  Many of these activities are noted on the government’s Trafficking In Persons website http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/fs-sv/tp. Over the years, there have also been periodic opportunities for non-federal governmental groups to meet with the IWGTIP to mutually exchange/update each other on respective anti-trafficking efforts.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="2074743">  Mr. Speaker, in response to (a) and (b), 

in May 2008, the Minister of Public Safety announced the establishment of the Task Force on Illicit Tobacco Products.  The task force is led by PS and includes departments and agencies that are involved in tackling the issue of contraband tobacco, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, RCMP, the Canada Border Services Agency, CBSA, the Canada Revenue Agency, Finance Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Health Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074744">The task force is mandated to identify the facilitating circumstances for each source of illicit tobacco, scope out the issue and what is currently being done to address the problem, identify gaps in our collective efforts, and explore approaches to address the illicit trade in tobacco products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074745">In July 2009, after extensive consultation with federal partners and industry stakeholders, the task force completed its analysis in which it identifies several options to reduce both the supply of, and demand for, illicit tobacco products in Canada.  A copy of the task force report is available on the PS website; however, there are several options that have not been released as they are still under consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074746">One of the options considered by the task force included the increased control of raw materials, including cigarette papers and acetate filter tow, which are used in the production of contraband tobacco products.  Upon further examination of the potential control of raw materials, the task force came to the conclusion that, with the exception of tobacco itself, there is no raw material that is exclusively used in the manufacture of contraband tobacco products.  For example, in addition to its application in contraband tobacco products, acetate filter tow is also used in the manufacture of gauze and feminine hygiene products.  As such, raw materials would be very difficult to regulate without causing a significant negative impact on the operations of legitimate businesses, particularly those not involved in the manufacture of tobacco products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074747">In response to (c), in July 2008, the Government of Canada joined with all provinces in a landmark settlement concerning tobacco smuggling which saw two major Canadian tobacco companies agree to pay $1.15 billion in fines.  As a result of this settlement, the Minister of National Revenue announced a $20 million investment to combat contraband tobacco and to reduce the amount of tobacco consumed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074748">As part of the $20 million  investment, the Government of Canada announced on May 28, 2010, several key initiatives that were developed by the task force to combat contraband tobacco:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074749">$7.41 million  for the establishment of an RCMP-led Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit--Contraband Tobacco Team, CFSEU-CTT, operating in Cornwall.  The CFSEU-CTT will target criminal networks engaged in the manufacture and distribution of contraband tobacco products, complementing the current enforcement efforts in that region;</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074750">$3.48 million  for the CBSA to establish a detector dog service focused on detecting and seizing contraband tobacco at marine ports of entry in Montreal and Vancouver, which are the regions with the highest rate of contraband tobacco activity; and</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074751">$4.97 million  for the Canada Revenue Agency to implement a multimedia awareness campaign,  comprised of television, print and radio ads, that will emphasize the link between buying contraband tobacco products and supporting the activities of organized crime groups.  The campaign will be deployed throughout Canada with a focus on Ontario and Quebec, provinces with high rates of contraband tobacco consumption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074752">It is clear that any enforcement, awareness and/or control mechanisms for contraband tobacco requires the continued cooperation and partnership between federal, provincial and territorial governments, first nations governments, the law enforcement community and industry stakeholders.

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="2074806">  Mr. Speaker, 
when a claimant qualifies for benefits, a benefit period of 52 weeks is established, which is the window of time within which all available benefits may be paid.  This applies to all benefit types, including regular, sickness, maternity, parental, and compassionate care.  The benefit period ensures that EI benefits are paid within a reasonable proximity relative to the earnings they are designed to replace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074807">The Employment Insurance Act,  EI Act, does provide for some exceptions when specific circumstances arise.  In particular, subject to eligibility requirements, 15 weeks of sickness benefits may be combined with 50 weeks of entitlement that maternity and parental provide, resulting in an extension of the 52-week benefit period to 67 weeks, including the two-week waiting period.  A claimant may receive sickness benefits before or after receiving maternity or parental benefits; however, the EI Act requires that to obtain an extension to the benefit period beyond 52 weeks, maternity, parental and sickness benefits must start during the original 52-week benefit period.  As such, in most cases where the claimant is expected to take the full 50-week combined maternity and parental benefits, sickness benefits must be received prior to maternity and parental benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074808">The provision for combining sickness benefits with maternity/parental benefits was originally included to address situations where women needed to leave work for health reasons prior to the birth of the child.  This was to ensure that they did not lose entitlement to parental benefits provided for parental bonding with a newborn child in its first year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074809">Claimants who have used their full 52 week benefit period before receiving any sickness benefits, are treated like any other EI claimant, and are not entitled to an extension.  No benefits are payable once the benefit period has ended and there are currently no provisions in the EI Act to extend a benefit period after it has ended, and their claim has terminated. This applies to claims for regular benefits and all types of special benefits.  Once a claim has terminated, an individual would require recent labour force attachment to re-qualify before they could again claim benefits.  In the case of sickness benefits, the individual would require an additional 600 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074810">Any proposed change to the administration of EI sickness benefits or the creation of any new program would require careful consideration as to the potential effects on other income supports and on employer-employee relationships.

              <ParaText id="2074830">  Mr. Speaker, the Commissioner of Lobbying has the authority to grant to designated public office holders an exemption from the five-year prohibition on lobbying the federal government after they leave office, if to do so is not contrary to the purposes of the Lobbying Act. The five-year prohibition and the authority of the commissioner to grant exemptions are set out in sections 10.11 and 10.12 of the Lobbying Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074831">The Lobbying Act requires that every exemption granted by the Commissioner of Lobbying be made public. As such, the names of all persons granted exemptions from the five-year prohibition and the reasons for the exemption are posted on the website of the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada at http://www.ocl-cal.gc.ca/eic/site/lobbyist-lobbyiste1.nsf/eng/h_nx00331.html. The Lobbying Act makes no provision for the publication of information regarding applications for exemptions that are not granted. As a federal government institution, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada applies the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act in responding to requests regarding exemptions that are not granted.

              <ParaText id="2074833">  Mr. Speaker, it is not possible to give a detailed response to each question for the following reasons: the confidential nature of the information, the terms of the court supervised settlement agreement, and the nature of how data is collected.  The following provides information on the settlement agreement and the administrator’s most recent update on the funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074834">On compassionate grounds, the federal government set aside $1.023 billion ($962 million for compensation, the balance for administration, legal fees and disbursements). Of the compensation amount, $93.1 million was designated for the Past Economic Loss and Dependants (PELD) fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074835">The Pre-86/Post-90 class action settlement is a court supervised administration.  The administrator, Crawford Class Action Services, was appointed by the courts, is supervised by the courts, and reports to the courts. The administrator is not permitted to release any information about the administration of the settlement unless authorized by the court. Authorized information about the status of claims is posted monthly on the administrator’s website:  http://www.pre86post90settlement.ca/index.htm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074836">Compensation to eligible class members is provided for both general and economic damages.  Payments to individual claimants will vary.The amounts paid reflect the disease state of class members at the time of their application, their age, any lost income, and the probability of disease progression. The agreement is designed so that those who are most sick and have suffered the most from their hepatitis C infection will receive the highest amounts of compensation, as was the case with the 1986-1990 agreement. Hepatitis C has varying effects on the human body, and the compensation plan is structured to reflect this fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074837">The agreement includes schedules for calculating the amount of compensation for infected persons, their estates, family members and dependants, both for general compensation and for past loss of income.  These documents are available on the administrator’s website under the heading Settlement Agreement--Appendices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074838">Persons infected with hepatitis C are entitled to general damages from under $10,000 to more than $400,000. The lowest amount of payment is for those who have essentially cleared hepatitis C from their blood, while the higher amounts are for those suffering from serious health effects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074839">Economic damages include payments for loss of income and services, uninsured medication and treatment costs, care costs and out-of-pocket expenses, compensation for funeral costs, and payments to estates and surviving family members.  Subject to certain provisions and limits, eligible class members are entitled to compensation for loss of income in an amount equal to 8/11ths of 70% of their past loss of net income, indexed to inflation, for each year until they attain the age of 65 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074840">The administrator’s most recent update, dated August 26, states that, as of mid-August, 15,584 claims have been received, of which 11,695 (75%) have been approved and 1,241 (8%) have been rejected, leaving 2,648 still being processed.  These figures concern the total number of claims and are not separated into compensation fund and PELD fund categories.  Of the $962 million set aside for compensation, $779,057,986 has been approved for payment, leaving approximately $183 million, not counting accrued interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074841">The amounts designated for the PELD fund and for the main compensation fund, as well as an estimate of the number of individuals who would be compensated, were the result of a complex negotiation process between a group of lawyers representing the class members and counsel for the government, based upon underlying estimates of class size provided by class counsel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074842">The settlement agreement was approved by the courts of the provinces where the class actions were filed.   

The settlement agreement contemplates that, if the take-up rate for claims to the PELD fund is high, the administrator may exhaust the original $93.1 million.  Therefore, the settlement contains a mechanism to top up the PELD fund if approved by the Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074843">It is the responsibility of class counsel, not of the administrator, nor of the government, to apply to the courts to transfer money from the compensation fund to the PELD fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074844">The settlement agreement sets out the requirements for the application, as well as the criteria the courts must consider in deciding whether to approve the request to transfer funds.  Class counsel must demonstrate to the courts, through actuarial evidence that will be reviewed by the government, that the compensation fund is sufficient to cover all the claims, as defined in the settlement agreement, prior to transferring funds to the PELD fund.  This process ensures that all claimants’ interests are protected and the federal government is following that process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074845">Class counsel have advised that work with their expert to conduct the necessary actuarial analysis has begun and they will be filing a motion for the transfer of funds in due course.

              <ParaText id="2074856">  Mr. Speaker, the government recently released the finalized version of the Code of Conduct for the Credit and Debit Card Industry in May 2010. For more information, please visit www.fin.gc.ca/n10/10-049-eng.asp.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074857">Businesses voiced real concerns about the lack of choice they have had in accepting debit and credit card payments, and about the costs involved. These added  business costs are borne by merchants and may be passed on to consumers, which makes this an issue of importance to all Canadians. The code of conduct encourages choice and competition. It gives merchants the freedom to choose which card networks they use, helps them control their costs, allows them to pass on savings to their customers, and much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074858">The government is particularly pleased that it was able to work constructively and cooperatively to launch this code with the financial service industry, consumer advocacy groups, retail /merchant advocacy groups, and other public interest groups. Prior to the release of the finalized code, the Minister of Finance met with a wide range of groups and organizations to discuss the state of the credit and debit card industry in Canada. Discussions focused on key issues such as transparency, disclosure, payment card branding and co-badging, as well as business practices in the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074859">Indeed, a draft code of conduct was released for a 60-day public comment period in November 2009. For more information, please visit www.fin.gc.ca/n08/09-109-eng.asp. During  that period, all Canadians were invited to submit their views on how best to monitor compliance with the proposed code. Their views were taken into account when developing the revised code of conduct, which was released in April 2010. For more information, please visit www.fin.gc.ca/n10/10-029-eng.asp, and the aforementioned finalized version in May 2010.</ParaText>

Canadian Federation of Independent Business, CFIB: “the[(CFIB] welcomes today's announcement … This Code, which very closely resembles the Code put forward by CFIB in mid-2009, will help increase transparency and restore fairness to small businesses and consumers in their credit and debit card transactions … Today's announcement of a finalized Code constitutes an important step and is timely as we enter the summer season that is so vital to so many businesses, especially coming out of a recession … These developments will create a better future for merchants and help ensure a fair and transparent credit and debit card market instead of just letting large industry players call all the shots. Our organization applauds the implementation of this Code which will provide merchants with greater clarity and clout in changes to the debit and credit card market.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074864">Option consommateurs: “enthusiastically welcomes … the new Code of Conduct for Debit and Credit Cards by the Minister of Finance. [The Finance Minister] has listened to consumers and incorporated their interests in this new code … The new code guarantees consumer choice.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074865">Consumers Association of Canada, “welcomed the Code.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074866">Interac Association: “After a comprehensive consultation period with stakeholders, the Minister has developed meaningful and practical solutions that will effectively address significant concerns that have been raised by merchants and consumers about changes taking place in Canada's debit marketplace … It is clear that (the Finance Minister) has heard the concerns of merchants and consumers, concerns that we share, and has responded with an appropriate and pragmatic Code of Conduct … Without question, the Code helps build that by re-establishing choice and transparency in the marketplace for merchants and consumers, which we support.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074867">TD Bank Financial: “We believe that this Code will give merchants a greater voice in the payments market, while also balancing the interests of the other participants in this industry.

              <ParaText id="2074869">Vancouver Sun editorial: “We were pleased to see the code of conduct for credit and debit card markets introduced this month by federal Finance Minister … the voluntary code is an important step toward allowing merchants to have some control over costs and to maintaining a relatively low-cost cashless purchasing alternative that benefits consumers and retailers alike while still allowing for competition between providers.”

              <ParaText id="2074871">  Mr. Speaker, it is inaccurate to say that Canada has refused to recognize the massacre at Srebrenica in 1995 as genocide.  Canada has consistently supported the work and findings of international judicial institutions in relation to the crimes committed at Srebrenica.  These include the decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY,  in Krstic (2001) and Popovic (2010) and the decision of the International Court of Justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro (2007), all of which held that the events that occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 constituted genocide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074888">  Mr. Speaker, Veterans Affairs Canada fully supports efforts to ensure that Veterans and their families have access and information to Veterans Affairs Canada’s programs, services, eligibility, and application processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074889">When the parliamentary committee report entitled “Shared Experiences: Comparisons of Veterans Services Offered by Members of the Commonwealth and the G8” was received by Veterans Affairs Canada, consultations were held with the Canada Revenue Agency.  These consultations resulted in Canada Revenue Agency’s confirmation that the focus of Canada Revenue Agency forms is on tax and benefit programs administered by the Canada Revenue Agency only.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074890">In response to (a), the criteria used in the decision not to pursue the inclusion of a veteran identifier on tax forms were: privacy, legal authority, effectiveness, and sustainable development commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074891">In response to (b), he inclusion of non-tax questions, or requests for information not related to benefits administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, may result in breaches of privacy.  Veterans Affairs Canada offers many services and benefits to veterans which are based on various eligibility criteria.  While some benefits, including war veterans allowance and earnings loss benefits, are dependent upon an individual’s income, there are other eligibility criteria for these programs which would not be captured on tax forms, and are still required by Veterans Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074892">The majority of Veterans Affairs Canada benefits are not dependent upon income.  To collect information about individuals where it is not required for an operational program may be a breach of the individual’s privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074893">In addition, the increase of information in Canada Revenue Agency forms and guides may result in larger documents, which run contrary to the paper burden reduction initiative, and other sustainable development commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074894">The identification of an individual as a veteran and information about income levels is not sufficient to meet the eligibility criteria for Veterans Affairs Canada programs and services.  The Canada Revenue Agency web site currently links to the Veterans Affairs Canada web site to facilitate information sharing on benefits and services offered by Veterans Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074895">In response to (c), the identification alone of a veteran to Veterans Affairs Canada does not automatically result in the veteran’s eligibility for Veterans Affairs Canada programs and services.  The department has outreach activities to provide information to Canadian Forces members, veterans and their families about the services and benefits available from the department.  The outreach describes eligibility to all programs and services including the New Veterans Charter programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074896">This outreach is accomplished in various ways including the distribution of printed materials, the publication of articles in periodicals, Veterans Affairs Canada’s own Salute! newsletter, briefings with Canadian Forces members, veterans, family members, and the general public.  Outreach also includes the use of social networking sites on the internet, and Veterans Affairs Canada staff co-located with the Department of National Defence case managers on major bases in integrated personnel support units.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074897">The department also partners with veterans organizations and other groups to provide information to individuals about benefits and application processes.  An expanded outreach on the New Veterans Charter programs is currently under way.

 on May 12, 2010, CBSA officials met with representatives of the Association des plaisanciers du Québec, CONAN (amateur builders and navigators), Gosselin Marina, and a member of the public.  They discussed the options examined to address the issues at the Quai Richelieu, related primarily to docking certain boats in high winds.  In the short term, the CBSA has implemented appropriate measures to address the public and employee safety issues: boaters will no longer have to dock in high wind conditions.  If necessary, CBSA officers will examine boats and their passengers at nearby marinas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074900">In response to (b)(i)(ii)(iii), CBSA and Public Works and Government Service Canada are undertaking a wind and water current study to formulate an acceptable, complete and permanent solution to address the risk related to boat damage, the safety of boaters and employees that may be caused by the Quai Richelieu.  The final report will formulate recommendations for the possible installation of a pontoon to facilitate docking, with or without a breakwater, and other measures that may be necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074901">In response to (c),  the plan is to implement a final, complete and permanent solution prior to the 2011 boating season.

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="2074903">  Mr. Speaker, in response to (a), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, CFIA, has not specifically tracked the number of inspectors who ensure compliance to Part XII of the Health of Animals Regulations. Many CFIA inspectors are cross-utilized in other programs. This includes inspectors that work in animal health and for this reason it is not possible to identify the exact numbers of inspectors dedicated to ensuring compliance to the Health of Animals Regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074904">In response to (b), there may be some variation in position titles across the country for inspectors who carry out animal transportation inspections.  However, the vast majority of these inspectors hold the following titles: Animal Health Inspector, Veterinarian, District Veterinarian, Meat Hygiene Inspector and Veterinarian-in-Charge.

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074905">n response to (c), as previously described, the titles may vary among regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074906">

In response to (d), the activities required to inspect animal transportation may be carried out under a variety of position titles and by inspection staff cross-utilized in other programs, depending on regional resources, industry demographics and operational requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074907">In response to (e), in consultation with stakeholders, the CFIA has been examining possible enhancements to the Health of Animals Regulations,  specifically Part XII which is related to the humane transportation of animals. The stakeholder input received to date, which includes response from a wide range of producer organizations, processors, transporters, animal welfare organizations, and the general public, indicates that there is agreement that the regulations should be reviewed and updated to reflect modern industry transportation standards and practices, as well as current scientific knowledge about animal transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074908">The CFIA has been analyzing the input received and recent scientific research to determine what improvements could be proposed. It is therefore anticipated that a proposed regulatory amendment will be
published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, for public comment.

              <ParaText id="2074939">  Mr. Speaker, in response to (a), from 2003 to present, the only published study with a specific focus on aircraft noise, was a review of the scientific literature on aircraft noise-induced sleep disturbance. This was published as a peer reviewed journal article in 2007.  In this review, it was found that people living around airports show disturbed sleep in the form of awakenings and increased body movement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074940">Aircraft noise is one reason, but it is responsible for less sleep disturbance than spontaneous awakenings and other indoor noise events.

Aircraft noise appeared in a very preliminary field study conducted by Health Canada from November 2006 to February 2007, designed to examine possible relationships between noise annoyance and stress. This was presented only in a poster at a 2007 University of Ottawa   fourth year honours thesis symposium. Where exposure to aircraft noise occurred, the number of subjects was too small to obtain reliable conclusions about any possible relationships between stress hormone responses and annoyance level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074941">Aircraft noise annoyance was also used as an example in a 2008 peer reviewed journal article which provided an analysis of how noise annoyance can be used as a health impact in environmental assessments. In the review of the scientific literature on noise annoyance in this study, it was found that there was some evidence to suggest an association between road traffic and neighbourhood noise levels and some stress related adverse effects, e.g., hypertension and migraines. It was also found that on average a given long term exposure to aircraft noise makes a greater percentage of a population highly annoyed than would road traffic noise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074942">Health Canada has also published a total of three laboratory studies on the potential for noise-induced stress in either rats (two studies, one published in 2003 and the other in 2005) or people (one published in 2006) using noise sources other than aircraft noise. In the 2006 publication of the laboratory study where people were exposed to noise, it was found that the exposure of people to noise events during sleep did not appear to create a stress response. It was also inconclusive as to whether there were adverse effects on their sleep. The laboratory studies of rats showed inconsistent stress responses to noise, indicating that assessing the biological plausibility of noise-induced stress in humans from animal studies appears to require further investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074943">In response to (b),  advice Health Canada has provided to Transport Canada – the department, as a member of Transport Canada’s Domestic Aircraft Noise and Emissions Committee, D-ANEC, has provided advice on a number of occasions since 2003. Health Canada specialists have contributed information about the health effects of noise in discussions at D-ANEC meetings and to requests for input, outside of meetings, on D-ANEC issues. Examples include (i) the proposed changes to the Transport Canada document TP 1247--Aviation--Land Use in the Vicinity of Airports--Part IV Aircraft Noise and (ii) the use of chapter 2 jet aircraft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074944">Departmental scientists publish peer-reviewed journal articles related to the health effects of aircraft noise, and ensure that the Committee is made aware of these documents e.g., the two major reviews on noise-induced sleep disturbance and noise annoyance, published in 2007 and 2008, respectively and described in the answer to part (a) above.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074945">A 2003 summary analysis of annoyance and sleep disturbance health effects from aircraft noise in the vicinity of airports was sent to Transport Canada regional staff that is responsible for Toronto--Lester B. Pearson International Airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074946">In response to (c) (i),  the department has no record of having provided specialist information directly to Montréal-- Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport since 2003.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074947">In response to (c) (ii),   the department provides advice, on request, to responsible authorities (federal authorities specified in regulation) designated under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, for airport projects regarding the health effects of noise. This advice is not provided directly to the airport authorities but to the responsible authorities under the act. Comments were provided on the health impacts for several environmental assessments for airport projects since 2003 such as: Jean Lesage International Airport in Quebec City in 2006, a ground transportation infrastructure project concerning Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport from 2004 to 2006 and a runway extension at the Kamloops airport in 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074948">There is only one record of having provided specialist information directly to an airport in Canada since 2003. Health Canada provided publicly available information to a consulting firm engaged by the Calgary Airport Authority in September 2009; specifically, the 2008 review on noise annoyance as a health impact for use in environmental assessments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074949">In response to (d),  an update for the It’s Your Health relevant to aircraft noise is intended for the fall of 2010.

              <ParaText id="2074953">  Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court of Canada, in its decision dated December 11, 2008, declared that EI premiums for the years 2002, 2003 and 2005 were collected unlawfully.  In its decision, the court found that EI premiums for those years did not constitute a regulatory charge but rather represented a payroll tax.  Since no delegation of taxing authority was provided for in the legislation, the premiums constituted an unlawful tax.  The court suspended the declaration for one year in order to give the government time to rectify the invalidity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074954">Through sections 227 and 228 of the Budget Implementation Act, 2009, which came into force on 
March 12, 2009, Parliament set the premium rates for 2002, 2003, and 2005.  This responded to the Supreme Court’s decision and provided authority for the collection of premiums for those years, rectifying the invalidity.

Automation, process re-design and changes in government policy and priorities all have the potential both to increase and to decrease the nature and volume of work and the number of employees required in specific locations throughout the country.  Service Canada delivers fifteen national specialty programs and services in Acadie-Bathurst, drawing on a mix of indeterminate, term and casual employees.

              <ParaText id="2074958">  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the Canadian Tourism Commission, CTC, during the 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 fiscal years, in response to (a),  the CTC is a partnership-based national marketing organization.  As such, expenditures amounts for marketing and communications services include partnership contributions specific to partnership agreements.  Due to limitations on the information that can be retrieved from information systems, the CTC cannot provide the level of detail requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074959">In response to (b), the CTC has engaged in domestic marketing for 2009 and 2010 only.  Budget 2009, Canada’s Economic Action Plan, included $20 million for the CTC over two years for domestic marketing to stimulate Canada’s tourism industry.  The CTC’s Locals Know campaign, aimed at encouraging Canadians to explore Canada, is in its second and final year.  Marketing content for this campaign was media-based, including national television, national newspapers and magazines.  For regional media buys, all provinces, territories and regions of Canada had the opportunity to buy-in, and some provinces did participate in this campaign.  As in response to part (a), records include partnership contributions and, given limitations on the information that can be retrieved from information systems, it is not possible to extract the exact amount spent by the CTC on advertising in each province, territory or region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074960">In response to (c),  in March 2007, the CTC launched a two-phase competition for a full range of marketing communications services.   The bid documents stipulated that the successful firm must be able to provide and manage all services through its corporate entities or approved affiliates.  The opportunity was posted on MERX in both French and

    …  Fifty-seven firms requested the bid documents: nine firms submitted proposals, five formally declined and the remaining 43 did not respond.  Of the nine responses, three were found to be inadequate for further consideration.  The four top-rated firms were invited to make presentations to an evaluation panel that included CTC marketing specialists, legal and financial advisors, as well as an independent industry expert.  Throughout each step, the firms and their proposals were evaluated against published criteria.  Following the final assessment and a period of due diligence, the panel recommended that a contract be awarded to DDB Canada, the top-rated firm.  On November 7, 2007, a contract was issued to DDB Canada for a period of four years with a one-year renewal option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074961">In response to (d), the contract with DDB Canada does not stipulate an amount nor does it stipulate a commitment to a minimum annual value.  The contract stipulates a fee structure, hourly rates, terms of service and a process for planning, estimating and pre-approving all work.  The amount that the CTC spends with DDB Canada and its affiliated agencies is limited by the annual budgets established and approved by CTC executives.  As noted in part (a), the CTC is a partnership-based organization.  Its systems identify payments made to DDB Canada, but these payments also include partnership contributions toward services rendered by DDB Canada.  To break down these payments based on CTC contributions versus partnership contributions would necessitate a review of each partnership agreement and would take much longer than the time allotted to respond to this question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074962">In response to (e), this is confidential third-party information pursuant to section 20(1) of the Access to Information Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074963">In response to (f), for the period in question, the CTC has not purchased advertising in official language minority newspapers.  For the Locals Know campaign, however, the CTC purchased media buys in French and English national newspapers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074964">Note that for statutory reporting purposes, the CTC’s fiscal year is January 1 to December 31.  The CTC’s response, therefore, is based on its fiscal years ending December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2009.

The PFP will be modeled on the PFP offered by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, and would apply to public hearing processes for major energy projects. Detailed PFP eligibility and application guidelines will be posted on the NEB website following necessary approvals. The NEB considers environmental matters in all of its decisions regarding energy facilities.  Most of those decisions also trigger a federal environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, CEAA, and the NEB ensures that a federal EA is conducted according to the CEAA.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074980">Mr. Speaker, in response to (a), while there is some industry interest in future development of airships capable of transporting more than nine passengers, no application has been made to Transport Canada for such an aircraft, nor has any specific future application been identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074981">In response to (b), the existing design requirements for airships are detailed in Airworthiness Manual 541, and existing manufacturing requirements and operating rules are stipulated in Canadian Aviation Regulation (CAR) 561.  There is currently no plan to further review requirements for airship design, operation or maintenance, as the department has not been approached by the industry to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074982">In response to (c), the Canadian Aviation Regulation 421.25 details the licensing requirements for balloon pilots, which are also applicable to airship pilots.  The licensing requirements stipulate a pilot’s minimum age, medical fitness, knowledge, experience and skill.  The Canadian Aviation Regulation 421.40 details the licensing requirements for proof of experience and skill to obtain an airship or powered balloon endorsement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074983">In response (d), the Canadian Aviation Regulations provide the regulatory requirements for the construction, operation and maintenance of all aerodromes, as opposed to requirements for aerodromes that will specifically be used by airships.  The Canadian Aviation Regulation subpart 301 contains the regulatory requirements for the operation of all aerodromes and the Canadian Aviation Regulation subpart 302 contains the regulatory requirements for the operation of airports, also known as certified aerodromes.  Where an airship is used at an airport, or certified aerodrome, particular attention must be paid to the requirements for obstacle limitation surfaces, OLS, around the airport, as the airship itself could become an obstacle depending on its parking position.  In the event that the OLS are jeopardized, operational restrictions or changes to the level of service of a particular runway may be implemented to satisfy the regulatory requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074984">In response to (e), requirements for airships are already addressed by Transport Canada’s existing regulations, as explained in parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2074987">  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the Nanisivik Naval Facility is to have an upgraded berthing capability with a modern fuel farm and a small administrative, services and utilities building. In November 2009, a design contract for just under $900,000 was awarded to WorleyParsons Westmar Limited from North Vancouver, British Columbia. This is the first of the project’s four design phases. The initial design phase is complete and phase two will be awarded shortly. Phase two will provide a recommended option that will lay the foundation for the remaining design phases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074988">In addition to design work, detailed studies such as geotechnical investigations, wharf structural inspection, topographical and environmental assessment will be required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2074989">It is anticipated that major construction work at the Nanisivik Naval Facility could begin in 2012, once all the necessary assessments are completed, approvals are in place and clean up of the former facility is finished or sufficiently completed in order to have access to the site. Completion of the Nanisivik Naval Facility is scheduled for 2015.

              <ParaText id="2074993">  Mr. Speaker, 


In response to (a), KAIROS was recently refused funding as it was determined that KAIROS’ 2009 program proposal did not meet the government's priorities. 

Unlike many other NGOs making proposals to CIDA, KAIROS is a coalition of several member organizations, some of which continue to receive separate funding from CIDA.

KAIROS submitted a new proposal in April 2010, which is now undergoing CIDA’s standard evaluation process.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2075142">More than 350 organizations and expert panels have decried the consequences of the government's decision to get rid of the mandatory long-form census.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075144">Last week even the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, said that scrapping the long form census could hurt the bank's data on important issues affecting the economy, like productivity, labour data and household economies, all of which are vital markers for assessing the strength of our economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075145">This House cannot fulfill its mandate without the data collected on the long-form census, without knowing who our citizens are, where they live and what types of situations they are in.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075146">Government departments, from Health Canada to Veterans Affairs, rely on census data, and without the long-form census they will not be able to deliver on their responsibilities to Canadians or answer the questions that Canadians or members of Parliament have about the important issues facing us. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075148">I have spoken with our members about the practical implications of this matter, and I will give one example. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> told me that it was not a question of going in and finding out what goes on in people's bedrooms. Rather, it is a question of finding out how many bedrooms there are compared with how many children there are. We know that there is an overcrowding problem resulting from the crisis of affordable housing in this country. Members who question whether this is true should visit any remote first nations community, where three or four families, 15 or 16 people, sometimes live in houses built by the federal government for only one family. These members will then see what I mean. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075149">Maybe the government does not want to know about rising inequality in our society and its impacts; maybe it prefers not to have the information. But that does not make it right. In fact, this is very shortsighted policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075150">If we do not act immediately, and I have to speak to the timeliness of this issue, there will be irreversible damage to Canada's vital statistical resources, because the information collected in this census will not be comparable with information from past census processes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075161">Mr. Speaker, the question was whether our opposition to Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> and some of the arguments I made against it were timely, in light of some of the historical abuses of human rights and civil liberties that we have seen in this country. That is an interesting question. What have we learned from our mistakes in the past? The suggestion is that mistakes made in the past will not be repeated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075162">When we look at the number of times we have made the same mistake in the past, usually in a crisis, we see that sometimes governments panic and attack certain members of their society by undermining fundamental rights. That is what this bill would do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075163">One of the other parts of the question, to be a bit more timely, was whether we can we rely on our courts to protect our fundamental rights. In this country, we have a division of authority, and courts certainly have a role to play in protecting our rights by interpreting the Constitution and the Charter of Rights. However, they also have, as I think our Conservative colleagues rarely will acknowledge, a deep respect for the role that we as parliamentarians play in passing laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075164">We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to protect fundamental rights. We are not doing that by this legislation. Nor is there any reason to believe that our courts will find, as they have for part of this legislation, that it is within the Charter of Rights. That is not the end of it. We still have a responsibility to deal with this as parliamentarians. They have a responsibility not to interfere other than in the most exigent circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075165">I have at times been critical of our judiciary. When we look at the process of security certifications that has been gone through in the last seven or eight years, we see that any number of times we have had interpretations, particularly from the federal court, in which they did not at the time protect fundamental rights. They have begun to do so. They began in 2006 or 2007. There were several years in which those certificates were used improperly, and our courts finally got around to realizing that. So we cannot rely exclusively on our courts to protect fundamental rights. We have to assume our responsibility, and supporting this legislation would not do that. This should be opposed. We should be striking this bill off our agenda. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075166">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on Bill C-17. This key piece of anti-terrorism legislation seeks to re-enact, but with more safeguards, the provisions having to do with investigative hearing and recognizance with conditions, which we lost because of a sunset clause in March 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075167">The powers set out in the bill attempt to fill a gap in our national security law. Effectively they focus much of their attention on the prevention of a terrorist offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075168">I think all members of the House can agree that unlike some other forms of criminality a terrorist who is able to carry out an offence is attempting to injure and kill large numbers of people, making prevention an even more crucial policy goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075169">This point, that there is a qualitative difference between terrorism offences and other regular forms of criminal activity, has been made by a number of terrorism experts. In this regard the members of the House may wish to recall the testimony of Lord Carlile of Berriew, the United Kingdom's independent reviewer of its anti-terrorism legislation, before the House of Commons subcommittee that reviewed the anti-terrorism act in November 2005. Lord Carlile was asked whether there was really any difference between investigating terrorism and investigating organized crime. She replied:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075170">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">If I can I'll just characterize one important difference between terrorist crime and normal organized crime, or what police in Northern Ireland call ODCs, or ordinary decent criminals, in a distinction that they make. With organized crime, it is often possible for the police investigating that crime to leave arrest until very late. Indeed, for example, there was a huge robbery at London Heathrow Airport a couple of years ago—I was involved in the case for a time professionally—in which they allowed the robbery to take place, and they arrested the robbers whilst they were committing the robbery, with the result that in the end most of them pleaded guilty. You can't run that risk with terrorism.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075171">To summarize this relatively short bill, the proposed investigative hearing provisions would create a mechanism for questioning persons before a judge about a past or future terrorist offence. The proposed provision for recognizance with conditions would allow a judge to impose reasonable conditions on a person in order to prevent the commission of a terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075172">Surprisingly, some have maintained that the provisions are not necessary. Various reasons have been advanced in this regard. I would like to use my time to address some of these arguments, as I think it is important to have an informed debate on these matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075173">Some say that since the provisions have never been used they must not be a truly necessary law enforcement tool. I cannot disagree more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075174">This view is based exclusively on hindsight and not on foresight. In the policing world, which I know very well as a member of the Winnipeg Police Service on a leave of absence, foresight is crucial, as is pro-activity. One could just as logically claim that because to date one's house has not burned down or one has never before become seriously ill that there is no need ever to buy fire or life insurance. Given the existence of an ongoing terrorist threat, reliance on past experience alone is an insufficient guarantor of the future security of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075175">Another view advanced has been that the recognizance-with-conditions provision is unnecessary because other Criminal Code provisions could be used instead. This view fails to appreciate the purpose of the recognizance-with-conditions provision. This tool is designed to disrupt the planning of terrorist activity at a very early stage. I will give an example. Suppose the police receive intelligence that a foreign head of state visiting Canada will be the target of a terrorist attack. They may therefore have reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorist act will be committed, but they may not have reasonable grounds to believe that a particular person will be the one to carry out the attack, which is the standard required under our existing arrest laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075176">As a result, the person could not be arrested for conspiracy or under subsection 495.(1) of the Criminal Code. Similarly paragraph 810.01(1) would not apply, because it is targeted, in part, at those who it is reasonably feared will engage in a terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075177">Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> seeks to fill this gap by authorizing a peace officer to lay an information before a judge if he or she believes on reasonable grounds that a terrorist activity will be carried out and suspects on reasonable grounds that the imposition of a recognizance with conditions on a person, with the arrest of the person, is necessary to prevent the carrying out of a terrorist act.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075178">Some have also put forward the position that Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> infringes upon human rights. In rebutting this view, let me begin with the investigative hearing provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075179">In the debates on this bill's predecessor, former Bill <Document DbId="3735387" Type="3">C-19</Document>, the argument was made that this hearing was an infringement on the right to silence. The answer to this argument was authoritatively given by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004 in a case called “Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code”, which arose in the context of the Air India prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075180"> The majority of the court rejected the appellant's argument that the investigative hearing violated an individual's absolute right to silence and the right against self-incrimination, noting in part the specific and robust protections governing use and derivative use immunity found in the original legislation. Indeed, the court noted:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075181">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Derivative use immunity is provided for in s. 83.28(10)(b). Indeed, the protection in para. (b) goes beyond the requirements in the jurisprudence, and provides absolute derivative use immunity, such that evidence derived from the evidence provided at the judicial investigative hearing may not be presented in evidence against the witness in another prosecution even if the Crown is able to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it would have inevitably discovered the same evidence through alternative means. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075182">We all need to keep in mind when thinking about possible adverse ramifications of the recognizance with conditions that they have a built-in legal filter. They can only be imposed when two criteria are met: A peace officer must believe on reasonable grounds that a terrorist activity will be committed, and must suspect on reasonable grounds that the imposition of the recognizance is necessary to prevent the carrying out of the terrorist activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075183">Moreover, the second criterion is not one of mere suspicion, it is one of reasonable grounds to suspect. In other words, this is a higher bar. This means more than a mere hunch. In this regard, I would note that the concept of reasonable suspicion is not unknown in Canadian criminal law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075184">By analogy, I note that the Supreme Court approved the standard of reasonable suspicion in the context of the common law police power of investigative detention, the police power to briefly detain a person where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect the person has committed a crime. In this regard, I refer hon. members who are interested to the case of Regina v. Mann.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075185">Therefore, I think it is fair to say that this will not be applied to a broad range of people in this country. With regard to the view that these powers can unfairly label a person a terrorist without the opportunity to clear oneself, I would call attention to the well-established and often-used peace bonds or recognizance powers in the Criminal Code. In particular, a peace bond could be imposed to prevent a person from inflicting injury on or committing a sexual offence against a young person. These, too, have implications for the defendants who are subject to them, but no one would argue that because of this these provisions should not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075186">Like these existing provisions, the proposed recognizance with conditions is carefully tailored to achieve an overarching critical objective, namely the prevention of a terrorist activity, an objective that I know all members support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075187">Another criticism of this bill, in its previous incarnation as Bill <Document DbId="3735387" Type="3">C-19</Document>, was made by the hon. NDP member for St. John's East. It went as far as, in effect, something like this:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075188">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When a bill allows for imprisonment for up to 12 months or strict recognizance conditions on individuals who have not been charged with any crime, it is contrary to the core values of our justice system. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075189">I disagree, and I am going to prove that point immediately. I would point out that this accusation of fundamental unfairness cannot only be made of the recognizance with conditions provision found in this bill, it can also be equally made of all the peace bond provisions of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075190">Please allow me to set out for consideration and reflection by the hon. members the following peace bond provisions that contain this very same power to order up to 12 months' imprisonment where a person refuses to enter into recognizance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075191"> The first is a recognizance where a person fears on reasonable grounds that another person will cause serious injury to him or her or to his or her spouse or common-law partner or child, or will damage his or her property, under paragraph 810(3)(b) of the Code. Other examples are a recognizance where a person feels on reasonable grounds that another person will commit a terrorism offence or a criminal organization offence, under subsection 810.01(4); a recognizance where a person feels on reasonable grounds that another person will commit one of various sexual offences in respect of a person under 16 years of age, found under subsection 810.1(3.1); or a recognizance where a person feels on reasonable grounds that another person will commit a serious personal injury offence, which is found under subsection 810.2(4).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075192">In all these instances, if a person refuses to enter into a recognizance, the power to order up to 12 months imprisonment exists. My point is that the punishment provision for refusing to enter into a recognizance is not unique to the recognizance with conditions provision found in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>. It is standard for all peace bond provisions in the Code. It is therefore a good reason to ensure that there is a means whereby a person's refusal to enter into a peace bond has consequences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075193">Indeed, I would point out that the recognizance with conditions provision found in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> is, in one important respect, more limited in scope than some other peace bond provision found in the Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075194">Hon. members may recall that where there is a reasonable fear that another person may commit a sexual offence against a person under 16 years of age or that another person may commit a serious personal injury offence, the recognizance can actually be extended from 12 months to two years if the person has been previously convicted of a similar offence. In contrast, in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> the maximum period of time that a recognizance can be enforced is in fact 12 months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075195">Changing gears a little bit, I want to discuss briefly some of the policy decisions that went into the development of the bill. Members may recall that the House of Commons subcommittee interim report on the Anti-terrorism Act, the legislation that originally contained both of these schemes, recommended limiting the investigative hearing power to the investigation of imminent terrorism offences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075196">The government has, for good reason, decided not to go this route. If this limit were imposed, it would exclude the possibility of holding an investigative hearing in respect of past terrorism offences. For example, if this recommendation were to be accepted and if a terrorist group committed an offence and planned a subsequent offence, or offences, in the investigative hearing no questions could be asked about the offence already committed, even though such questioning could yield information that would be essential to the prevention of the planned subsequent offences. It is clear that this decision makes good policy sense and serves to better protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075197">Another criticism that may be raised is that the bill does not totally reflect the judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada with regard to the investigative hearing provisions. As hon. members may recall, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004 rendered two decisions with regard to the investigative hearing. In one case, the Supreme Court held that the investigative hearing should presumptively be an open hearing, albeit this is a presumption that could be rebutted, depending on the facts of the case; and in the other, which I have already referred to, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the investigative hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075198">However, as part of its latter judgment, the Supreme Court extended the protection of use and derivative use immunity beyond the criminal proceeding context to cover extradition and deportation hearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075199">In my view, it is unnecessary for Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> to explicitly propose an amendment to extend the use of derivative use provision to extradition and deportation hearings or to include a provision about the presumption of openness in such cases. It is obvious to me that, if enacted, Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> will be interpreted in light of the Supreme Court's conclusion on these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075200">I have attempted to address some of the objections to the bill that have been raised in previous discussions. I hope that some of the reasons I have articulated will have resonated with my colleagues in this place and that they begin to view these provisions as minimally intrusive and ones that do not present a threat to the Canadian values but actually protect them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075201">I want to reiterate that we have heard from police officers as well on this issue. I myself was a police officer when the sunset clause took away these powers, and I am here to say that I represent many police officers across this country who believe this is essential to prevent any kind of terrorism attacks in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075203">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her comments, especially as they come from a former member of our national police force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075204">When this legislation was introduced, it was created in an obviously different context from where we are right now. Soon after 9/11, many countries tried to shore up certain aspects of their security laws. This was Canada's effort. The government of the day included a sunset clause because it was understood at the time that in such a heated environment sometimes governments will make decisions and changes to laws that they do not necessarily want to have in permanent effect. It is a temporary measure for extreme circumstances. We are now at the sunset clause of this legislation again where it is up for renewal or dismissal, depending on whether it has been useful or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075205">This government and the one before have prosecuted cases around homegrown terrorism without using any of these requirements. We actually heard from witnesses at the committee on the provisions in this bill. We understand that the provisions border on the draconian at times, forcing a witness to testify against his or her own interests. This is one of the foundations of our justice system and it is removed through this bill. Holding people without charge is also against the very foundations of what parliaments have stood for, for many years. So know that the measures are serious, and I think the hon. member appreciates that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075206">These are not light uses in this legislation, but we have never had to use them, even in prosecuting criminal charges of homegrown terrorism. So in the balance that we try to establish here in Parliament as legislators, between the rights of individuals and the protection of society, suspending a person's ability to testify against themselves, suspending the rights of people who are then held without charge, for a piece of legislation that does not get used even when we prosecute in criminal cases involving terrorism, does it not seem to the hon. member that we should allow the sunset to finally take place on this legislation? It was drawn up in a different context, and it has not been applied. Even in moments when we have needed to apply the force of the law and all our security details to terrorism, we have not used this. Is it worth the continued sacrifice to have, on the books in our Parliament and our land, laws that so override basic fundamental human rights, for a law that we simply have not used?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075207">Madam Speaker, I welcome the opposition member back to the House after the break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075208">I am glad that the hon. member has asked that question. There are a couple of elements in the question that I would like to explain so that he really understands how imperative this is to law enforcement and to this country as a whole. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075209">First and foremost, the hon. member mentioned that it has not been used. Yes, I agree that it has not been used, but that does not mean that we will not need to use it in the future. We have seen an escalation of arrests in terrorists activities or suspected terrorist activities. As a police officer who is on a leave of absence and I have every intention to return to my position as a police officer when I am done helping to create some new laws here in the House, I know this is a tool that will be used when appropriate. When the hon. member mentions that it has not been used yet, that clearly indicates to me that it is used only when it is absolutely necessary. The officers I have spoken with indicate that they believe this is a tool they will unfortunately have to use in the future, and I would like to give them every tool open to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075210">I too am concerned always about the safety and security of Canadians. That is why I think this bill must be adopted, because without this bill, we cannot proactively deal with terrorism. This bill also allows us not only to deal with future terrorists acts, but past terrorists acts, and that is crucial during investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075211">So I would urge the member to consider that this bill is the answer to both protecting Canadians securely and providing for their rights. This is only going to be used in very serious cases, and I would urge the member to consider that and vote with us to ensure the safety and protection of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075219">Madam Speaker, I am trying to follow my colleague's logic in that the utility of this bill is to protect Canadians and keep them safe, but it has not been applied. There has been testimony from many who work around this specific type of law, which is very particular, that already in the legal definitions in Canada there is the power to do things to prevent terrorism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075220">In the draconian measures that we are talking about, anecdotal officers talking to me does not cut it. We need legal experts to come forward and say the law is deficient to protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075221">In the terrorism cases we have prosecuted in this country, if this law were so important, it certainly would have been applied. If this were the critical piece of legislation that was missing prior to 9/11 and the government came up with this and said this is what we need to keep Canadians safe, it would have been used in cases of homegrown terrorism, clearly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075222">The draconian nature of this is that in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> somebody can be held without charge for up to a year, no charges whatsoever. Never does the evidence come before the person who is being held in custody. This should concern all of us. I cast no aspersions on the government, but this law enables this or any future government to simply hold any Canadian for up to a year without presenting a single charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075223">We must, as legislators, contemplate the future. We must contemplate bad government always, misinformed government, racist government, governments under some sort of pressure.

              <ParaText id="2075225">In saying that, the member speaks about putting people in a custody situation and how wrong that seems. I will tell the member what is wrong.

I was a member of the committee that studied the bill introduced in the House of Commons by the Liberal government at the time, a bill that specifically included these two clauses, the two provisions that the Conservative government would like to re-introduce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075230">I would say to all those listening at present that most members at the time were very concerned by the drastic measures affecting people's basic rights.

              <ParaText id="2075231">In response to these concerns, the government of the day brought forward what is known as a sunset clause to ensure that the House would retain responsibility and monitor the government bill to prevent any abuse.</ParaText>

I find it interesting that these provisions died several years ago under the current government.

The government did not move second reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075236">Then, after the 2008 election, what happened? The government came back with the identical bill, moved first reading, it went on to the order paper, and then it just sat there.</ParaText>

Canadians have to understand that. It is up to the government to move second reading of its own bills. No other party can do that. No other member of Parliament can do that. Only the government can move second reading of its own bills and allow the debate to begin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075238">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, said this is so important, to use the words of the member from Manitoba, that we absolutely need these two provisions to be brought back to life. Law enforcement, anecdotally from what I hear from the member from Manitoba because she did not cite any studies, have said that, “Some members of law enforcement have told me that we are going to need these provisions at some time in the future. Even though we have not used them in the last nine years, at some time in the future we will need them and so, it is urgent that we revive these two provisions, bring them back to life and it has to be done now”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075239">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued the House. He put a padlock on Parliament. He shut it down.

              <ParaText id="2075240">Then when we came back from prorogation, all of the parties agreed, including the official opposition, the Liberal Party of Canada, with the government that we would forgo certain time off that had been built into the parliamentary schedule, that we would work those weeks instead, in hopes that the government was going to put forward the bills that it found to be a priority.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075242"> I am not putting into doubt that member's good faith, but I find it a bit rich to listen to her talk about how her government is concerned about victims of terrorism, that the government is concerned about victims of crime here in Canada, and that the government is the only government that is really for law and order and for ensuring that the proper laws are in place. That is a government, going on to its fifth year now, that has played games with Canadian lives. It has used the issue of law and order to try to gain some kind of partisanship advantage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075249">A colleague from the NDP, I believe, made the point that the provisions of the Criminal Code used for every single individual charged with terrorism in Canada, homegrown terrorism, as some people refer to it, were not the provisions under the Anti-terrorism Act. </ParaText>

If the government sincerely believes that these two provisions are needed, would it please make the case, based not on anecdotal reports but on actual studies that have been done, on empirical studies, on evidence-based studies, and on actual fact?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075251"> Any one of us sitting here can come up with anecdotes. That is not governing. That is not a competent government. A competent government bases its policies—and policy legislation is government policy—on fact, on empirical evidence, and on scientific evidence, not on anecdote. It does not do it by saying, “It is my opinion, and therefore that goes, and that is good enough, because it is my opinion,” or ”It is my opinion, on which I have done absolutely no research and have nothing to base it on except gut feeling and perhaps emotion”. That is supposedly a basis from which to govern and enact new legislation and policy. It is not. No responsible government does that. A responsible government actually gathers the facts, goes and talks to people who have made it their life's work to know all the ins and outs of the issue and have the expertise to provide solid, sound advice that is based on fact.</ParaText>

Do not base it on some whim or on gaining partisan advantage and maybe destroying one politician and getting a gain for another politician and gaining a few more ridings and a few more seats. None of it is based on fact. None of it is based on competency. It is based on whipping up a motion.</ParaText>

The hon. member is making a very valid point. We need to make sure, as elected members of Parliament in a democratic nation, that we are making decisions on critical law and policy based on evidence and not on fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075260">We have the responsibility, as elected officials, to make sure that we govern in a cogent, informed way. I would ask the member how members of her party can bring themselves to consider supporting the bill? It languished for four years. The government with its fighting-hard-against-crime agenda has simply not given prominence to the bill. There have been a number of actions brought against alleged terrorists in this country, and at no time was this law utilized. Where is the evidence? Where is the sound rationale for bringing this law forward?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075261">I am concerned that surely, in a country that is run by the rule of law and democratic foundations, would the elected officials ever support a law that would take away the fundamental right to remain silent, the right to not self-incriminate, the right to know the charges, and the right not to be interrogated or imprisoned without knowing the charges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075263">Madam Speaker, I would like to point out that the legislation and these provisions were actually enacted, as I stated quite openly and freely, by a Liberal government back in 2001. I was one of the members of Parliament at the time who sat on the committee reviewing the Anti-terrorism Act and therefore had a certain amount of impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075264">I take note of the point that the member made, which I as well attempted to make, and that is a responsible and competent government does not govern or enact policies out of fear. I believe she would understand that there was a great deal of fear back in 2001, but calm heads did prevail and made the point that these were draconian measures, that we were not satisfied that the case had been made that they would ultimately be required, that our existing Criminal Code and laws would not be sufficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075265">As a result of that, the Liberal government listened. It listened to the experts, to the members of the House of Commons, who had these concerns and preoccupations, and agreed to put a sunset clause in the bill. The sunset clause was over five years later. If the government did not re-enact it, the provisions automatically died, and they died under the Conservative government. That government said that it was important to revive these provisions, knowing full well they had never been used. However, it has never provided, as my colleague said, any cogent evidence to support its claim that these provisions are absolutely needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075266">The member asks how my party can support this. My party is a responsible party. We have heard experts in the past, some who have said the provisions may be needed, others who have said they may not be needed. We would like the debate to continue on this. The only way for it to continue and to hear from all stakeholders, including individuals who may have been targeted by the existing and still active provisions of the anti-terrorism bill, is to come before the House of Commons to speak of their experiences and give us the evidence either in favour of or opposed to so each individual elected to the House can make a cogent choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075267">I have no shame in saying that my party has decided it will allow this to go to committee. It does not mean that we are in support of the provisions being re-enacted. We want to hear what the stakeholders and experts have to say because the government certainly has not made a case for it yet.</ParaText>

It does not appear to be a government that governs based on actual fact and scientific studies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075278">One only has to look at its decision with regard to the census.

I am pleased to take part in the debate at second reading of Bill C-17, which would restore the Criminal Code provisions pertaining to investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions that were created by the Anti-terrorism Act of 2001.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075283">Unfortunately, these important anti-terrorism tools ceased to be in effect in March 2007 under a sunset clause. The investigative hearing provisions gave judges the power, on application by a peace officer and with prior authorization of the Attorney General, to compel an individual to appear before the court to answer questions about past or future terrorism offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075284">The provision on recognizance with conditions gave judges the power to impose reasonable conditions to prevent terrorist acts from being carried out if certain criteria were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075285">In the aftermath of September 11, Canada was certainly not the only democratic country in the world to have legislated new powers in order to prevent terrorist acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075286">In creating the Anti-terrorism Act in 2001, Parliament duly took into account the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That is why, compared to those of other democratic countries, our provisions on investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions stand out by guaranteeing the protection of basic human rights. Those same guarantees can also be found in the provisions presented here today, and still others have been added.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075287">In comparing the measures taken in Canada and those taken by other parliamentary democracies, it is quite clear that Canada took a moderate approach and fully considered basic rights and freedoms, values that are at the very core of our Canadian identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075288">First, regarding the investigative hearing provisions set out in the bill, let us begin by looking at what some other countries, specifically the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, have done in that regard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075289">In the United Kingdom, the closest thing to the investigative power may be the Terrorism Act 2006. That act is based on previous legislation on organized crime and enables an investigative authority, such as the director of public prosecutions, to require a person to provide documents, answer questions and provide information relevant to the investigation of a terrorism offence. Generally speaking, no judicial authorization is necessary, which is what makes that legislation very different from Bill C-17.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075290">The United Kingdom has other legislation that goes further than investigation before a judge. The Terrorism Act 2000 was amended in 2001 to create the offence of refusal by a person to disclose to police, as soon as reasonably possible, information they know or believe to know that could be used to help prevent the perpetration of a terrorist act by another person. It applies if the person knows or if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that the police are investigating a case involving terrorism or are planning to do so. The proposed sentence is a maximum of five years in prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075291">Bill C-17 does not include a similar power. I repeat; it does not include a similar power. According to a recent article, in Great Britain—we are familiar with the events—27 charges were laid for that offence between 2001 and 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075292"> Under the United States' long-standing grand jury procedure, a federal grand jury can subpoena any person to testify under oath, subject to claims of privilege. Anyone who obstructs a grand jury risks being held in contempt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075293">Australia has specific procedures similar to the Canadian investigative hearing. The Australian equivalent is covered in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075294"> This legislation allows the ASIO, after being authorized by the Attorney General, to ask an independent authority—a federal magistrate—to issue a warrant to question individuals for the purposes of a terrorism investigation. A warrant may also be issued in some cases to authorize the detention of a person for the purpose of questioning. A person may be detained for the purpose of questioning for up to a maximum of 168 hours. The questioning carried out under a questioning warrant or a questioning and detention warrant must be done in the presence of a prescribed authority, generally a retired judge, according to the terms set out by that authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075295"> The Australian law prevents the individual from contacting a lawyer of his choice in some cases, for example, when the prescribed authority is satisfied, on the basis of circumstances relating to that lawyer, that if the individual is permitted to contact the lawyer, a person involved in a terrorism offence may be alerted that the offence is being investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075296"> Furthermore, if the person specified in the warrant, or his lawyer, directly or indirectly discloses operational information as a result of the issue of a warrant or the doing of anything authorized by the warrant, while a warrant is in force, or in the two years following the expiry of a warrant, this constitutes an offence punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment. In such a case, strict liability applies to this offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075297">As we can see, by proposing the investigative measures provided for in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, Canada is not an odd man out among other democracies, a number of which are among our closest allies. However, it is important to note that by creating the legal obligation to disclose information that could help a terrorism investigation and making the failure to do so a criminal offence, the United Kingdom goes much further than Bill C-17.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075298">Let us look at how the parts of the bill that deal with recognizance with conditions compare to the legislation passed by other countries, starting with the United Kingdom. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075299"> Pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000, a constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist. All that is needed is reasonable suspicion. The maximum period of pre-charge detention is 28 days. The British government has tried unsuccessfully to increase this to 42 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075300">Furthermore, in 2005, the United Kingdom created a system of control orders that apply to citizens and non-citizens alike. There are two kinds of control orders: derogating and non-derogating control orders. The first are those that derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights, and the second are those that contain obligations that respect the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075301">Basically, the home secretary—I am still talking about the UK—can apply to a court to impose obligations on an individual where there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities and this measure is considered necessary in order to protect the public from terrorism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075302">The duration of the orders varies depending on the kind of control orders imposed by the court. Non-derogating control orders are enforced for a maximum of 12 months while derogating control orders are enforced for up to 6 months. They can be renewed under certain conditions. As of September 10, 2010—so just recently—there were nine control orders in effect, all concerning British citizens. None of the orders derogated from the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075303">This system of control orders has been very controversial. The House of Lords ruled that imposing a curfew of 18 hours a day violated the right to liberty guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075304">Another House of Lords later concluded that a person subject to a control order must be provided with sufficient information about the allegations against them to be able to give meaningful instructions to the special advocate concerning these allegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075305">Although critics have questioned the validity of the control order system, Lord Carlile of Berriew, the independent reviewer of Britain's anti-terrorism legislation, concluded that this system is still valid. In his February 2010 report on control orders in the United Kingdom, Lord Carlile concluded that abandoning the control orders system would have a damaging effect on national security and that there is no better means of dealing with the serious and continuing risk posed by some individuals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075306">However, I would like to inform my hon. colleagues that the new coalition government—that is, the coalition government in England—is currently studying anti-terrorism measures. The study will focus on control orders as well as pre-charge detention of suspected terrorists, including reducing the maximum detention period of 28 days. The study findings are to be reported to Parliament this fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075307">In addition, I would like to mention that the <I>Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 </I> contains a provision whereby someone convicted of a terrorism-related offence can be required, once out of prison, to periodically provide police with certain information such as their name, home address and any changes to this information. The person subject to this requirement can also be subject to a foreign travel restriction order, which limits their movements outside the United Kingdom in order to participate in another terrorist act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075308">I would like to add that Australia has also adopted a control order system. Upon request, a court can place obligations upon a person if, on the balance of probabilities, it is satisfied that the control order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist attack, or that the subject provided training to or received training from a terrorist organization In general, a control order is valid for up to 12 months. We know that two control orders have been issued since the system was put in place. These orders are no longer valid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075309">Furthermore, the governments of Australia and its states authorize the preventive arrest of terrorist suspects. Under that system, the Australian federal police, in the case of an actual or imminent act of terrorism, may ask the judge to order the preventive arrest of a suspect for a maximum period of 48 hours. In Australia, states and territories allow for preventive detention for up to 14 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075310">Therefore, how do these international measures compare with the proposals outlined in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, the bill currently before the House? The provision for recognizance with conditions requires that there be reasonable grounds to believe or suspect. In addition, the intent of this provision is not to arrest people but to detain suspects in order to prevent a potential terrorist attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075311">Similarly, although the provision provides for arrest without a warrant, it is very narrow in scope, as in an emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075312">In summary, it is fair to say that the measures of other countries are similar to and sometimes go further than those proposed by this bill. For example, an overview of the differences between Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia indicates that Canada, unlike the United Kingdom, does not have a maximum detention of 28 days prior to charges being laid. Unlike the United Kingdom and Australia, Canada does not have a system of restrictive measures. However, in contrast to the United Kingdom, Canada does not criminalize the failure to provide a peace officer with information pertinent to a terrorist offence. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075313">Unlike Australia, we do not restrict the selection of lawyers for the investigation and unlike the United Kingdom, Canada does not impose the requirement to report or travel restrictions on persons found guilty of terrorist acts, as we saw previously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075314">I have attempted to prove that, like other democratic nations, Canada has recognized the need to provide for additional powers in order to investigate or prevent terrorism. It is a very unique crime that requires unprecedented solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075315">The honourable members should be reassured by the fact that the provisions of the bill include abundant guarantees and are narrow in scope when compared to measures adopted by other parliamentary democracies, such as the United Kingdom. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075316">By re-establishing the powers provided for by Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, Canada can prove that it can play a leadership role and is taking steps to fight terrorism, all the while respecting human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075317">Consequently, I am asking for the speedy passage of this very useful bill to combat terrorism. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128173" Type="2">Mr. Michel Guimond (Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075318">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on my party's behalf about Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (investigative hearing and recognizance with conditions).</Document></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075319">I must reiterate that the Bloc Québécois is opposed in principle to Bill C-17. The Bloc Québécois has what I feel is a responsible, logical process for analyzing such measures. Any measure that deals with terrorism must strike a balance between security and respect for basic rights. Therein lies the problem because the dichotomy makes this bill ambiguous. We have to ask ourselves this question. Yes, it goes without saying that we must keep people safe. We were reminded of that just last week during memorial ceremonies at Ground Zero in New York. Although it happened nine years ago, we cannot forget the terrorist attacks or those who lost their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075320">People deserve reassurance. We have to keep people safe. However, a wrong-headed government or one acting in bad faith could use the security imperative as an excuse to investigate, conduct searches or imprison any person who seems suspicious based on very subjective criteria. That is why we have charters to guarantee respect for basic rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075321">The Bloc Québécois recognizes that both imperatives have to be respected and taken into account. We know what the Conservatives have shown us since coming to power and even before then, when they were in the opposition. I have been here since 1993, and we have seen their reform agenda. Let us not forget that the Conservative Party used to be the Reform Party. The Conservatives do not like to be reminded of that fact. Then they became the Canadian Alliance, and now they are the Conservative Party. Let us not forget, however, that the old reform base is still very much alive for many Conservative members. Still, I know that some of them have a more progressive approach. I would not want to generalize and be accused of demagoguery. We have to recognize the progressive elements in the party, and during face-to-face discussions, we can see that some of the party members do not share the party's ultraconservative views.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075322">With this in mind, the Bloc Québécois became very involved in the review process of the Anti-terrorism Act and its operation, a review which is provided for in the act itself. As the previous speaker mentioned, under the sunset clauses, we must now proceed with this review again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075323">The Bloc Québécois has taken time to examine the issue thoroughly. I said earlier that the Bloc Québécois is opposed to this bill in principle. That idea did not just come to us out of nowhere. Opposing this principle was not a decision that just popped up like a jack-in-the-box.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075324">From December 2004 to March 2007, the Bloc Québécois listened to witnesses, read submissions and interviewed experts, community representatives and law enforcement officials. We conducted a comprehensive analysis with those concerned by the application of this legislation. It is all well and fine to adopt an inapplicable or utopian law, but we have to realize that law enforcement representatives, especially those working on cases involving terrorism, have to enforce that law and apply it day by day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075325"> During the Subcommittee on the Review of the Anti-terrorism Act's specific study of two provisions in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, the Bloc Québécois made its position on investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075326">The Bloc Québécois felt that the investigative process needed to be better defined. We still feel that way today. In our opinion, it is clear that this exceptional measure should be used only in specific cases in which it is necessary to prevent activities where there is imminent peril of serious damage, and not in the case of misdeeds already committed. The nuance is important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075327">However, we were strongly opposed to clause 83.3, which deals with recognizance with conditions. Not only do we feel that this measure is of little, if any, use in the fight against terrorism but, more importantly, there is also a very real danger of its being used against honest citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075328">The Bloc Québécois finds that a terrorist activity deemed dangerous can be disrupted just as effectively, and in fact more effectively, by the regular application of the Criminal Code, without the harmful consequences that a preventive arrest can trigger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075329">Therefore, we recommended abolishing this approach, and we won our point on February 27, 2007. Today, our position has not changed. On the one hand, the investigative process should not be reinstated unless major changes are made to it, which is not the case with Bill C-17. The government would have had the opportunity to do so with the introduction of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075330">On the other hand, preventive arrests have no place in the Canadian justice system, given their possible consequences and the fact that other provisions which are already in place are just as effective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075331">Of course, in the time I am allotted, I could speak more about the technicalities, but I would like to close by focusing on the fact that law enforcement officers are telling us that they can still use other provisions of the Criminal Code to arrest someone who is about to commit a criminal offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075332">A criminal offence would also include a terrorist act. I think our police officers are competent. They are professionals who keep the peace and protect the safety of our constituents. There is no doubt about that. The Conservative government does not have a monopoly on discipline and law and order.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075333">The Conservative Party is in no position to lecture anyone. Those best suited to enforce the Criminal Code are our peace officers and various levels of police, be they municipal other otherwise. In Quebec, we have the Sûreté du Québec, which is the envy of many police forces across the country and around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075334">The structure of the Sûreté du Québec and the professionalism of its members are often envied by other countries. And foreign delegations often come to study the Quebec police system, which is a credit to us, I believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075335">I mentioned earlier that police can use the Criminal Code to make an arrest. For example, paragraph 495(1)(a) of the Criminal Code states the following:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075338">The officer has the discretionary authority and does not need to wait for a criminal offence to have been committed before intervening. Criminals have even gone to court saying that it was unfair that when they were preparing to rob a bank that the police waited on the corner for them to leave their car, about to rob the bank, before they intervened. That argument has actually been used in court, which is ludicrous. And unfortunately, there are lawyers that have defended such cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075339">In other words, just because an officer is hiding does not mean that he cannot intervene. Rather, the officer plays a preventive role. He does not need to wait for something bad to happen. He is supposed to chase thieves, but he must also prevent criminal acts from happening. And this is why we feel that Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> is completely useless. We do not need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075340">This bill, if adopted as is, could be used to label an individual as a terrorist based on flimsy evidence. In this regard, I spoke earlier of the erosion of fundamental rights and freedoms. We could compare this situation to that of Maher Arar upon his return from Syria, before he was exonerated by Justice O'Connor. Maher Arar's case is the most blatant example of a person who was judged according to completely subjective criteria, requiring Justice O'Connor's inquiry to exonerate him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075341">If this new, temporary provision of the Criminal Code had been used, a judicial decision could have imposed conditions based on the fear of terrorist activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075342">That is what I wanted to say to my colleagues in the House and to the people watching us on television. I stand by what I said: the Bloc Québécois is opposed to the principles of the bill. I am well aware that the Conservatives react whenever we oppose one of their bills to amend the justice system and undermine the fundamental rights of citizens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075343">I will just make my prediction now, not because I have looked into a crystal ball but because, as usual, we know how the Conservatives operate. If the opposition does not like this bill and is opposed to the bill, they will say that the Bloc Québécois supports terrorists. I am saying it and we are about to hear it. Madam Speaker, just sit there until the end of the debate, read the papers tomorrow, and you will see the headline, the Bloc Québécois supports terrorists. It is like the time we were told that the Bloc Québécois supports pedophiles. Conservative demagogues said those things. Most of us are parents; some of us are grandparents. They said that the Bloc Québécois protects pedophiles rather than children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075344">This summer, I promised myself that I would not get angry. However, I am getting angry again because I am thinking about that. Yesterday, I spent the day with my two and a half year old grandson. Being told that we protect pedophiles is no laughing matter. That is Conservative-style demagoguery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075345">I am eager for an election so we can unmask the Conservative demagogues opposite.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075347">This piece of legislation points to the continuing erosion of democratic rights and civil liberty rights under the current Conservative government.

              <ParaText id="2075348">The member mentioned Maher Arar and of course that was an absolute travesty of justice when the government did not step up to protect his rights. The current legislation shows a lack of balance between security and fundamental rights. In fact, this piece of legislation would allow for imprisonment of up to 12 months or for the imposition of strict recognizance conditions on individuals who have not been charged with any crime. Could the member comment on this continuing erosion which Canadians consider to be pretty fundamental to who we are as Canadians in terms of civil liberties and our values of justice?</ParaText>

It is clear that Republicans are gurus to our colleagues across the way, that the Conservatives draw their inspiration from the George W. Bush years. The approach in those days was repressive rather than preventive. That is the difference. This was never more apparent than during the G20 summit, when over a thousand arrests were made in Toronto this summer. More than 1,000 people were denied their individual freedoms. These people only wanted to demonstrate, not necessarily to use violence, but to express their discontent with the influential people of this world who meet to make decisions on our behalf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075350">These people only wanted to demonstrate. Some 1,000 people were sent to jail when the City of Toronto adopted a bylaw that made a mockery of all individual freedoms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075351">The Conservatives' approach and their bills do not make sense and this permeates through other levels. The Toronto city council adopted bylaws that completely tore up certain charters, swept aside the right to demonstrate and the right to oppose decisions that might be made during the G20. More than 1,000 people were unjustly put in jail. I remind my colleague that most of those people were Quebeckers.</ParaText>

The Bloc Québécois did so in response to the murder of young Daniel Desrochers in the riding represented by my former colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, Réal Ménard, who is now mayor of the borough of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

Our honest producers were truly being terrorized. They were being threatened and traps were set in their fields. The Bloc Québécois worked hard on that issue, especially our colleague Yvan Loubier, who was the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075365">Another example comes to mind, that is, the reverse onus in the case of individuals living off the proceeds of crime, when proceeds of crime are found in their homes. That is another file that the Bloc Québécois pushed ahead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075367">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the second reading debate in relation to Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075368"> It is perhaps timely that this debate begins only days after the only man convicted in the Air India bombing, Inderjit Singh Reyat, was found guilty of committing perjury during the 2003 trial of Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik, who were ultimately acquitted of criminal charges arising from the Air India bombing. It is a sober reminder that terrorism has caused the death of hundreds of Canadians. Let us not forget the tragic total resulting from that mass murder, 329 passengers and crew, when Air India flight 182 was blown up in mid-flight, and two baggage handlers were killed at Tokyo's Narita Airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075369">The hon. members of this House may recall that in November 2005, the Subcommittee on Public Safety and National Security of the Standing Committee on Justice, Human Rights, Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness heard testimony from Maureen Basnicki, whose husband died at the World Trade Centre on 9/11, and from Mr. Bal Gupta, chair of the Air India Victims Families' Association. Their testimony was given as part of the parliamentary review of the Anti-terrorism Act. In his testimony, Mr. Gupta read into the record the following recommendations:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Anti-terrorism Act should not be repealed or softened, and its provisions should be strengthened by closing loopholes...There will be more legal tools to compel witnesses to testify in terrorism-related cases.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075371">At that time, the two powers that Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> proposes to reinstate, the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions, were part of the Anti-terrorism Act. They had yet to sunset. Later, according to newspaper reports, Mr. Gupta supported extending the life of these tools when Parliament was debating whether to extend them or to have them sunset in early 2007. As members know, they did sunset in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075372">The Air India tragedy and the events of 9/11 remind us that when enacting anti-terrorism legislation for combating terrorism in a manner that has due regard for fundamental human rights, we must consider not only the rights and freedoms of those that may be accused of terrorism, but also the tragic human cost to terrorism itself, not only the deaths of or harm done to the victims, but also the harm done to their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075373">I recently came across a study written by Professor Craig Forcese, which included the following quote from Mr. Justice Laws of the English Court of Appeal. It eloquently describes the difficult task facing legislators in this area. It is a long quote, but an important one, so I hope members will please bear with me. He wrote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075374">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This grave and present threat [of terrorism] cannot be neutralised by the processes of investigation and trial pursuant to the general criminal law. The reach of those processes is marked by what can be proved beyond reasonable doubt...In these circumstances the state faces a dilemma. If it limits the means by which the citizens are protected against the threat of terrorist outrage to the ordinary measures of the criminal law, it leaves a yawning gap. It exposes its people to the possibility of indiscriminate murder committed by extremists who for want of evidence could not be brought to book in the criminal courts. But if it fills the gap by confining them without trial it affronts “the most fundamental and probably the oldest, most hardly won and the most universally recognised of human rights”: freedom from executive detention.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075375"> In light of these concerns, it is appropriate that any proposal to reinstate the powers of the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions should be subjected to rigorous review. It is right and proper that this bill should now be reviewed by this Parliament. In doing so, however, I would remind hon. members that this bill does not appear out of the blue. It is a culmination of efforts by previous Parliaments to seek to improve this legislation, including the parliamentary committees that reviewed the Anti-terrorism Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075376">Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> was carefully drafted to respond to many of the recommendations made by both the Senate and the House of Commons committees that reviewed the Anti-terrorism Act. Not all recommendations were accepted but many were. In addition, a previous version of the Bill, Bill <Document DbId="3082346" Type="3">S-3</Document>, was reviewed by the Senate special committee on anti-terrorism, and as a result, further amendments were made. These are all incorporated into Bill C-17.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075377">Further, I would add, there has also been a judicial review by the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court of Canada, of one of the two key tools found in this bill, the investigative hearing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075378">I wish to address much of the remainder of this speech to a number of criticisms made in the investigative hearing during that legal challenge and the court's response to them. Hopefully, this will give all hon. members a better understanding of the complex issues raised by this tool and how it was fashioned in a manner to protect fundamental human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075379">Perhaps the major argument against the investigative hearing was that it denied a person the right to silence and/or the right of self-incrimination. However, the court rejected this argument. After examining the robust protection against self-incrimination found in the then existing legislation, the court noted:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075380">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the procedural protections available to the appellant in relation to the judicial investigative hearing are equal to and, in the case of derivative use immunity, greater than the protections afforded to witnesses compelled to testify in other proceedings, such as criminal trials, preliminary inquiries or commission hearings.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075381">As well, in order to prevent possible future abuse, the court expanded the use and derivative use immunity protections beyond the scope of criminal proceedings to include deportation and extradition proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075382">Another major argument was that the investigative hearing compromised the independence of the judiciary because it co-opted the judiciary into performing executive investigatory functions in place of its usual adjudicative role. However, the majority of the Supreme Court rejected this claim, arguing that:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075383">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The function of the judge in a judicial investigative hearing is not to act as “an agent of the state”, but rather, to protect the integrity of the investigation and, in particular, the interests of the named person vis-à-vis the state.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075384">Another argument made was that the independence of Crown counsel was compromised because the Crown counsel's role became impermissibly intertwined with the police task of investigation. Again, the Supreme Court rejected this argument, pointing out that, in part:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075385">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--one may assume that by bringing Crown counsel into the judicial investigative hearing process, the legislature intended that the Crown would conduct itself according to its proper role as an officer of the court and its duty of impartiality in the public interest...The mere fact of their involvement in the investigation need not compromise Crown counsel’s objectivity, as the critical component is their own “necessary vigilance”--</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075386">Another argument was that the investigative hearing in the court challenge was that the judicial investigative hearing in the circumstances of this case served the improper purpose of obtaining pretrial discovery for the Air India trial. However, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada rejected this argument, agreeing with the trial judge that its purpose had been predominantly investigative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075387">As well, in a companion case issued the same day, the Supreme Court held that the open court principle applies to an investigative hearing. It held that while the application for an investigative hearing should not be held in public, akin to the application for a search warrant where it comes to the investigative hearing itself, there should be a presumption of openness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075388">In reaching this conclusion, the court adapted the Dagenais/Mentuck test which had been developed in case law in relation to publication bans to the investigative hearing. The court acknowledged, however, that there could be circumstances where the presumption could be rebutted. It stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075389">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It may very well be that by necessity large parts of judicial investigative hearings will be held in secret. It may also very well be that the very existence of these hearings will at times have to be kept secret. It is too early to determine, in reality, how many hearings will be resorted to and what form they will take. This is an entirely novel procedure, and this is the first case — to our knowledge — in which it has been used.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075390">To summarize, Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> builds upon the original provisions governing the investigative hearing. It builds upon them by adding additional safeguards, but the foundation remains the same. This foundation was examined by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004 and was upheld to be constitutional. In our future deliberations about this bill, we should not forget that the investigative hearing has already passed the test of compliance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075391">Let me now proceed to the recognizance with conditions provision. Unlike the investigative hearing provision, the recognizance with conditions power created in 2001 by the Anti-terrorism Act was never tested in the courts. However, it is based on the peace bond provisions found in other parts of the Criminal Code, albeit with modifications so that it can be used to disrupt nascent terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075392">It is particularly with regard to the recognizance with conditions that the quotation from Lord Justice Laws that I used at the beginning of my speech is apt. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075393">This is because it can be used in circumstances where the information obtained by the police gives rise to a reasonable belief that a terrorist activity will be committed, where there is insufficient information that could allow the police to arrest the person for involvement in a terrorism offence, but there are reasonable grounds to suspect that it is necessary to impose a recognizance with conditions on the person to prevent the carrying out of the terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075394">Some have argued that this is too great an extension of the criminal law power. Let regular police powers apply, they argue, in which case they mean that the police already have the power to arrest someone who they believe on reasonable grounds is about to commit an indictable offence. However, the difficulty with this proposal is that it would severely restrict the ability of the state to prevent terrorism because it requires an “about to commit test” which reports the concept of imminent harm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075395">In contrast, the recognizance with conditions provisions found in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> increases the ability of the state to take preventative measures to protect persons from terrorism, but it does so, in my mind, in a way that is consistent with the rule of law. Hence the need for a two-pronged test to be satisfied: a reasonable grounds to belief test, and a reasonable grounds to suspect test. Reasonable suspicion alone is not enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075396">Moreover, I also point out that important accountability mechanisms are built into the provisions of this bill. Some of these are carried forward from the original legislation. First and foremost, the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions would be subject to a sunset clause which would result in their expiry after five years unless renewed by parliamentary resolution. As well, there would be annual reporting requirements by the federal government and the provinces on the use of these provisions. Although, in the case of the federal government, there would be an expanded reporting requirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075397">In addition, these provisions would not be able to be used unless the consent of the appropriate attorney general is first obtained. This is true even in the case of a person who is arrested without warrant under the recognizance with conditions tool. While the peace officer in such a case would be able to arrest the person to bring the individual before a judge, he or she would still have to obtain the consent of the appropriate attorney general in order to lay any information before such a judge. This is a condition that must be satisfied before a hearing can take place to decide if a recognizance should be imposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075398">Also provided for in the bill is a provision inserted by the Senate when it was reviewing a previous version of Bill S-3. Parliament must review these provisions prior to the date that they sunset. As part of this review process Parliament would be able to examine the degree to which these provisions had been used, successfully or unsuccessfully, and would be able to make a determination based on the available evidence as to whether or not these provisions would continue to be needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075399"> I believe all of us in this House believe that terrorism should be combated. For those who believe that the existing criminal law is sufficient to combat terrorism, I respectfully disagree. I believe events both outside and inside Canada, such as the recent convictions in the Toronto 18 case and the recent arrests in Toronto, show that the threat of terrorism is an ongoing concern and that there is a need for the tools of the investigative hearing and the recognizance with conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075400">However, I also recognize that in order to combat terrorism successfully these measures must be crafted so as to ensure adequate protection of fundamental rights. By examining the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in relation to the investigative hearing, I hope I have dispelled the concerns that it violates fundamental human rights and basic notions of fairness. Indeed, I would ask all hon. members to reflect on the fact that Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> improves upon the safeguards found in the original legislation. I urge all members to support the passage of this bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075401">Madam Speaker, I listened very attentively to the parliamentary secretary give the reasons for reintroducing a bill that expired years ago. As the member knows, the original provisions were brought into the House but they were not used and Parliament chose not to renew them. Yet the government is choosing at this time to bring this bill forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075402">The member has already made the case of those who have been raising a contrary point of view on this, that the recent arrests and some investigations have been done with existing Criminal Code provisions. What is very clear is that the underfunding by the government of our police forces, something that has an impact in a whole variety of areas, and the breaking of promises around funding for RCMP, is something that would do a lot more to address concerns generally than the provisions in the bill that, as has already been noted, were not used and expired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075403">I can only wonder why the government is bringing the bill forward at this time. It does not seem to make sense except when we look at the summer the government has had. The Conservatives made appalling, inappropriate decisions around the census. They have had boondoggles around the untendered nature of the billion dollar jet fighters, around the fake lake and the billion dollar cost of the summit and the $130 million paid out to Abitibibowater basically because Abitibibowater was upset. All of these boondoogles, moneys paid out, have turned the tide of public opinion against the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075404"> It seems to me that what we are seeing today is a government that is so desperate that it wants to try to revive fear by throwing together legislation that was not used in the past and was not renewed by Parliament rather than dealing with the real issues about which Canadians are talking. Is that not the real reason why the government is bringing this forward today?</ParaText>

Our law enforcement officials are telling us that these provisions are necessary to keep Canadians safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075406">While it appears that no investigative hearing had been held or recognizance with conditions imposed before the previous provisions expired, this should not suggest, in my opinion, that they are not important or not needed in the future. We should take comfort in the fact that based on past experiences with previous provisions, law enforcement officials and prosecutors have demonstrated caution and restraint with respect to the use of these provisions. Moreover, law enforcement agencies have expressed their support for the continuation of these previous provisions.</ParaText>

The bill, which has never been used and which has languished for four years, is supposedly an incredibly important law. There have been concerns with terrorism and security around the world for quite some time, including in our country. Therefore, I concur with my colleague who earlier asked why now. How would the bill ensure that the rights of all Canadians to be treated fairly before the law are protected, that they have a right to remain silent, that they have a right against self-incrimination, that they have the right to know the charges against them and the right to be charged before they are incarcerated? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075421">The Supreme Court of Canada made it very clear that the powers in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17 </Document> are constitutional and protect fundamental rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. For example, the power with respect to investigative hearings has a number of safeguards, including that only a judge of the provincial court or a superior court of criminal jurisdiction can hear a peace officer's application for an investigative hearing and the prior consent of the <Affiliation DbId="105825" Type="21">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> or solicitor general of a province will be needed before a peace officer can apply for an investigative hearing order. In addition, there will have to be reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorism offence has or will be committed. In addition, the judge will have to be satisfied that reasonable attempts have been made to obtain the information by other means for both future and past terrorism offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075422">The nature of these terrorism offences is such that the peace officers often do not know exactly when the terrorism incident will take place, but they have evidence to suggest that people are plotting the terrorism incidents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075423">On this side of the House we believe we cannot put the safety of the people of Canada at risk waiting for that time when the peace officer is going to say that the bomb is about the explode in a few minutes or an hour from now and then go to the court. We need to be able to act quickly and prevent that from happening to keep people safe in Canada. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128375" Type="2">Mr. Ed Fast (Abbotsford, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075424">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand today in support of Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>. It is a bill that seeks to reinstate the investigative hearing and recognizance provisions that were created in the Criminal Code by the Anti-terrorism Act in 2001. That was in the wake of 9/11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075425">The investigative hearing provisions gave a judge the power, on application by a peace officer and with the prior approval of the attorney general, to compel a person to attend at court to be asked questions about a past or future terrorism offence. The recognizance provision gave a judge the power when certain criteria were met to impose reasonable conditions on a person to prevent the carrying out of a terrorist activity. I think all of us in the House would support that as a laudable goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075426">Unfortunately these important tools in the fight against terrorism expired in March 2007 because of the operation of what is called a sunset clause. The bill being debated today would re-enact these important provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075427">I would first like to discuss how the recognizance portions of the bill compare with the legislation of other countries. Other countries have been the subject of terrorist acts as well. Canada's major terrorist act, of course, was the Air India disaster, a sad story and chapter in the history of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075428">When we look to the United Kingdom, we see that its terrorism act allows a constable to arrest, without warrant, a person whom he reasonably suspects to be terrorist. The maximum period of detention for which a person can be detained under this power before being charged is 28 days. Efforts by the United Kingdom to extend this period to a longer period of 42 days were unsuccessful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075429"> Further, since 2005, the U.K. has created a system of what it calls controlled orders that can apply to British citizens as well as to non-citizens. There are two kinds of control orders that can be imposed, derogating and non-derogating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075430">Derogating control orders are those that specifically derogate from the human rights guarantees which are found in the European Convention on Human Rights, while the non-derogating control orders contain obligations that are meant to comply with that convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075431">Basically the U.K. Home Secretary can apply to a court to impose obligations on an individual where there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity and it is considered necessary in order to protect the public from terrorism to impose obligations and conditions on this individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075432">The length of time that a control order is in force varies depending on the type of control order that the courts impose. A non-derogating control order expires after 12 months, while a derogating control order, because it is more severe, expires after 6 months. They can be renewed under certain conditions. As of September 10, there had been nine control orders in force, all of which were in respect of British citizens. All of these control orders were non-derogating, in other words the less severe kind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075433">Moreover, I would note that under the counter-terrorism act, 2008, there exists a power in the U.K. to impose on a person who has been convicted of a terrorism offence the requirement to notify the police periodically of certain information after being released from prison, things such as identity, place of residence and future changes to those items. As well, a person subject to this notification requirement can also be made subject to a “foreign travel restriction order” to prevent the person from travelling outside the U.K. to take part in terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075434">In the United Kingdom, governments have already taken the threat of terrorism very seriously. They have not left it to the previous criminal code to protect them. They have gone beyond it to ensure their citizens are protected. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075435">In Australia, something very similar has been done. It also has control orders. On application, a court may impose obligations on a person if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that making the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act or that the person has provided training to or received training from a listed terrorist organization. Generally, a control order in Australia may last for up to 12 months and our understanding is that two control orders were issued since the creation of that legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075436">The Australian national government and the state governments also allow for preventive detention of terrorist suspects. Again, that is reasonable. The threat of terrorism around the world is not abating so the Australian government recognized that and provided for preventive detention. Under its scheme, the Australian federal police may apply to a judge for an order allowing up to 48 hours of preventive detention of a terrorist suspect where there has been a terrorist act or where a terrorist act is imminent. The preventive detention in Australian states and territories is up to 14 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075437">When we compare the experience of the U.K. and Australia to Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> that is before us, the recognizance provisions of the bill are reasonable and require that there be reasonable grounds to suspect and reasonable grounds to believe that a terrorist act will be committed. Moreover, the purpose of the recognizance with conditions provision is not to arrest a person but to put a suspected person under judicial supervision in an effort to prevent the carrying out of a terrorist activity. Again, reasonable and I believe most Canadian would share that sentiment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075438">Also, while there is an arrest without warrant power under the recognizance provisions being proposed, it is extremely limited in scope. We are trying to balance the individual rights of Canadians against the very real and urgent threat of terrorism and that terrorism presents to our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075439">In summary, it is fair to say that the measures elsewhere are akin to and, in some cases, far surpass the measures proposed in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075440">With regard to the investigative hearing provisions of the bill, I would again like the House to consider what other countries, most notably Australia and the U.K., have done in these areas. For example, in Australia there are specific procedures generally similar to the Canadian investigative hearing. For example, Australia's equivalent is found in the Australian security intelligence organization act. Under that act,the security intelligence organization with the attorney general's consent can seek a warrant from an independent issuing authority, usually a federal magistrate or judge, for the questioning of persons for the purpose of investigating terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075441">A warrant may also be obtained that authorizes the detention of a person for questioning in certain limited circumstances. A person who is held in detention for the purpose of questioning can be held for up to a maximum of 168 hours. Any questioning must be undertaken in the presence of a prescribed authority, generally a retired judge, and under conditions determined by that authority. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075442">Under the Australian legislation there are some limits that are placed on the ability of the person to contact a lawyer of his or her choice. For example, if the prescribed authority is satisfied that on the basis of circumstances relating to the lawyer, if the person is allowed to contact the lawyer, a person involved in a terrorism offence may be alerted that the offence is being investigated. In other words, these are steps that have been implemented to ensure that communications cannot proceed that would allow the commission of a terrorist offence. If the person subject to the warrant or his or her lawyer discloses operational information as a direct or indirect result of the issue of the warrant under the warrant prior to the expiry or for two years after the expiry of the warrant, he or she commits a crime punishable by up to five years in jail. In such a case, the offence is one of strict liability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075443">Building on previous legislation relating to organized crime, the United Kingdom's terrorism act enables investigating authorities, such as the director of public prosecutions, to compel individuals to produce documents, answer questions and provide information that is relevant to the investigation of a terrorist offence. Generally, no judicial authorization is required, which is a significant departure from our own Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075444">The U.K. also has other laws that go beyond an investigative hearing before a judge. The terrorism act of 2000 was amended in 2001 to create the offence of failing to disclose to a constable, as soon as reasonably practicable, information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of an act of terrorism. Now that is a mouthful but it is important to know that it applies where the person knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that a constable is conducting or proposes to conduct a terrorist investigation and it is punishable by up to a maximum of five years imprisonment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075445">Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> does not include a similar power. In other words, we, as a government, recognize that there is a balancing of individual rights against the public right to be protected against terrorist acts and we have chosen not to go that far. Again, it speaks to the reasonability of the legislation that is before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075446">Members may also be aware that the United States has a long-standing grand jury procedure where a federal grand jury can subpoena any person to testify under oath. Subject to claims of privilege, anyone who obstructs a grand jury risks being held in contempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075447">As we can see, Canada has, like other democratic countries, recognized the need for additional powers to investigate and/or prevent terrorism. The threat of terrorism is very real to this country. We have already experienced that in the Air India disaster. Many of the families of the victims of that disaster are not satisfied with the protections that are presently in place in Canadian law. They want additional tools for our police and our investigative authorities to investigate these kinds of crimes and, more important, to do their very best to prevent those crimes from occurring. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075448">Perhaps had we had these tools that are in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> available back then, we could have prevented such a disaster from happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075449">I have talked at length about the measures that are present in other democratic countries facing terrorist threats and whose legal systems are similar to ours. As I have endeavoured to make clear, the tools we are now seeking to re-enact would not constitute an assault on human rights. That was never the intent. In fact, this legislation would simply renew legislation that a previous government introduced. On the contrary, these would be minimally intrusive and more restrained than our foreign counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075450">Other countries similar to Canada have taken even more extreme measures to address the threat of terrorism. That is why again I say that the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document> are reasonable and measured. The provisions contained in this bill are replete with safeguards. They are restrained in scope when compared to measures found in some other democracies. They would not present a threat to Canadian values but would actually protect them by protecting Canada's citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075451"> With the re-enactment of the powers contained in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, Canada can show that it is taking measures to prevent terrorism and that it is a leader in doing so while at the same time respecting human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075452">I therefore urge all my colleagues in this House to support this very important legislation.</ParaText>

Like other government members, he tried to speak eloquently to the issue at hand, which is this bill before us. He did make a fair attempt and certainly spoke of legislation in other countries and in other jurisdictions as opposed to addressing the issue itself, which is this bill that has been brought forward again by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075454">The problem of course is that what we have before us is something that has raised serious concerns around its impact in a number of areas. The provisions were not used. It expired and Parliament chose not to renew it. The government has decided to bring it forward now. The question that has been asked by members of the opposition is why. Despite the eloquence of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128375" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>, he has not been able to respond to that issue either. When we think of the issues around the lack of funding for our police forces across the country, the question seems to be that this is a channel changer. The government is trying to change things away from its boondoggles, its misspending on the jet planes and the fake lakes and everything else it has been spending money on rather than supporting our front line police officers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075455">That has to be the question. Is the government attempting to change the channel for its mistakes and spending priorities?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075473">Mr. Speaker, I have to beg your indulgence today. The allergies are getting the upper hand on me. I am hearing things in this place that throw me for a loop, but I am comforted by the words of an amateur politician from many years ago who said, “Don’t believe anything you hear and only half what you see”. That amateur politician was Abraham Lincoln.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075474">In this debate and for the last number of years, we have seen the abuse of the word “terrorist”. The justifications for sacrificing of the rights of Canadians on the altar of terrorism, and fighting the war on terror, are reprehensible. Recently, I was sitting in my home, watching a ship full of Tamils coming to our west coast seeking refuge. I remember the government standing up and saying that terrorists were aboard that vessel. If that was true, the government should have stopped the ship long before it ever got to Canada. What evidence did it have?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075475">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, please.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075476">
                <B>Mr. Wayne Marston:</B> Go ahead, I will wait. I will pause. I am quite thrilled to pause. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075477">The reality is that the government had no evidence at that time. This is the issue before us today, the fundamental rights that we have in this country. When we are accused, we have a right to see our accuser, to see the evidence against us. All this was trashed and thrown away in the name of terrorism. The fundamental rights of Canadians were thrown away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075478">We hear, in the debate today, one of the people from the Conservative side of this House saying that if we had only had these laws in place we probably would not have had the Air India tragedy. That is offensive to the victims of the Air India tragedy. Those people know better. Those people know that the investigation was fumbled.</ParaText>

                <Affiliation DbId="128429" Type="2">Mr. Bob Dechert: </Affiliation>That is what the chair of the Air India association said.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Wayne Marston: </B> Pardon me, but I gave you your turn. You give me my turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075481">Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental offence to the people who have suffered. The government and these members talk endlessly about the rights of victims and the concern for victims. In this place is where we protect the victims, where we work together, or should work together, to protect them. In this debate, on something so fundamental as the rights of Canadians, the long gun registry is tossed in, the long form is tossed in. Anything to score crass political points is tossed into this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075482">Are they really standing up for Canadians? I do not think so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075483">In our history as a country, we have failed Canadians. We have failed people from around the world. There have been times in this country, in the second world war, where we detained our own citizens. Subsequently, we had to apologize. In my home community of Hamilton, in the spring of this year, there was a gathering of folks well into their eighties, remembering how they were interned and how their fathers and grandfathers of Italian descent were interned. That was a mistake that seemed to be right at the time, because people were fearful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075484">Again in 1970, watching television one night, 48 hours after Mr. Pierre Laporte and another gentleman from the British consulate were taken hostage, we had the War Measures Act proclaimed against Canadians. It was not against those people who today might be called terrorists. It was against Canadians. They went into the law offices. They went into offices of labour unions and took files that had absolutely nothing to do with it. That was a time when there was free rein in this country to do whatever one wanted, in the name of the War Measures Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075485">We are sitting here today, looking at another place in history, another opportunity to say to ourselves that maybe, just maybe, because we have not used this since we put this act into place, it may not be necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075486">Earlier today, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> was talking about the War Measures Act. He said that we have learned in the last eight years that there was no need for that legislation. The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister </Affiliation>said today that we might need it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075487">If it were not for the fact that we are dealing with fundamental human rights and liberties, there might be some merit to this and some logic to the argument, but these two sections of the anti-terrorist legislation contain a serious incursion into rights that have existed in this country since pre-Confederation, rights that go back 400 or 500 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075488">As this debate continues in this, Canada's home of law and justice, our House of Commons, I want to give a brief history lesson that puts in place what the member for <Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> was talking about. This is going to sound strange in the beginning, I assure everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075489">What happened in the year 1215? What was the major event of 1215? Of course none of us sits around thinking about it, but it was the Magna Carta. It was issued in that year and then issued later in the 13th century, a modified version. At the time, it had removed certain temporary provisions. Is everyone now hearing the words “temporary provisions”?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075490">The bill that we are addressing, Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, had a sunset clause. I often find fault with the official opposition, but it did one thing right in the moment of fear following 9/11 when we were wondering what we should do as a country. Opposition members knew they were going to try to put into place legislation that would allow incursion into the rights of Canadians. When they did that, they said maybe it was not something that should be permanent, so they put in a sunset clause. The Supreme Court of this country ruled on it, as everyone will recall, and that is part of the reason we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075491">I want to take everyone back to the Magna Carta. The charter was first passed into law in 1225 and then again in 1297 with the long title, “The Great Charter of the Liberties of England, and of the Liberties of the Forest”, which remains in the statutes of England and Wales.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075492">People will remember that in 1215 King John was the king of England. It was his barons who forced him to proclaim those certain liberties. It is amazing that he had to accept that his will was not arbitrary. He accepted that no free man, which was the language of the day I say to my sisters here today, could be punished except through the law of the land. That is a right that exists to this day. That is the right that our veterans have fought for in conflict after conflict. It is enshrined in law in almost all the democracies of the world. No free man could be punished except through the law of the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075493">What do we have today? In the name of terror, terrorism, or whatever the latest word is, we are going to change the law of the land to take away, permanently, the rights of Canadians. In Parliament, our home for establishing laws for Canada, following 9/11 we strayed from the goals of the Magna Carta. Maybe, just maybe, we began acting a little too much like King John and others who would seek too much control. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075494">We saw a similar thing occur in the United States. I can still recall, following 9/11, the picture of the Congress and the Senate gathered together. They had been under attack. Several thousand people died and it was a country that was very worried about what was coming next, and rightfully so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075495">Nobody in this place will try to minimize the fact that there are people in the world who seek to do destructive things. The hardest balance that any government has to make, the one that faced this House of Commons about nine years ago, was to balance rights against protecting the people. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075496">We have had nearly 10 years now where it has not been needed. Even though the sunset clause did not run its course properly, we could get into the why of that, but I think I will pass on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075497">Where once the king, or in our case, Parliament, was tasked with protecting the liberties of its citizens, the government of the day set out to legally circumvent the rights inherent to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075498">The Magna Carta was forced on an English king by a group of his barons. It was done in an attempt to limit his powers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075499">Here we are today, doing the reverse of that. We are trying to increase the subversive kind of powers of government, those powers that we do not want to have hidden behind doors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075500">In this place I have defended Omar Khadr repeatedly and called upon the government to do the right thing in Omar Khadr's case. My point is that if we look at Guantanamo Bay and how the United States government moved to Guantanamo to avoid being subject to the laws of its country and they still call it a democratic country, we are here today talking about doing something similar. We are not setting up a hidden place; we are doing it in the House, no doubt. However, in the year 1100, there was a Charter of Liberties, when King Henry I had to specify particular areas where he would allow his power to be impinged upon, or be pushed back, or be controlled. That was at the behest of the people, one more time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075501">The people in my riding who have talked to me repeatedly about the injustices that we saw with the Japanese in World War II, the Italians in World War II, the <I>Komagata Maru</I> at the turn of the 20th century and other mistakes that were made in Canada say, “Beware. Be cautious. Be careful. Do not so cavalierly give away the rights of Canadian citizens”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075502">In the 13th century, to refer again to the outcomes of the Magna Carta, nearly all of its clauses had been repealed by that time. We should think about that for a second. We had, back in the 12th and 13th century, a move toward rights and freedoms for people, and over the next centuries they were repealed and pulled back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075503">However, there were three main clauses that remained part of the law of England and Wales, and to a great extent they are to be found elsewhere in the world because they are the fundamental basis of so many important things in law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075504">Lord Denning described it as the greatest constitutional document of all time, the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of a despot. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075505">They were thinking in terms of a monarchy, but when a government, any government, gives itself too much control, it is setting itself up for that accusation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075508">The three things that were important were the right of habeas corpus, or the Habeas Corpus Act; the Petition of Right; and the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075509">However, if we think in terms of habeas corpus, if we think in terms of what I started this speech talking about, the right of a person, a Canadian, to know the evidence against them, to face their accuser in a court of law, and to have the apprehension of that individual done in conformity with the laws of Canada, we had the situation recently of the Toronto 18. We had the apprehension of those folks. It went through the process and we had a turn of guilt in one instance. We have had, right here in this community, other arrests that have taken place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075510">I want to go back again to the charter as an important part of the extension of history's process that led to the rule of constitutional law in the English-speaking world. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2075511">I keep talking about the foundation of our rights. In practice, the Magna Carta in the medieval period did not, in general, limit the power of the kings. However, by the time of the English Civil War, it had become an important symbol for those who wished to show the king or queen that they were bound by law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075512">What does this ancient document have to do with limiting the power of kings, and how has that happened within the structure of Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075513">It seems that with the government, on this issue, as with the previous Liberal government, the rights of Canadians were denigrated and dismissed in the name of the war on terror. To the credit of the Parliament that sought to limit the rights of Canadians under the Anti-terrorism Act, the government added the sunset clause, which was referred to earlier, to see an end to these abuses in the year 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075514">Today the Conservative government argues that it needs the same oppressive tools again, those that we find today in Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>. I would argue that the provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code are effective enough. Again, I refer to the Toronto 18. We had arrests and we had convictions in those cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075515">In Canada we are not required to give testimony that incriminates us. Being a child brought up in the 1950s, I always called that the fifth amendment, because I did not realize that we were referring to the United States. It is a fundamental aspect of justice. One is not required to incriminate oneself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075516">We have rights under habeas corpus. We have the right to a speedy trial, to see the evidence against us, and to meet our accusers face to face. I would ask whether the members present are prepared to sacrifice the rights given to free people that have been in place since the time of the Magna Carta, that have evolved over the history of this country and other primarily English-speaking countries, the so-called British Empire countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075517">Those are our roots. That is who we are. Again, the question is whether we will allow the government to become like the court of a kingdom that represents the interests of the king. Do we know any kings in this place? Will we stand with and for great Canadians everywhere?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075518">In terms of the change in this country and the change that has happened to Canadian citizens as brought about by this government, there is a change in the fundamental direction and attitude of services provided and the protection of Canadian citizens, such as the G20 protection of Canadian citizens. I am sure that we will hear much more about it in this place. We saw protestors marching. In amongst those protesters there were people misbehaving. There were people breaking the law, but we saw wholesale arrest and detainment. I know the story of one lady who was picked off the line, put into a police car, driven for four hours, and then released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075519">Are we going to allow people to be picked off the streets, detained with no charge, and released and told they are free to go because the event is over? That is what happened at the G20.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075520">On behalf of the constituents of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, I am supposed to trust a government to allow that G-20 type of activity to take place. It was a peaceful march, and they could have easily apprehended those people who were the problem that day. If it was allowed to go to the place it went, how am I supposed to trust the government with more powers and more authority?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075521">I say that if we pass Bill <Document DbId="4448899" Type="3">C-17</Document>, what we are actually doing is giving away fundamental rights of Canadians and opening them up to the kind of abuse, in a broader way, we saw at the G-20.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075522">I will conclude today by saying that I stand here proudly with the rest of my friends, and particularly with my friend from <Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>, who gave such an eloquent speech earlier today. I almost tried to give the same speech again. It was so tempting, because he spoke directly to the heart of this issue.</ParaText>

He said that there were terrorists and other immigrants coming to this country aboard that ship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075525">My challenge to my colleague is in a rhetorical sense. If the minister knew this, how did he know this? Where did he get the evidence? Who was supplying the evidence? It would have been investigative authorities who, if they knew this, would have known it before that ship left the country it left from. If that were the case, the intervention should have been made there. That is my point about dealing with it before it comes to Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075526">Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech made by my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128487" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation>. I appreciated and enjoyed his comments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075527">I wonder if he would agree with my assessment of part of what is happening here. We have seen that whenever the government does not like the way things are going, it brings forward one of its crime bills. In fact, at times over the past few years we have seen some of the so-called tough-on-crime bills languish. They just sat around for months when the government did not bother to call them. The Conservatives would then try to blame this side of the House or blame the Senate or whomever for the fact that those bills had not gone forward. In fact, the government had not put them on the order paper each day to make that happen. They had not brought them forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075528">When the government wants to change the channel, it tries to create fear in people. We have seen that with the census. The Conservatives want people to be afraid that those terrible census takers are going to arrest them. My hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128375" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> was actually claiming a few minutes ago that this is the reason we have the census. I do not think there is a question on there asking if one has been arrested or jailed for not answering the long-form census. In fact, no one has ever been arrested for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075529">We have seen the fear the Conservatives create by suggesting that Russian bombers, propellor aircraft that are 40 years old that do not even enter Canadian airspace, are a huge threat to us. Therefore, we need these F-35s, these $16 billion worth of fighters. I wonder if my colleague would agree with that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075531">To be serious for a moment about an incursion by the Soviet Union, now Russia, and the capabilities they have, no matter what kind of airplane they have in the air, 15 minutes after that missile is warmed up, it is going to be visiting us in downtown Ottawa. To be very clear, we do need to have an air defence system with the capacity to protect our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075532"> Our concern, as a party, was the method with which these aircraft were ordered. They were ordered in a single-source type of venture. There should have been discussion in this House. It should have gone to committees of this House. We should have had the input of our generals, who clearly, from the freedom of information we read today, were expecting to have the posting for the sale and purchase of these particular aircraft. We have $16 billion. If we had bought half, we would have $8 billion to do something for seniors and other people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075533">Coming to the point of fear, the government relies on the fear of Canadians, unfortunately. We see it on many fronts. The Conservatives were not so concerned about it that they could prevent themselves from proroguing the House twice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075534">Mr. Speaker, in his presentation, the member pointed out the fact that this legislation was introduced under very tough circumstances in 2001 but that it did have, and rightly so, a sunset clause after five years, which legislation of this type usually has and should have. However, when it did expire after not having been applied or used, no movement was made to renew the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075535">We have provisions under the current laws to deal with these sort of situations. As the member pointed out, we have the situation in Toronto with people being caught and charged with terrorism. We have a similar situation in Ottawa. I would also like to point out that only a few years ago in Manitoba when the Queen visited, there were two or three people who made some threats and I was told that they were simply picked up and removed for the period of time of the Queen's visit. I do not know where they were taken or what the police did with them but they just disappeared from the scene for a period of hours. Clearly, under the current laws in this country, there is ample provision for dealing with threats. We have been dealing with this issue for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075536"> This is a lot of window dressing on the part of a desperate government that is sinking fast in the polls and trying to recover. It comes up with some boutique crime bills that it hopes will translate into some gains in the polls. The government should know by now that it did not work in the past, that it does not seem to be working right now and that it probably will not work in the future. It should look back to the minority Parliament of Lester Pearson where, in roughly the same period of time of six years, the Lester Pearson government worked with the opposition and brought in a new flag. It joined the armed forces, brought in medicare and did many progressive things. The sooner the current government figures out that it should start working with the opposition we then could have some new initiatives for this country, but nothing is happening because of the Conservatives' belligerent attitude toward the opposition and to Parliament.</ParaText>

One of them is the street racing bill. For criminal negligence causing death or injury, those tools are available to the police to deal with these offences. It was a serious issue in a part of Canada. and I will not go into the particular area, but the reality of the situation is that the tools were there. We have not heard about a massive usage of this new legislation and that is an example of where a demonstrated fear was taken advantage of for crass political reasons as far as I am concerned.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> I remind the House that the motion was nonetheless adopted and that the government is duty bound to respect the decisions made by the House of Commons....the Liberal controlled and Liberal majority Senate found yet another way to delay it...</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075542">I would like to discuss the bill I introduced, Bill C-232 to amend the Supreme Court Act. The House of Commons, by a majority vote, decided to support my Bill C-232 to amend the Supreme Court Act. Now the bill is before the Senate, where the Conservative government nearly has a majority. It does not quite have it, because the independents can shift the balance one way or the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075543">My question for the government is this: will the government ask Conservative senators to refer Bill C-232 to committee for further study, or will the senators delay things, as was done in 2005 when the current Prime Minister, who was Leader of the Opposition at the time, said that Liberal senators were delaying a bill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075544">Would the Conservatives be in the same position? This government said that it wanted to be transparent and wanted to change things. It said that it disagreed with having the Senate vote on bills from elected members of the House of Commons. In this case, elected members passed Bill C-232 to amend the Supreme Court Act. Will the Prime Minister order or tell his senators, who support him 300%, that the elected members of the House of Commons made a decision and that he would like Bill C-232 to be studied in committee and things to go as they should?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075545">Otherwise, that goes against what he believes in, or what he wanted to make people believe when he was in opposition. He claimed to be opposed to the Senate voting on bills from elected members of the House, but now that he nearly has a majority and the system works in his favour, we no longer hear him talking about that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075547">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak today to affirm this government's commitment to providing access to justice in both official languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075548">The Government of Canada is strongly committed to enhancing the vitality of English and French linguistic minorities in Canada and fostering the full recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian society, including our justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075549">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> raised the issue of filling vacancies in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, in particular the appointment of a bilingual judge last August in Yarmouth, in southern Nova Scotia. This appointment enhances the court's bilingual capacity, with two other supernumerary judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075550">We recognize that there must be significant linguistic capacity in our courts to provide equal access to justice in both French and English. I can confirm that bilingualism is already one of the enumerated criteria in the assessment of the judicial candidates by the judicial advisory committees. This ability is evaluated along with 14 other criteria, such as intellectual ability and analytical skills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075551"> I am confident that the current appointment process was crafted in a way that permits the Minister of Justice to address the need for access to justice in both official languages and to ensure that the federal judiciary linguistic profile provides adequate access to justice in official language minority communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075552">Under the current process, before recommending appointments, the minister confers with the chief justice of the relevant court to determine the court's needs, including linguistic capacity. As hon. members are likely aware, a chief justice's primary responsibility is to determine the overall direction of sitting on his or her court and to assign judges to cases. The chief justice strives to ensure that all cases, especially criminal cases, are heard in a timely manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075553">The chief justice is, therefore, in an excellent position to understand the needs of the communities served and identify particular needs where vacancies arise. As a result, the minister consults with the chief justice of the court for which a candidate is being considered to determine any particular needs to be addressed, including linguistic capacity. The minister also welcomes the advice of any group or individual with respect to considerations that should be taken into account when filling current vacancies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075554">It is important to understand that the federal judicial appointments process operates on the basis of detailed personal applications from interested candidates and, as such, relies primarily on a system of self-identification. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075555">With a view to improving the pool of bilingual judicial candidates, the government invites the French-speaking jurist associations and their national federation to identify individuals with the necessary qualifications and encourage them to apply, and to share their recommendations with the Minister of Justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075556">While bilingualism remains an important criterion considered in the appointment process, it is not and should not be the only factor in the selection of our judges. The primary consideration in all judicial appointments is legal excellence and merit. Other criteria must also be taken into account, such as the specific needs of the court, be it criminal or family.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075557">Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary is very confused. He is talking about the federal court in Nova Scotia, but I am talking about the Supreme Court of Canada. As for the federal courts, the law already requires each province to have bilingual judges. There can be up to three judges sitting on a federal court. There are more than one, two or three judges in each province. According to the law, all citizens can have their cases heard in their own language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075558">At the Supreme Court, it is the opposite. Currently, there are nine justices and they might have to rule upon a section of the Constitution, for example. If such a case is brought before the Supreme Court, it is not heard and understood by all nine justices because some of them are not bilingual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075559">The Commissioner of Official Languages himself said that they cannot be competent if they do not know the law that applies in a case. The laws are drafted in French and in English; they are not translated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075562">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the remarks made this evening by the opposition member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075563"> The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of supporting the development of minority language communities. To that end, in June 2008—I was also here—the government announced the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality 2008-2013, an unprecedented government-wide commitment with a budget of over $1 billion, based on two components: participation of all in linguistic duality and support for official language minority communities in the priority sectors of health, justice, immigration, economic development, arts and culture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075564">As the government has stated in the past, the overriding principles guiding the selection of members of the judiciary, including those of the highest court, are merit, legal excellence and overall representation.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075565"> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be back on Parliament Hill debating the issues of the day. One of the important issues that I have raised here before is the issue of poverty and that was the question I asked back in the spring session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075566">We know that poverty has risen with this recession that we have been going through and continue to go through. By how much? Well, we have not had a lot of information on that but the Citizens for Public Justice, along with their partners, released a study back in the spring that indicated that poverty in Canada had gone up from 9.2% to 11.7% overall, which is two and a half percentage points. Child poverty had gone up from 9.5% to 12% as a result of this recession. It showed that employment insurance and other social measures have failed many Canadians. Social assistance caseloads are up, the cost of food is up and the cost of shelter is up. We had the food banks' report less than a year ago showing that food bank usage had gone up 18% in Canada and that the government's response to this has been very weak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075567"> We have no national anti-poverty strategy in Canada. We are one of the few industrialized nations that does not have an anti-poverty strategy. We do have six provinces and one territory that now have an anti-poverty strategy. They all want the same thing. They want the federal government to come to the table and say that it takes poverty seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075568">Last year, the United Nations, in its periodic review, made a very specific recommendation, which I think was number 17, which said that Canada should have and needs to have an anti-poverty strategy. Instead of that, the government turned around and said that it was not its jurisdiction. Everybody in the country, from provinces that have these strategies, to social welfare groups, to academics, all understand that it is part of the responsibility of the federal government to step up and have a strategy. We can debate what is in that strategy but there needs to be a federal anti-poverty strategy here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075569">Since that time things have only gotten worse. The ridiculous decision to abandon the long form census will hurt groups that deal with poverty. It specifically will hurt people with disabilities in this country. Organizations, like CCD and CACL, that deal with people who have disabilities are absolutely bewildered at how the government could possibly cancel the long form census. It will have a dramatic impact on the people who are living in poverty and people who have disabilities, many of whom live in poverty. That is the situation we have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075570">We can talk about the methods that we can use to improve the situation of those living in poverty and of those who are close to living in poverty, such as increasing the guaranteed income supplement and the child tax benefit. There is ongoing discussion in this country right now among many people from all parties represented in Parliament, including the Conservative Party and Senator Hugh Segal, for example, about a basic income for Canadians. What everybody seems to understand except the government is that at the very least Canada needs to have a government that is prepared to say that poverty is an issue and that poverty is again on the increase in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075571">We did a lot to reduce poverty in the late 1990s with the child tax benefit, the guaranteed income supplement and things like that but we need to reduce poverty in Canada. We all have a role to play in that. Social agencies, provincial governments, municipal governments, everybody from Make Poverty History to the CFIB to the Chamber of Commerce understand that we need to have a national anti-poverty strategy. Why does the federal government not understand that and step forward and say that it will play its role to help those who are living in poverty, especially at time of recession?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075572">Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the member for <Affiliation DbId="128521" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> back to this session. However, I would like to put things in perspective. Despite some of what he says, we are not talking about what we might be doing. We are taking a number of steps. Even though we have come through a global recession, our Conservative government has made huge strides in helping working Canadians and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075573">The best way to fight poverty is for Canadians to be working in good jobs. Getting workers the skills they need to get back into the workforce and helping those workers find jobs have been the main focus points of our government's actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075574">In 2009-10 we invested over $4 billion in skills training, helping over 1.2 million Canadians. We have provided extra weeks of EI benefits and extended work-sharing measures to keep Canadians working and help employers. Over 255,000 jobs were protected by these changes to work-sharing alone. We extended EI special benefits to the self-employed on a voluntary basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075575"> Canadians are getting back to work. Well over 400,000 jobs have been created in the last year alone. As a result of our actions, Canada is leading the G20 out of the recession. Every action we have taken is meant to help Canadians and their families, our society's building blocks, become independent and help them contribute to the economy and to their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075576">We have introduced the working income tax benefit, or WITB as it is commonly referred to, to make work pay for low-income Canadians. The economic action plan doubled the tax relief provided through WITB. WITB helped over 900,000 Canadians just in the first year and it continues to help Canadians get over the welfare wall. We have increased the amount families in the two lowest personal income tax brackets can earn before paying taxes, meaning over one million low-income Canadians do not pay taxes at all anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075577">We have enhanced the national child benefit, the child tax benefit and introduced the child tax credit. All of these amount to thousands of dollars of assistance. We have introduced and strengthened the universal child care benefit, which alone has lifted 56,000 children out of low income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075578">We have also made record investments in affordable housing. Due to our economic action plan investments alone, thousands of projects are completed or under way, which are creating tens of thousands of jobs. In total, we are providing $7.8 billion in investments and tax relief to help stimulate the housing sector, improve housing and create jobs across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075579">The Liberal record and the record of that member does not stand up. They voted against enhancements to WITB, even though the member told our committee he thought it was a very positive thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075580">In its time in government, the then Liberal government cut social transfers to the provinces by $25 billion, leaving the provinces and many Canadians to fend for themselves. It tried to balance the books on the backs of ordinary Canadians. We did not do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075581">Back in 2002, the Liberal finance critic said that the Liberal government made the wrong choices, slashed transfers to the provinces. The provinces are still scrambling to catch up to the lost Martin years of inadequate funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075582">As the Liberal leader has said, their plans, simply put, are to add more taxes, higher taxes and billions and billions of dollars of increased spending and debt. The opposition's plans to raise taxes would halt our recovery in its tracks and, according to experts, kill about 400,000 jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075583">Unlike the opposition, our record is strong. In our time of government, we have helped children, lone parents, persons with disabilities, aboriginals. The seniors' poverty rate is among the lowest in the world. This is fact. We will continue to take actions to help Canadians. We will not talk about plans. We will take positive steps, positive action, that will help Canadians right across our great country of Canada.</ParaText>

It put $100 million into putting up signs all over the country to advertise their projects and $1 billion for the G8-G20. Just using his example, that means that the Conservatives value their signs 20 times more than they value vulnerable Canadians and the weekend meeting in Toronto 200 times as much as they value vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>

At a time when Canadians are watching their own pocketbooks and making sacrifices, the opposition has banded together to propose billions and billions of dollars in irresponsible spending that will not create a single job or leave a single dollar more in the pockets of Canadians.

              <ParaText id="2075595">This fiscal year we have seen more than 20 prominent women's organizations have their funding requests denied, many for the first time in their history. On May 26, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women began its study on the funding decisions of Status of Women Canada. At this meeting, we heard from four organizations whose projects met the program criteria, yet they were still denied funding by Status of Women Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075596">The groups that appeared at the meeting were CRIAW, the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, the Conseil d'intervention pour l'accès des femmes au travail, the New Brunswick Coalition for Pay Equity and Womenspace Resource Centre. These are all credible organizations and I do not think that anyone would question the work they do for women in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075597">Some of these groups spoke of the impact of Status of Women Canada on their creation and their development as women's organizations. For example, in a special publication on the 20th anniversary of CRIAW, the president at that time noted that had it not been for the financial support of Status of Women Canada over the years, CRIAW undoubtedly would not exist. Status of Women Canada had been providing these organizations with some funding for an extensive period of time. It had provided CRIAW with funding since its creation in 1977.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075598">Over the years, these organizations have proven to be extremely valuable and have demonstrated their expertise in the field. Their programs are highly reputable and have proven results. The research they provided was potentially invaluable in terms of government policy decisions. These organizations are truly bettering the lives of women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075599">Yet this year the government decided to deny funding. For most, this was a death blow. Because of these government decisions, most of these organizations either have or will shut their doors and cease servicing the women who have come to rely on their services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075600">The <Affiliation DbId="154352" Type="4">Minister for Status of Women</Affiliation> has said that her department is choosing to fund new organizations over old. Absolutely, fund new organizations; it is incredibly important, but not at the expense of older organizations with proven track records. If there is a greater need for funding from Status of Women Canada, then maybe the budget of the program should be reviewed, or maybe the amount of funding allotted to each organization should be reconsidered in order to accommodate both new and existing organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075601">Unfortunately, I do not believe that money is the sole reason that these organizations were refused funding. The significance of these decisions runs much deeper than a choice between new and old; it is part of the mounting evidence that the government does not seem interested in funding programs for women's equality or in funding women's organization with a track record of advocacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075602">Therefore, I will ask my question again. Could the parliamentary secretary tell us why the government is continuing to attack women in Canada? When will it end its ideological tirade and start supporting women in our country?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2075603">Mr. Speaker, our government has increased funding for women to the highest level ever seen in our country and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075604">The women's program at Status of Women Canada has two components: the women's community fund and the women's partnership fund. These programs are essential tools that allow Status of Women Canada to support the work of organizations that promote the equality of women and girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075605">In 2007, our government increased the funding capacity of the women's program to unprecedented levels. Consequently, we were able to support more Canadian women and girls, especially those most in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075606">The reaction to the increased funding for the women's program speaks for itself: in 2006, we received 145 applications, but in 2009, the call for proposals for the women's community fund alone generated almost 500 applications for funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075607"> To be eligible for funding consideration, projects must be one-offs and must work to promote the full participation of women in the economic, social and democratic life of Canada. This criterion is consistent with the three pillars established for Status of Women Canada: advancing women's and girls' economic security; ending violence against women, including aboriginal women and girls; and encouraging women's leadership and democratic participation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075608">The number of groups looking for financial support under the women's program keeps increasing. As is often the case with the funding program, it is unfortunately not always possible to fund all the projects that deserve to be funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075609">In 2009-10, 78 valid and important community projects were approved. Of that number, 34 were from groups that were receiving funding for the first time. The full list of projects funded is available in a press release issued on May 6 on the Status of Women Canada website.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075610">According to the organizations whose 78 projects received funding, these projects will have a direct impact on more than 24,000 women in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075611">These projects will have positive results for women from diverse backgrounds in a large number of communities. I only have enough time to name a few: the Newfoundland Aboriginal Women's Network set up a project called “Empowering Aboriginal Women; Influencing Community Wellness”. This 24-month project will promote violence prevention by facilitating leadership skills development in 84 community workshops with 500 aboriginal women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075612">Status of Women Canada and our government are concerned about women in Canada and Quebec, aboriginal women, all the women here today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075613">Mr. Speaker, I wish I could believe those words, but I do not think this is about choosing at all. It is an example of the government's agenda to silence women in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075614">We have been witnessing this silencing since 2006, with cuts to Status of Women Canada's budget; the changes to Status of Women Canada's program funding mandate; the closure of 12 regional Status of Women Canada offices; the abandonment of the court challenges program; and most recently, the termination of the mandatory long form of the census.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2075615">Through the government's policies and actions, we are witnessing the systematic attempt to kill the women's movement and feminism in this country. It is an attempt to stifle some very important voices, especially those who speak for the poor and marginalized women in this country. This is the effect of what is happening. The government may insist that this is not the intention, but it is certainly the effect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2075618">The status of women has always been important to our government. The NDP member has voted against every single program we have introduced. She voted against all of our measures to help women in Canada and in her community.</ParaText>
