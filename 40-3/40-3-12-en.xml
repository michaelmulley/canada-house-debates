            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1813334">Mr. Speaker, I have two reports to present this morning. They will require some explanation, so I hope the House will indulge me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813335">I have the honour to present, in both official languages, the first report of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813336">At its meeting on Thursday, March 11 the committee unanimously adopted a motion that the 10th report entitled “The Privacy Act: First Steps Towards Renewal” adopted and presented to the House in the second session of the 40th Parliament be adopted as a report of the committee in the present session, and that the chair present the report to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813337">The report tabled in the last session requested that the government table a comprehensive response to the report pursuant to Standing Order 109. As the government did in fact table its response to the report on October 9, the report being tabled today is identical in all respects to the report tabled last session with the exception that it does not include pages 29 and 30, which only requested a government response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813338">The minutes and evidence of the meeting of March 11 will reflect that the chair is to specifically advise the House that we are not requesting a government response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813339">By way of explanation, the committee was not satisfied with the government response, and on November 26, 2009, the committee unanimously passed a motion that the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> be requested to address each of the recommendations in the report and provide background for his caution and concerns by January 15.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813340">On December 10, 2009, the minister wrote to the committee and agreed to comply, subject to an extension to February 15. The committee concurred with the extension but no response has yet been received. Although the House was prorogued on December 30, the committee anticipated that a response would still be forthcoming. Discussions have been held with the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> to resolve this matter and we await his consideration for his undertakings and his response to our invitation to him to appear before committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813341">Finally, ostensibly the reason for re-tabling this report in the House is so that there is a report which the committee can refer to in the current session. I expect that there may be other committees that have similar situations as a consequence of the last prorogation of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813342">I also have the honour to present, in both official languages, the second report of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813343">At its meeting on Thursday, March 11 the committee unanimously adopted a motion that the 11th report entitled “The Access to Information Act: First Steps Towards Renewal” adopted and presented to the House in the second session of the 40th Parliament be adopted as a report of the committee in the present session, and that the chair present the report to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813344">The report tabled in the last session requests that the government table a comprehensive response to the report pursuant to Standing Order 109. As the government tabled its response to the report on October 9, 2009, the report being tabled today is identical in all respects to the report tabled last session with the exception that it does not include pages 31 and 32, which only requested a government response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813345">The minutes and evidence of the committee meeting of March 11 will reflect that the chair will specifically advise the House that we are not requesting a government response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813346">By way of explanation again, similarly, the committee was not satisfied with the government response of October 9, 2009, and on November 26 the committee unanimously passed a motion that the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> be requested to address each of the recommendations in the report and provide background for his caution and concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813347">For the record, identical to the previous statement, we are still in discussions and we look forward to receiving the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister's</Affiliation> concurrence with our request for him to respond and to appear before committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813392">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be able to take up this matter with the House this morning. It is probably going to take a few minutes. I hope members will bear with me. I gather there are other colleagues who wish to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813393">Mr. Speaker, I brought notice of this question of privilege to you on February 18, prior to the resumption of the House. The issue stretches back to approximately December 1, when I rose in the House to bring to the attention of the House the words of the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> in response to a question in question period. They were words that I believed would potentially obstruct witnesses before our committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813394">I brought three matters to your attention. Today, I am going to refer to one as a prelude, the one dealing with the words of the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. Second, there is one organic matter that I believe is a breach of our privileges, involving correspondence from the Department of Justice to our law clerk and parliamentary counsel here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813395">In all three instances, but technically in just two here today, these actions taken or not taken here, in my view, impugn, obstruct or derogate from the inquiry powers of the House as an integral and core function. It is part of our constitutional legislative function here as grand inquest of the nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813396">No citation should be needed here, but for the record, and I am not going to quote them, I will simply list the three citations: the words of Edward Coke in the year 1671, from the <I>Institutes of the Laws of England</I>, volume 4; Bourinot's <I>Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in the Dominion of Canada</I>, 1916, page 70; and the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada v. Vaid, S.C.R. 2005, page 20, not that any court validation is constitutionally necessary for us here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813397">These benchmarks reflect 340 years of bedrock constitutional history. I have selected these dates to show the length of time this constitutional provision has remained the same. It has not varied for 350 years. If anyone thinks it has, I invite them to find a precedent anywhere in the developed world where there is a parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813398">Initially, these laws were developed in Westminster. I have gone back 350 years to show one of the routes taking us right into modern Canadian law, with that citation from the Supreme Court of Canada. I am not making this up as I go along, and we in Parliament are not making this up as we go along. This is a three-century bedrock constitutional power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813399">One of the powers and privileges we have here in this inquiry function is the power to send for persons, papers and records. The powers among those described in the Erskine May classic definition of privilege are in edition 21 on page 69. I will not read them, as members have heard them hundreds of times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813400">The power is also codified in our House Standing Orders, specifically in Standing Order 108(1)(a). The key words are that we are “empowered to examine and inquire” and that we are empowered to send for “persons, papers and records”. These are also bedrock and elementary House of Commons 101 constitutional law principles. If anyone disagrees, again, let them find a precedent or let them make an amendment to our Canadian Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813401">I also need to make two quick reference points just to shape my remarks. The power to send for persons, papers and records exercised by the House and its committees is whole, complete and unabridged.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1813402">The delegation of this complete power from the House to its committees in Standing Order 108 is full and unconditional. There are no words, phrases, precedents, events or statutes that distinguish this power in the hands of committees from that of the House itself, and I cite the words of Speaker Fraser on March 17, 1987, when he said:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think it is important to emphasize, in case there should be any misconception in any quarter concerning the powers and functions of parliamentary committees, that committees appointed by this House are entitled to exercise all or any of the powers that this House delegates to them. These powers include the right not only to invite witnesses to appear but to summon them to appear, if necessary.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813404">If there is non-compliance, a separate enforcement procedure or punishment procedure or coercion, usually a contempt matter, can be initiated in the House, sometimes relying on the Sergeant-at-Arms. Our committees would not usually have this enforcement power on their own, unless the House were to pass a statute specifically for that purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813405">This separation of the subpoena power from the enforcement, coercion and punishment power and procedure has confused some, even some of us in the House. By analogy, the House of Commons and Parliament pass and adopt criminal laws, but we do not enforce them. The police and the courts do. However, this does not mean that Parliament does not have the full power to pass the criminal laws in the first place. An order issued pursuant to a power to send for persons, papers and records is full and complete and binding, and failing compliance, enforcement and punishment can be pursued and has been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813406">I note that many of our administrative tribunals and our cousins in the American congressional houses and committees also have a similar separation of the enforcement procedure, which they have assigned to civil or federal courts. This assignment in no way derogates from the fullness of their subpoena powers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813407">My second point of reference is that many Canadian statutes refer to bodies or agencies that have a power to compel attendance or the production of documents. This House of Parliament under our Constitution, of course, is not included among those references. As far as I can determine, this House and its powers are distinct from every other organ of government, and no statute is needed to provide for those powers and no statute or constitutional provision abridges those powers and the associated privileges, other than has been done explicitly in the Parliament of Canada Act. Such statutory references as compelling the production of documents or attendance do not describe Parliament and are not helpful for analysis or comparison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813408">What are the breaches? First, the words of the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, I would say, describe a prelude to the breach.

              <ParaText id="1813444">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">This matter was considered in 1935 by a committee of the Commons which reported that, in its opinion, it was a breach of privilege to give any advice to a witness which took the form of pressure or of interference with his freedom to form and express his own opinions honestly in the light of all the facts known to him; and the House resolved that it agreed with the committee in its report.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813445">The proceedings in 1991 in the justice committee and in this House involving the persons known as Légère and Gingras may for some have raised at that time arguably legitimate questions as to the extent of the power to send for persons, papers and records. Speaker Fraser seems to have allowed for that, notwithstanding his clear 1987 words referred to earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813446">At this time, 18 years later, following the report of the committee that reviewed that subpoena power, the unanimous House order to the government to turn over the unexpurgated documents to the justice committee at that time, the 1999 publication of a book here on this very subject, and the publication of two editions of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, there are no uncertainties, in my view, or questions unanswered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813447">There is no unclear law as to the powers of the House and its committees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813448">I would like to reuse, with some licence, the dictum, “There are none so blind as those who will not see, read or learn”. Those who purport to govern and administer Canada must be taken to know the place of the Magna Carta and the events of 1648, as messy as they were; 1689, the Bill of Rights; 1867, our Constitution; and 1982, in our constitutional history. They must also be taken to know the constitutional accountability of the government to this elected House with all its inquiry functions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813449">Canadians do not elect governments; they elect a House. The breach by that party, the alleged breach that I have brought to your attention here today, is in this light a cardinal insult to this House and all Canadians represented here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813450">If the breaches were co-ordinated in a conspiracy.... Perhaps I should not use that word in the criminal sense, but if people get together to bring this to us and present this in a certain way, then I say that if they did that, it would be constitutionally seditious and immediately deserving of sanction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813451">Lastly, there is no place in this country where this issue can be raised and acted on. There is no department of government and there is no court allowed to interfere. There are no other persons who can come into this House to protect the constitutional foundations of this country, only the 308 persons here. So if we do not stand up for our Parliament's role on behalf of Canadians, then there is no one else out there to do it. It is an attempt to undermine the work of Parliament and its committees that I place before the House today. If we do not stand up, those efforts to undermine our Constitution will have succeeded. We cannot let that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813452">I will close in saying that I am, of course, prepared to move an appropriate motion if you find a prima facie case here. I indicate to all colleagues, including those who will rise on this matter today, that there is the opportunity to work in a non-partisan, collaborative way to craft a resolution, to craft a motion that would suit the needs of the House and the people of Canada. I say that because at some point the Speaker will have to make a ruling and there is only so much time we have to work on this. But it is possible; it is not impossible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813454">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege concerning the House of Commons' right of access to documents it deems necessary to hold the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813455">As the Speaker of the House will know, the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan is studying the issue of Afghan detainees captured by Canadians, who may have been subjected to torture, and potentially Canada's complicity in violation of its obligations under international human rights law and other matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813456">I will not repeat to the House how vital and fundamental such a responsibility of Parliament is. It is part of our duty, and one of the fundamental roles of the House of Commons, to hold the government to account. In order to assist us in doing that, Parliament has certain rights, privileges and powers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813457"> It is only through this House and the elected members of this House that Canadians are able to hold the government to account. That is a basic tenet of our democracy. In fact, that right is recognized explicitly in section 18 of Canada's Constitution Act, 1867. In fact it has been, I suppose not surprisingly, recognized as a constitutional right in the House, notably on October 31, 1991 by Speaker Fraser, at page 4309 of that day's <I>Hansard</I>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813458">Also, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed, recognized and acknowledged that this is a constitutional right and a constitutional privilege of members of the House of Commons to carry out their work. It was recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly) found in the 1993 Supreme Court of Canada Reports at 1 S.C.R. 319.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813459">In pursuance of its obligations to carry out the investigation, members of the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan asked for certain papers and have sought the assistance of this House to get them. </ParaText>

However, over three months have passed since that House order was made and not one single document of any kind has been presented to the House in response to that order.

              <ParaText id="1813468">Page 475 of O'Brien and Bosc states that orders for the production of documents must be met “within a reasonable time”. Given that the government prorogued the House on December 30 and we did not meet again until early March, the government has had plenty of time to work out a method to make these documents available to the House and to honour the order. The government has failed to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813469">We recognize that the government cannot and should not be expected to dump hundreds or thousands of pages of unredacted documents on the table of the House of Commons.

              <ParaText id="1813488">Mr. Speaker, the government has appointed a retired Supreme Court justice, Mr. Iacobucci, to review the documents and advise the government on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813489">As you know, Mr. Speaker, the government has the right to seek advice from anyone it wishes, whether it be Department of Justice lawyers or other lawyers, or retired justices who are continuing to act as lawyers. That is certainly the government's right. In this particular case, the government waited three months to even consult with Mr. Iacobucci.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813490">As far as we are concerned, it is not a major concern to this House that the government is seeking advice. Obviously, we have respect for Mr. Iacobucci. The government has the right of course to consult with any number of people, but it does not change the order of this House. The order is binding, and with consultation or no consultation, the government must obey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813491">The government's establishment of a separate parallel process outside of parliamentary oversight, parliamentary accountability, or even involvement, does not satisfy the very explicit requirements of the House in relation to the documents. For all intents and purposes, therefore, the engagement of Mr. Iacobucci to give the government advice is irrelevant to this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813492">I would like to address the potential argument that the government may make to excuse its behaviour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813493">In O'Brien and Bosc, page 83, it states that a breach of privilege includes “deliberately altering, suppressing, concealing or destroying a paper required to be produced for the House...”. It may also involve failing to produce papers formally required by the House without a reasonable excuse, or disobeying a lawful order of the House without a reasonable excuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813494">This includes the defacing of documents by redactions, expurgations, black marks or whatever we want to call it, and we have all seen those documents, certainly is destroying or concealing a paper required to be produced by the House, and therefore we expect to get them in their unexpurgated form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813495">The question is whether there is a reasonable excuse for disobeying an order of this House. It is clear to us that this a breach of the privileges of the House. In fact I would go so far as to say that the government's behaviour is tantamount to contempt for this House. The government may take issue with the phrase “without reasonable excuse”, and I want to address it directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813496">There is no reference in our Standing Orders to national security. In fact we see the issue of national security as a red herring. Parliamentarians have themselves acknowledged the valid national security concerns and have repeatedly indicated their willingness to work around them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813497">The motion that passed in the House in December did not say that the documents must be publicly tabled, placed on the Internet or handed out to the public for all and sundry. The motion allows for flexibility and for an approach by the government to work with the opposition parties and parliamentarians to satisfy the concerns on all sides. It is not acceptable to use national security as an excuse to hide embarrassing information. It is also not acceptable to use it as an excuse when the government has made no attempt to work around it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813498">There are numerous ways that the documents in question could have been made available without divulging state secrets, and there is no reasonable excuse for failing even to address the issue in the House. These issues have been discussed with the parliamentary law clerk as to how a committee could receive documents and yet protect national security. What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and respect the privileges of members of Parliament to hold the government to account on behalf of Canadians, while at the same time protect national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813499">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that there is a clear case for the finding of a prima facie breach of privilege, and if you agree, I am prepared to move a motion. I want to indicate that this motion has already been discussed with other members of the opposition parties. The Bloc Québécois has indicated that it supports our motion in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813500">It is important to put the motion on the record to understand where I am coming from in terms of what we expect to see happen in order for the House to be able to exercise its parliamentary privileges, and at the same time, find a way to get these documents before it so that we can do our constitutional duty.</ParaText>

You are quite correct in stating that most of what has been heard this morning on these questions of privilege are quite common to a central issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813545">I would like to make a few general comments with respect to some of the comments made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> in his intervention. Initially, I should also say the questions of privilege are fundamentally and historically raised at the first opportunity. This has generally been an accepted requirement of the House. I would first argue that these questions of privilege have not been raised at the first and the earliest opportunity, since they are referring to an order of the House of December 10 and now we are well into the month of March. However, Mr. Speaker, I would trust your judgment on giving that some consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813546">With respect to one of the first points raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, he seemed to take some issue with comments and statements made by the <Affiliation DbId="147107" Type="96">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. I would point out that words of a minister are really matters of debate and, quite frankly, differences of opinion are matters of debate in the House, not a question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813547">The second point raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> was also raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128161" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, and that is the crux of the arguments on production of documents surrounding the Afghan detainee issues and whether Parliament has the right to ask for those documents to be produced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813548">I would like to make an initial response to all these questions of privilege and raise some points that I think should be taken under very careful consideration, and I trust you will, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813549"> The immediate question for decision is whether there is a prima facie evidence of a breach that would justify setting aside all other business, consider such a motion as might be allowed by the Speaker and considered by the House. It is by respectful submission that, at this time, such a finding is not justified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813550">The most critical point for your consideration, Mr. Speaker, and is the crux of this issue, is the order of the House, passed on December 10, listed a considerable catalogue of categories of documents and ordered that, “accordingly the House hereby orders that these documents be produced in their original and uncensored form forthwith”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813551">However, and this is the critical point, the order of the House made on December 10 made no provision to protect the security of these documents as outlined in the December 10 order of the House. No protection of the security of these documents was made in that order. Were these documents to be produced right now under this order, these documents would be immediately and fully in the public domain, with no consideration for the sensitivity or the security concerns contained in those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813552">I would also like to ask a question of all three of my hon. colleagues who raised these questions of privilege, and that is simply this. Could they ever give an example where the House has compelled the government of the day to produce documents that endangered national security or the security of our military? The answer is quite clearly, no. They are asking for that now, with no provisions in place to protect the security of such documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813553">In fact, I would point out in his intervention the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> talked about the Afghanistan committee putting in place security provisions to protect security of these documents. Why has that not been done now? There is much more work to be done on this issue, yet although the member for St. John's East seems to indicate the security provisions must be made and must be provided, nothing has been done to date. Yet he is asking for documents to be produced without provisions to protect the security of these documents and to protect the security of our military and of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813554">Every member of the House knows and fully understands that the issues of military and diplomatic security are at issue concerning the release of these documents. I do not think there is any question of that.</ParaText>

I would point out that you went on to say that the Speaker had no role in reviewing documents in this circumstance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813563">As you know, Mr. Speaker, there is an ongoing process to prepare documents for the House. Officials of the Department of Justice and Justice Iacobucci are engaged in preparing documents. The House has always accepted that national security justifies withholding papers from the House. In fact, once again, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> indicates that they are not asking for everything to be produced and to be made public. Our government has put in place a process to protect the security. Let that process work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813564">In this instance, our government is taking unprecedented measures to disclose what can be disclosed. We have put in place a review process by a person of expertise, experience and repute. I submit that these measures indicate that the government is making every possible effort to comply with the order of the House of December 10, consistent with the competing requirement to protect the security of our forces and our international obligations. The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has kept the House well informed of all of our efforts in this regard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813566">Mr. Speaker, I do not want to burden your ears too much, but in light of some of the comments that have been made, I want to make a couple of points to, I hope, clarify the situation. Obviously, it has been a matter of some contention over the last several months and a matter of some emotion between members. That is understandable, with the many allegations and accusations that have been made flying in almost every conceivable direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813567">With the comments made by my colleague and also by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and my colleague from the Bloc, with whom I have served with on the Afghan special committee, as well as my friend from Scarborough, whose leadership on this issue for many years has been outstanding, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813568"> It is a serious mistake for the government to believe that what is being asked or sought is simply that documents be laid holus-bolus on the table without any regard for national security and, to borrow the phrase from my colleague from Regina, looking at the question of the issue of protection of the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813569">The protection of the military and questions of national security are matters of utmost importance to all members of the House, certainly to members of our party. What we believe can be done is not beyond the ability of the House. It is done in many other parliaments. Indeed, there are circumstances under which it has even been done in this House. It is perfectly possible for unredacted documents to be seen by members of Parliament who have been sworn in for the purpose of looking at those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813570">There is a clear difference of opinion between the opposition and the government. The government believes the appointment of Mr. Iacobucci as its special counsel provides a suitable implementation of the House of Commons resolution in December. We believe it does not, that in fact there is a legitimate issue still as to how the House can find a way to implement the resolution without having a negative impact on the issues which the government has raised as concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813571">It was for the purpose of making that one intervention, Mr. Speaker, that I wanted to rise to say that there really is a misunderstanding on the part of the government, and I take it in good faith that it is not deliberately misinterpreting what people are saying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813572">We are saying that it should be possible for the House to find a means to implement the resolution without having a negative impact on national security. The government is saying that the route it has taken is the only possible or the best possible implementation of the House resolution. That is a legitimate difference of opinion. That is why you are the Speaker. You are asked to make these judgments and to make these determinations, and we look forward to the judgment call that you make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813573">It is an important question as to the rights of Parliament to be able to deal with documents. I want to endorse the comments that my friend from Scarborough has made with respect to the question of the letter that went out from the Department of Justice, which could only be interpreted as having a chilling effect on people who are appearing before a parliamentary committee. I think it is entirely inappropriate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813575">I would like to bring up two points. First, the government representative said that we had not raised this question of privilege at the earliest opportunity. I remind members that Justice Iacobucci's mandate was presented to the House on Tuesday. That was the first time we had seen it. In the hours that followed, we prepared a motion, of which you have a copy, Mr. Speaker. We also worked with the NDP. It seems as though we acted as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813576">Second, I also remind the House that Justice Iacobucci's mandate has no time frame. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813577">This morning, Amnesty International announced that it could be up to two years before the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan has access to the documents. I am sure everyone will agree that a lot can happen in two years, and we need to find the truth as quickly as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813578">I will conclude by saying that the government is being completely unreasonable if it does not accept these proposals. The Bloc worked with the NDP to create a motion to maximize cooperation between the opposition and the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813579">I remind members that the second paragraph of the suggested motion states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813584">I would point out again, as I did in my initial submission, that the order of the House of December 10 contained no such security provisions. The order of the House that was passed on December 10 requested that documents be produced immediately with no respect and no consideration to security concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813585">That is the crux of this argument. How can documents be produced that may endanger our national security and the security of our military or our international diplomatic efforts?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813586">Once again, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> talked about the special committee on Afghanistan proposing security measures be put in place.

              <ParaText id="1813592">I will only make this one point and would want to reserve our right to argue it more extensively. The argument over national security is one that, given the rights of Parliament, is not to be determined solely by the government.

              <ParaText id="1813600">I will deal with one issue at the moment, and that was the question of timeliness of the request to raise a question of privilege in the House. I note the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> filed his request before the session of the House began, which was the first opportunity he could do that following the prorogation of the previous session, and therefore the fact that the order could not be complied with and that tablings might not be done during a prorogation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813601">Accordingly, in my view there is no lack of timeliness in this case.

              <ParaText id="1813607">Mr. Speaker, one issue not mentioned in the Speech from the Throne, in an area where serious recalibration is necessary, is with regard to the use of security certificates in Canada. We are seeing security certificates overturned and quashed by the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813608">The latest was on December 14 when Justice Richard Mosley of the Federal Court of Canada quashed the security certificate against Hassan Almrei. Mr. Almrei had been detained on an Immigration and Refugee Protection Act security certificate since 2001 as an alleged terrorism suspect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813609">The most recent certificate was issued in February 2008 signed by the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> and the then Minister of Public Safety, who is now the <Affiliation DbId="147116" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. That is eight years in jail, never having been charged, tried or convicted of a crime. It is still hard to believe that is possible in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813610">Justice Mosley, in quashing the certificate against Mr. Almrei, noted that he “was not a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe has engaged in terrorism”. That is a very serious conclusion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813611">However, there is another aspect of Justice Mosley's decision that is also very serious. As part of the judgment, he also ruled that the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> and the former Minister of Public Safety were in violation of their duty of candour to the court, noting that they had failed to provide full information on the case to the court and that they did not fully review all the information available about the case when they signed the security certificate against Mr. Almrei in 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813612">This is extremely troubling given the extraordinary circumstances of security certificates which suspend the usual process of justice in Canada. The security certificate allows for the indefinite detention without charge, trial or conviction; it withholds evidence from the accused and his or her lawyer; and it prevents even the special advocates who do get to review all the evidence from communicating with the accused about specific details or allegations. It works in camera, in secret.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813613">Given the extraordinary circumstances under which a security certificate is used, Judge Mosley points out that the government, CSIS and the ministers signing the security certificate must present all the evidence at their disposal, even that which is unfavourable to their case. He notes that in this case the certificate was:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> --assembled with information that could only be construed as unfavourable to Almrei without any serious attempt to include information to the contrary, or to update their assessment.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813615">The judge found the ministers in breach of their duty of candour to the court. It should be pointed out that he also, similarly, found CSIS to have breached its duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813616">New Democrats have long held that the security certificate process should be repealed. We feared exactly what has taken place, that the process would not be used appropriately and that due diligence would not be done, that there would be an abuse of these extraordinary powers. The government must respond to this judgment and this situation. I happen to believe personally that this matter is so serious that both ministers should be removed from cabinet and the use of security certificates should be suspended given the failures of these ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813617">Recalibration was the word used by the government to describe the need for prorogation. Serious recalibration and serious accountability measures are needed especially in light of this abuse of the security certificate process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813618">The Speech from the Throne provided no recalibration. It was just more of the same. There is no coherent vision of how to protect or create jobs for Canadians. The government could have made choices to ensure all Canadians benefit in an economic recovery, but it chose not to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813619">There is no movement to stop the corporate tax giveaway that diverts billions from lifting seniors out of poverty or helping women and children. There will be $6 billion more given to profitable corporations, big banks and big oil companies, which is especially ironic when the banks are announcing record profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813620">There is no tangible commitment on climate change. The government called climate change one of the most important challenges but offered no plan to address it, other than deregulating and speeding up tar sands development and ending the role of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813621">There is no new commitment to public transit. The government could have chosen to dedicate 1¢ per litre of the gas tax to public transit. There is no national housing program and no new affordable housing or homelessness commitment. There was silence on health care. There was nothing significant on child care. There was nothing on pay equity and there was no commitment to fair trade. Instead, the outrageous free trade deal with Colombia is the first thing that is back on the agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813622">Sadly, this is yet another disappointing agenda from the government.</ParaText>

Had he read last year's action plan, he would know that there were significant resources for community centres, roads and bridges, tax cuts for families and funding for transit across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813624"> I was delighted to participate in a $1.5 billion announcement in Toronto. His province received funding for transit, for the development of low income homes and for unemployment. In the Speech from the Throne, we talked about the reduction of red tape. We talked about moving forward with continuing our investments for communities across Canada. I can only assume that he still has not actually read the throne speech or the first part of the economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813625">I wonder how the member can continue to talk about the things that he talks about when he constantly votes against all of these investments that we are making, whether it is for low income Canadians, whether it is extending $100 for a family so they can have choice in child care, whether it is funding for our transit system, whether it is reducing tariffs on our manufacturers so they can have more money to invest in themselves and in their business or whether it is giving families more money in their pockets so they can invest in themselves and in their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813626">Why does the member constantly vote against the things Canadians want and the things our budget and throne speech set out, which are jobs and growth for Canada, so we can continue to lead the world in economic growth and provide a country that is the best country to live, work and invest in?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813628">I will just pick on one aspect of what the hon. member raised, which is the commitment to child care that is absolutely lacking in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813629">In my community, after housing, the most significant expenditure of any family is child care, and that is even before food. The government's $100 a month, which I think is even taxable, hardly makes any dent in the child care expenses of an average family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813630">However, in the throne speech and in the most recent budget what assistance is added to that? For the lowest income families, they will get another $3.25 a week toward their child care expenses. I am sure there was dancing in the streets when people heard about that generous contribution toward the child care expenses of Canadians. It amounts to nothing and it is absurd.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813632">Mr. Speaker, Canada used to play a very significant role in the whole question of ending nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation. We used to have an ambassador for disarmament who had an advocacy mandate as part of its role. Sadly, that is no longer part of the role for the ambassador for disarmament. Folks like, in the past, Douglas Roche and Peggy Mason, had that mandate and did considerable work in raising awareness and contributing to the whole movement toward nuclear disarmament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813633">The position still exists and it is staffed by very able and dedicated public servants, but, sadly, they do not have that advocacy role and it should be restored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813634">There is still significant participation by Canadians in non-governmental organizations working toward this goal, but Canada's capacity to participate in the various negotiations has declined. We do not have the public service capacity that we used to. Canada was recognized in the past as a significant player in the whole question of verification of the reduction of nuclear arms. Sadly, we have lost that capacity in some regard now. We have experts but their experience has been underutilized in that area. Canada has not come out in support of initiatives like an Arctic nuclear weapons-free zone. Canada has not endorsed the idea of a negotiation of a nuclear weapons convention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813635">I am glad there was a mention in the Speech from the Throne on the question of nuclear disarmament and nuclear proliferation but we need to get back on track and we need to put a lot more into that question.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813637">I would first and foremost like to congratulate our athletes for the superb job they did in Vancouver. The pride that we experienced as an entire country as we watched these superb men and women in their quest for excellence was truly humbling. We truly have reached a milestone, both through their achievements and as hosts of these winter games. That pride continues to grow as we watch our Paralympic athletes take on the world. We are all cheering them on as they strive for the top of the podium.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813638">I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer a reply to the Speech from the Throne because I feel, as do a great number of Canadians and constituents in my riding of Davenport, that the government missed an opportunity to address issues that are important to Canadians, and by this I mean issues from housing to homelessness, public transit, child care, the environment, creating green jobs, the arts and seniors' concerns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813639">Most clearly, the Speech from the Throne demonstrated that the government's most recent prorogation was not about recalibrating its agenda but about missed opportunities. A Latin proverb states, “History repeats itself”, but opportunity does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813640"> While we were prorogued, a number of major international events took place and Canadians would have preferred that their parliamentarians had been here at work and dealing with these troubling times. On January 12, the people of Haiti were struck by a terrible earthquake where entire cities were destroyed and an already struggling society was once again set back. We all watched with undivided attention as the relief efforts unfolded. We have still not been able to understand the full extent of the devastation in Haiti before we took action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813641">The response of our soldiers and our workers was remarkable. Canadians stood together in unwavering resolve and opened their hearts, their homes and their wallets, all in an effort to contribute to the relief efforts. There are multiple challenges facing Haiti and I hope we can work with the Haitian government and the people to deal with these challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813642">I cannot help but think, however, that so much more might have been accomplished had parliamentarians been in Ottawa, working together regardless of party affiliation, to speed the process further or define more and better ways to help the aid make its way to Haiti.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813643">One such measure might have been to send a major Canadian figure as an envoy to Haiti. We lost a valuable opportunity to send a champion on behalf of the country. We missed a great opportunity to find and use someone whose prestige would bring together both private and non-governmental organizations in an effort to make a real and lasting difference in the relief and rebuilding efforts in Haiti.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813644">Both the United States and Brazil, the other two countries leading the relief effort, appointed special envoys to Haiti to deal with the crisis. The United States called on the service of two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, to direct those efforts. The decision was not a partisan one. It was a human one. Those two Americans, regardless of political stripe, fostered an effective and lasting partnership with the Haitian community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813645">Canada has a wealth of former statespeople who could have been called upon. Why did we not call upon former prime ministers, like Paul Martin, Jean Chrétien, Kim Campbell, Joe Clark or even Brian Mulroney, to fulfill this position for us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813646">On February 20, flood waters crashed through the Portuguese Islands of Madeira killing 42 people, injuring hundreds and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. This is another event that took place when we were prorogued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813647"> I had the opportunity to speak with a number of members of the Portuguese Canadian community and express my deepest condolences. We lost the chance to express our deepest condolences as a nation from this venerable place and, moreover, there was no opportunity for us to discuss what we could do as international leaders to help in this time of need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813648">Unfortunately, tragedy also struck in Chile just before Parliament resumed. It was with truly heavy hearts that we watched a terrible force of nature destroy so many communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813649">Last week I attended a vigil at Queen's Park in Toronto where members of the Chilean community were asking the government to also match, dollar for dollar, the contributions that have been made, as it did in Haiti for the relief efforts. I encourage the government to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813650">Canada is an international leader and, as an international leader, people around the world look to Canada in times of need for guidance and assistance. The Parliament of Canada is the foremost institution of our nation and when there is no one to answer, to lend support or to speak to the world, we lose our role as leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813651">In order to no longer miss these opportunities, our priority should be institutional reform. Parliament is a venerable institution. In this place, we have achieved so much, from universal health care to the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813652">Our party has asked that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> give 10 days written notice and specific reasons should he intend to seek prorogation. This would give Parliament the opportunity to debate the merits of prorogation. We have also suggested that Parliament should not be prorogued within a year of a Speech from the Throne unless Parliament consents. Prorogation should not be a way to avoid scrutiny, so it cannot be used to escape a confidence motion or committee work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813653">We took an important step forward with yesterday's motion to require the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to seek a resolution from Parliament to prorogue for more than seven days, I would ask that the Prime Minister also respect the will of this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813654">The Speech from the Throne did not truly address the realities that seniors face today. While a seniors' day is welcome recognition of the contributions that our greatest generations have made for us, without the substance to make a significant difference, it does not amount to much more than another day. What is another day to low income seniors who spend over 55% of their income on food and shelter? When we take into account extra expenses, such as health care, clothing and transportation, times are becoming increasingly difficult for seniors. This becomes even more urgent when we consider that the percentage of Canadians over 65 years of age is expected to double in the coming 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813655">Seniors in Canada are worried and, overwhelmingly, do not believe that their interests are being considered by the government. During a round table, one of the suggestions our caucus made was for the creation of a supplementary Canada pension plan that would enable Canadians to invest more for their retirement. Constituents in my riding of Davenport have told me that they support these measures, so I do not see why the government refused to act on this plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813656">The Speech from the Throne also did not take jobs into account. Where are the green jobs? Green jobs are the jobs of the future. They are the single greatest and most sustainable way for us to make an investment in our future. Especially coming out of the recent economic crisis, we should, now more than ever, start preparing for the jobs we will need in the future, the way that countries across the world are already doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813657">We see that countries, like Brazil, are ahead of the curve. They have emerged from the recession and are now emphasizing environmentally friendly public policies and job creations through hydroelectric development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813658">In my own riding of Davenport, the government has a perfect opportunity to take action in this regard for the much needed electrification and expansion of rail routes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813659">Our caucus developed a number of suggestions going forward to deal with job creations. We have acknowledged that there is a major problem when the youth unemployment rate is double that of the overall unemployment rate. Canadian youth are looking to us now to help them earn money for school and to get extra experience in the fields in which they are training, just as we will look to them soon as the leaders of our country and the captains of our industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813660"> Canadian entrepreneurs are looking to us to help foster innovation. If we can lend any assistance to these small businesses, we will be helping them to create the jobs that we will need in the future and we will be establishing a strong Canadian brand. We have identified the need and now we need to move forward and take action on this now, instead of waiting for it to become a larger problem in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813661"> We must not miss the opportunity to continue to be a leader in the human rights field. Canada has a long and proud heritage of being a beacon around the world for the pursuit of human rights. While not mentioned in the throne speech, we need to renew our commitment to protect human rights at home, as well as in our approach to international relations. We cannot just say that we will stand up for what is right. We must demonstrate to the world that we are starting here at home.</ParaText>

He talked about Seniors' Day at one point and said that seniors do not care about recognition, but food and medicine. But earlier in his speech, he talked about the people of Haiti and that somehow it was more important to them to have a former prime minister visit Haiti than it was to get the food and medicine our government has been providing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813663">He also mentioned in his speech that history does not repeat itself. One of the reasons we made so many reinvestments in the armed forces was precisely so that history would not repeat itself. We all remember the former Liberal government's response when the tsunami hit Sri Lanka. It took that government two weeks to decide what it was going to do and another couple of weeks to figure out if it could rent a plane to bring our equipment over there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813664">The response to Haiti by this government has been completely the opposite. We were the first country to be there. Our soldiers were on the ground working right away. Canadians responded in record numbers with over $100 million for the relief effort. I am extraordinarily proud of what Canadians and our armed forces have done. I am extraordinarily proud that we are leading the way on reconstruction in Haiti.

It is unfortunate that the hon. member did not understand what I was trying to get at, but I was trying to say in a cooperative manner that we should all work together on this very important issue. I was not actually trying to be partisan on the issue of Haiti. When we are dealing with people who are faced with calamity and catastrophe we should all work together, so I did not want to make this a political issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813667">What I was trying to say is that we should accept the challenge like other countries have done of sending a special envoy to coordinate efforts. When we look at the U.S., for example, it has no problem calling upon former leaders to assist in getting more funding and coordinating efforts. I was suggesting it would be a wise idea for the government to do the same thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813668">What has been in missing in Haiti has been coordination. There are several hundred NGOs working in Haiti, and if we do not get this right this will be a disaster that could last for a very long time. We do not want to miss that opportunity. We want to make sure it is not just money that we send to Haiti, but also coordination. That is what is very important and what needs to be done. I am hoping there will be one person to deal with that and not several agencies--</ParaText>

One of the points he brought up was the whole issue of providing matching funds for the victims of the earthquake in Chile, which the government has so far been very silent about. So far we have had no matching funds by the government for donations by Canadians, unlike for Haiti. There are no Canadian warships loaded with supplies or talk of waiving immigration rules. Simply put, our response has been totally embarrassing as far as the earthquake in Chile is concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813671">I would like to ask why the hon. member thinks the government is dragging its feet. It cannot be an issue of money because we know that in the case of Haiti, there is about $200 million the government is probably going to be matching, whereas in the case of Chile we are talking about much smaller numbers. We had $10,000 raised at a social a couple of weeks ago. We have another social in Winnipeg with 1,000 tickets already sold for this weekend. But all told, the numbers are going to be much smaller in terms of matching aid when dealing with the issue in Chile. </ParaText>

Certainly, the Chilean community and the members who were there are very concerned that the government is not giving equal attention to this very important issue facing the people of Chile. I am not sure, and cannot answer, why the government is not responding in the same way and matching the funds, but I would ask it to do so, because Chile is also one of our major partners and we need to be there for Chile. I would encourage the government to be there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813674">Mr. Speaker, the Speech from the Throne was full of spin and very light on substance. When the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> called on the Governor General to prorogue Parliament and give himself three months off, he claimed he needed time to recalibrate. Yet when we came back and heard Her Excellency deliver the speech, it was really full of rehashed ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813675">The speech lacked vision. Something that really stuck out in my mind was the lack of investment in the middle class and the fact there was really no plan for job creation. In fact, the government subsequently imposed a $13 billion job-killing payroll tax in the budget, which will have a devastating impact on all Canadians, particularly in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128104" Type="2">Mississauga—Brampton South</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813676">In its reply to the Speech from the Throne, the Liberal Party has proposed an amendment to reflect our wish that Her Excellency not be burdened with future excessive requests for prorogation. I hope the government takes that into consideration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813683">On January 25, when we were supposed to be in the House of Commons, my colleagues and I and the <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> were here in Ottawa. We were doing what we should have been doing, that is, working on behalf of our constituents and Canadians. We organized well over 30 round tables, featuring a whole range of discussions on issues that matter to Canadians. This was done before and after the Olympics.

              <ParaText id="1813687">The government also refused to renew the contract of the RCMP Public Complaints Commissioner, Paul Kennedy, after he was critical of it. That is another example of another individual being refused or ultimately pushed aside. It also shut down the Military Police Complaints Commission before Richard Colvin was set to appear, and failed to renew the contract of the commissioner, Peter Tinsley. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813688">Unfortunately, I also saw first hand that the government had a book, a dirty tricks manual, to grind parliamentary committee business to a halt. I saw this firsthand in my committee, when the government would play games to avoid accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813689">The government also withheld information from the elections commissioner, which necessitated a police raid on the Conservative Party headquarters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813690">It also refused to provide adequate funding for the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The Parliamentary Budget Officer is very clearly doing his job and, of course, time and time again his numbers have consistently refuted the government's numbers, and the budget officer has questioned the credibility of the government's numbers in accounting and forecasting. Again, the government has marginalized him and his office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813691">The government also attacked the public servant Richard Colvin for doing his public duty to truthfully respond to questions from Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813692">I digress a bit, but another broken promise was clearly with respect to the upper House, the Senate. The government promised only to appoint elected senators, but we have seen in the past few weeks that recalibration was really about appointing a whole new set of senators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813693">The government promised never to raise taxes. On that I give the example of the EI payroll tax increase, which is a job killer. Furthermore, the government broke its promise on income trusts, and raised personal income taxes when it came to power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813694">Thus there is this consistent pattern of lack of accountability when it comes to the government. This is really the root cause of why we had the Speech from the Throne. As I said, it is the fourth one in four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813695">I could go on with many other examples, but the government has a pathological aversion to accountability. It holds our institutions in contempt and tries systematically to undermine public authority, while increasing the power and control over an already over-centralized PMO. It is no wonder that it produced a Speech from the Throne that offers nothing for the middle class or on creating jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813696">What is missing from the Speech from the Throne? What elements are fundamentally missing that should have been included? Despite its extraordinary length, the speech contained no specific measures to create jobs or to help the middle class, as I said before. It had no specific investments for research and development and had nothing new on clean energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813697">Of course, the government is going to continue to invest in clean energy, but it has cancelled our eco-energy program and has ensured that we are well behind other countries in terms of investments in this particular sector. In fact, China has invested far more in green technology and in creating green jobs than Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813698">There was nothing on pensions. Even though this is supposed to be a priority, the government said it wanted to consult Canadians. Again, it is punting the issue and dragging its feet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813699">However, we have put forward concrete proposals when it comes to pensions. We were very clear about our proposals in the letter we sent in advance of the budget and the Speech from the Throne. This is an issue that is a cause of concern to many Canadians. It comes up time and time again and it was missing from the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813700">There was nothing on culture. Can one imagine a Speech from the Throne with nothing in it on culture, and nothing on dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813701">The key issue for me is the fact the government should be dealing with the number one issue, the economy. Its $13 billion payroll tax is in sharp contrast to creating jobs. In fact, numerous independent sources, like the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, have indicated that this particular measure will kill over 200,000 jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813702">I want to quote the <I>National Post</I>, which I think fundamentally summarizes my position on the Speech from the Throne. It stated that:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813714">With respect to the round tables, not only did we hold them in Ottawa, but I held one in my riding, constituency of Mississauga—Brampton South. I got together over 250 small businesses with the leader of the official opposition to look at solutions. We heard directly from people in the audience and from the panel members about the government's job-killing payroll tax, which again counterproductive to creating jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813715">In terms of putting forward a concrete proposal, the <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> put forward a set of solutions well in advance. We dealt with issues such as jobs, pensions, clean energy and jobs in the environment. Shortly thereafter we also proposed a list of examples of where the government could save money, because the government is wasting taxpayer money. That amounted to over $1.2 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813716">The initiatives that we proposed, with the pensions and supplementary pension plans, with cash advances on capital cost allowances to help small business and other proposals would be funded by government's waste of taxpayer money.

When we listen to the government, people would think we were the ones who prorogued the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813718">The brain trust in the Conservative government decided that this was perhaps a good idea, to prorogue the House and set the stage for a potential election, following the great results it expected from the Olympics. The government did this when it was 10 points ahead in the polls. It did not anticipate that this would be a total political disaster, that it would end up losing its 10% and would be in the mess it is in right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813719">Now the Conservatives are very sensitive about that issue. I think they are trying to deflect the whole issue to other issues. They are trying to say that provinces prorogue houses. Provinces do but they do it in consultation with the opposition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813723">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to the Speech from the Throne, delivered by Her Excellency the Governor General. I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128372" Type="2">St. Catharines</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813724">The throne speech described t these times of both “great uncertainty and great optimism”. Where there are uncertainties, there are bound to be opportunities, which is also where optimism is often found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813725"> The global financial crisis has no doubt dampened the spirits of our nation and left us in the dark for a while, but Canadians proved ourselves to be a people of strength and resilience, who remain true to our identity even in the midst of turbulence. Although the dark cloud of the global recession has not yet left us completely, Canadians know that we have weathered the storm very well and should be proud of our achievements thus far. Through it all, we have not forgotten some of the core values that make us Canadian. We continue to welcome newcomers on to Canadian soil and foster the growth of our next generation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813726">We are a country of immigrants. In the throne speech, the Governor General stated that, “To be Canadian is to show the world that people drawn from every nation can live in harmony”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813727">I believe Richmond is a great example of this. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a peace and harmony forum, where children and young adults sang and recited scriptures from the Bible, chapters from the Koran, quotes from Confucius and other great thinkers and verses from famous poets. This is the mosaic we proudly present to the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813728">I represent a riding of this great diversity. Richmond is a beautiful city, where people from a wide spectrum of ethnic backgrounds live and work. Our country's diversity is one of our strengths. I cannot think of any other country in the world that is so accommodating and so generous to those who want to call this great nation of ours home. Thousands of people each year come to Canada to make a better life for themselves and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813729">The government certainly recognizes the importance of new immigrants to Canada. We are committed to a system that will provide the best opportunities for newcomers to succeed, while protecting the interest of all Canadian citizens. The pan-Canadian framework for the assessment and recognition of foreign credentials is part of the government's strategy to bring the best workforce in the world to the Canadian job market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813730">Since 2009, the government has committed over $50 million over two years through the Canada economic action plan to develop this framework. Going forward, the government will continue to work with the provinces and territories to strengthen recognition of foreign credentials through the framework to help internationally trained workers and professionals put their training and knowledge to work in Canada as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813731">On the flip side, the government also recognizes the severity of unscrupulous immigration consultants and their negative impact on our immigration system. In March 2009, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> announced a public information campaign to combat immigration fraud and to warn the public against unscrupulous consultants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813732">Following a year of hard work, the hon. minister announced in February of this year that the government would launch a package to reform the regulation of immigration consultants, which will include severe penalties for those who commit fraud. Clearly, the government is on the right track in protecting the integrity of our immigration system and the welfare of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813733">Canada's economic action plan is working. Job protection and creation are Canada's top priorities. That is why we have continued to weather the economic storm with Canada's economic action plan. This plan is working in Richmond. Tax dollars are being prudently invested in projects that will benefit the public, such as making people's commutes on Highway 99 quicker with the bus lane expansion, or ensuring people's water and sewage systems are maintained to the excellent standards in one of the cleanest urban watersheds in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813734">The people of Richmond and the neighbourhood will also continue to enjoy a better life resulting from other projects, such as improved community centres and swimming pools, the green pathway on the dike and the library of the Kwantlen Polytechnic University to name just a few. Besides the public sectors, industries and businesses are starting to hire. Jobs have been created and the numbers will keep growing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813735">I cannot refrain from talking about the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Games. Richmond was an Olympic host city and is the location of the Olympic Oval, a world-class long track speed skating venue. We have welcomed the world and boasted with the Canada Line. Our airport, the YVR, also world class, is the most accessible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813736">Canada was witness to athletic excellence and Canadian athletes inspired us all with their determination and skill. The Canadian Paralympic curling team is skipped by Jim Armstrong, who is currently joined by another Richmond resident, Darryl Neighbour, on the team. Also, Richmond is the home of Rick Hansen and Alexa Loo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813737">However, we cannot rest on our accomplishments. We must continue to build our skills for future competitions. I am not only referring to athletic competitions, but the competition of other hands and minds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813738">Now I would like to comment on job creation and fostering the next generation of working Canadians. In the throne speech, Her Excellency aptly pointed out that, “The success of Canada’s economy depends on a skilled and educated workforce”. In order to be a world-class economy, we must be educated and trained. Being competitive in today's economy means having the skills and training to adapt to a dynamic global market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813739">The government believes in fostering an environment for our people to excel at home, and it is evident that we walk the talk. The government has never ceased to invest in the growth of our people through providing grants, tax credits, apprenticeships and support for training programs so Canadians can obtain the skills and training they need to achieve their goals and dreams. Under Canada's economic action plan, this government allotted $1.9 billion to enhance the availability of training, an investment made toward short and long-term skill training or upgrading for workers of all fields and expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813740">The government also recognizes the need to give young people a hand to help them smooth out the transition from the campus to the workplace. Especially in our recovering economy, this transition might not be easy for many young Canadians. According to Statistics Canada, the youth unemployment was 15.1%, the highest of any age group. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813741">Young people have a tough time finding jobs to get themselves through school or sustain their livelihood after they are done with school because of the global recession. This government has set in place several programs to bridge the way for young Canadians to enter the job market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813742">To give an example, the existing career focus program provides wage subsidies of up to $15,000 to businesses and non-profit organizations to hire high school graduates. Another example is the $20 million two year targeted funding delivered through the Canada summer jobs program, an incentive for employers to hire summer students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813743">The games have amazingly united Canadians and fostered our national pride. What lies ahead is to continue to make Canada the best place in the world we all call home.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128862" Type="18">Mr. Rick Dykstra (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1813755">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity that has been given to me by the <Affiliation DbId="128873" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary for Multiculturalism</Affiliation> by sharing her time with me. She is doing an outstanding job on behalf of this government. Her riding is in British Columbia but her travels with respect to multiculturalism have taken her across this country. For a member who was just elected a little over a year ago, she is doing an outstanding job for our government, and I applaud her for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813756">The response to the throne speech which the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave on March 11 focused on what we need to do as a government and what this Parliament will focus on, with jobs and economic growth remaining our top priorities. In order to deliver on jobs and economic growth, three specific things were outlined in both the throne speech and in the Prime Minister's reply to the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813757">The first was tax reductions and enhanced EI benefits, which will provide direct support to Canadians. Let us not forget that the success of our long-term economic strategy is based on short-term stimulus funding. It is also based on tax reductions, both corporate and personal, to make us more competitive from a corporate and personal perspective. This will leave Canadians with more money in their pockets and the ability to spend that money as they wish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813758"> Individuals who are unemployed, hopefully only for the short term, are going to see enhanced EI benefits. These enhanced benefits will provide direct support to Canadians right across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813759">The second thing the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> mentioned was infrastructure programs in partnership with the provinces, territories and municipalities across the country. Twelve thousand projects are under way. Those 12,0000 projects represent a direct investment in our communities, putting people to work and laying the foundation for prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813760">From a local perspective I have to look no further than the Applied Health Institute at the Welland campus of Niagara College, which is in a riding not held by a member of our party. It is located in a riding held by a member of the New Democratic Party, a member who voted against the 2009 and 2010 budgets. The Applied Health Institute represents an investment of $20 million from the federal government, $20 million from the provincial government, and $20 million from Niagara College. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813761">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and I were able to tour the institute earlier this year. We toured the construction sites. This institute is going to change the face of the college for years to come. It will change the face of the Niagara community just based on its long-term focus as a health institute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813762">At Brock University, construction is well under way of the bioresearch facility,110,000 square feet of research space, of incubator space. This will create the types of long-term jobs that will contribute to the success of the Niagara community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813763">The third thing the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> addressed was economic growth. We have to make sure that we regain our economic form within the G20 and the G7. Businesses are hiring again. Just last month 20,000 new jobs were created in this country. Close to 160,000 net new jobs have been created over the last eight months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813764">This speaks very well for the future of our strategy. This speaks very well for where the budget that was most recently introduced in the House is going to take us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813765">We are planning for recovery. We are planning to wind down our stimulus plan by March 31, 2011. Let us not forget the purpose of the two year stimulus funding. Our stimulus plan put $19 billion back into the Canadian economy. It was very specific. It was a short-term approach to make sure that people were getting back to work during the recession. However, to be responsible, we need to make sure that those projects are completed on time and on budget. We need to make sure that they lead us out of the stimulus funding program and back into a situation where we have not just recovered from an economic perspective, but that our finances are back in the black. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1813766">We also want to ensure that we are restraining federal spending. It is important to understand that as outlined in the throne speech, the 2010 budget is all about making sure that we have complete fiscal control of the federal budget and federal spending, but we are not going to do it in the way the previous government did in the 1990s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813767"> We are not going to cut transfer payments on education. In fact, over the last five budgets, each and every year we have seen a federal government which has invested in education in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813768">We are not going to reduce transfer payments with respect to health care to the provinces and territories, as happened in the 1990s under the previous government. We believe the provinces have the responsibility for the delivery of health care and the federal government has the responsibility for ensuring that we help cover the costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813769">There has been a lot of talk by the opposition and the government about pensions. We are not going to reduce pensions. We are going to make sure that the funds are there in order to cover the costs for the pensions that we are responsible for at the federal level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813770">Third and most important, we are going to focus on the continued growth of our economy. We need to build the jobs and the industries of the future. We recognize that to ensure long-term growth, the private sector needs to grow, and in order to grow, businesses need to make sure they are competitive. That is why by 2015 we will have the lowest corporate tax structure in the G7, which will make us that much more competitive. The corporate offices of Tim Hortons is just one example of companies that are coming back to Canada and have recognized that it is a wise and solid investment and a wise and solid business decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813771">That is why we will continue to invest in infrastructure across this country, whether it be bridges, buildings, roads or sewers. Where our responsibilities are, in partnership with the provinces, territories and the municipalities, we will ensure that we are ready, that we are targeted for growth and understand the need for solid infrastructure. This is what individuals base their decisions upon with respect to their private lives in terms of where they are going to live and raise their children, where their families are going to grow. It is also an opportunity for corporations and businesses to understand that this is a country that is ready and willing, when it comes to infrastructure, to partner with them to grow their businesses in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813772">That is why we are creating the conditions for economic growth through lower taxes and a stable investment climate. We have the strongest banking system in the world. We have the strongest economy coming out of the recession. We are making the tough decisions to ensure that when the recovery is in full swing, Canada will be in first place, just as we were with respect to our gold medal total at the Olympics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813773">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also outlined three additional issues in his response to the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813774">First, we will ensure that Canada is the best place for families. We will support families and communities and keep our streets and our communities safe by continuing to get tough on criminals and to get tough on crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813775">Second, we are going to ensure that from a national perspective, we will safeguard our national security. We will stand up for those who helped build Canada, because Canadians believe that sacrifice and hard work should be recognized. As we strive to create an even better future for our families and communities, our government will stand up for those who built and defended their communities and this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813776">The Speech from the Throne also made clear that Canada's military mission in Afghanistan will come to an end in 2011. The throne speech outlined that our efforts will focus on humanitarian aid and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813777">Finally, we will strengthen a united Canada in a changing world. We will protect our unparalleled natural beauty. We will be asserting our sovereignty in the north. We will recognize our aboriginal heritage. We will stand up for what is right in this world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813778">The throne speech identified the importance of our economy, identified the importance of families in our country, and identified our country's role in this world. I am proud to say that the throne speech is a great foundation upon which this government is going to build over the next number of months and years.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1813779">Madam Speaker, I listened very carefully to the parliamentary secretary. There is one comment I want to make and one question I want to ask him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813780">With respect to health care, he talked about what the government did. What he is neglecting to say, and it is unfair, is that it provided nothing in any additional money. For the record, the money that is being transferred is the 2004-05 allocation of $56 billion by a Liberal government over a 10-year plan. He can even read the paper today. It confirms it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813781">He said that the government wants to keep more money in the hands of Canadians. I agree with him. We can do it by reducing taxes. I want to ask him a question about page 52. His <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that taxing on jobs is a killer. We agree. That is why we were reducing EI benefits over so many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813782">I will ask him to read page 52 of the budget. It shows that between 2000 and 2006, when the Liberals were in government, EI premiums were going down and then it kind of froze. According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the government is going to be raising EI premiums to the tune of $13 billion. That is taking money out of people's pockets. How can he justify that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813783">Madam Speaker, I happen to agree with the member opposite when he stated that his government actually reduced EI benefits during its time in government. That is exactly what he said and he is right. For the record, I think it would be important for him to read his comments in <I>Hansard</I> after, because it certainly points out that his government did nothing for those who needed assistance during the recession while his party held government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813784">However, let me state very clearly for the record that it was his government and finance minister that decided that the best way to balance the budget and find savings was not to work hard here in Ottawa. It was simply to cut health transfers to the provinces and territories, of which they are finally starting to recover in this country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1813785">Madam Speaker, there are a couple of issues I have with the member's speech. He said that Canada has a strong banking system. It is largely recognized that that is the case. That is what has probably saved us from the mess that we see in the United States right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813786">However, we should know here that the government had absolutely nothing to do with that. As a matter of fact, if it had had its way, it would have been deregulating the banking system in the race to the bottom following George Bush. It was the previous government and the oppositions at the time that forced the previous government to not allow a consolidation of the banks or regulations. The government is simply benefiting by something that was actually kept in place by the previous government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813787">Let us deal with the issue of corporate tax reductions. The Conservatives once again think that they can race to the bottom on corporate tax reductions and that we are somehow going to have a better economy because of it. The evidence is just not there. Statistics Canada said that business spending on machinery and equipment has actually declined.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813788">Madam Speaker, I can barely rise to respond to that question because I am blown away that a member from the fourth party in the House, the NDP, is actually defending our banking system. He is defending the banking industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813789">It is good to see this morning, because every time members of that party stand up, they are trying to strip down a system so that it does not have the ability to do what it did during this time of recession. In fact, it helped this country and led this country to ensure that we are not in the position of one of our North American partners and certainly other partners around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813790">We are talking about the reduction of corporate taxes. We are thinking and moving toward ensuring that corporations have a competitive advantage to do business in this country and to ensure that when companies from outside of this country want to invest, they are going to look to Canada because they know we are competitive, aggressive, and a good place to do business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813792"> Today I am going to talk about a subject that is perhaps not immeasurably important, but that is still very important, since it concerns the government’s intention, as expressed in the Speech from the Throne, to abolish the firearms registry, at least for long guns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813793"> This intention on the part of the government has mobilized a lot of people in my constituency. I have met with several crime prevention organizations, since this is one prevention tool that fits perfectly with Quebec’s philosophy on crime. The Conservative philosophy revolves exclusively around enforcement and punishment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813794"> I have also met with women’s organizations. This is a question of very particular concern to them, because unfortunately, most victims of spousal violence are women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813795"> I have met with the mayors and police chiefs in my riding. Everyone agreed that something had to be done to block the government’s intention of abolishing a tool that is widely used by police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813796"> Then I went out to see the people in my riding. I spent time at a lot of metro stations. My urban constituency has eight metro stations, and you can meet a lot of people there. A petition was circulated that I have tabled in the House; 1,500 names were collected in a few days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813797"> That figure has to be put in perspective: those names were collected in my riding alone, in a few days. That is huge; there was enormous enthusiasm. It was unbelievable; people were lining up in the metro stations to sign the petition. They clearly care about the firearms registry. This is a visceral issue in Quebec, because it came out of the terrible tragedy at the École Polytechnique.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813798"> I tabled the petition in the House on March 8, International Women’s Day. This is very much a question that concerns and affects women in particular. The firearms registry has been particularly useful in relation to spousal tragedies and murders committed with long guns, a factor that the Conservative government wants to dissociate itself from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813799"> The other reason why women in Quebec, and feminist Quebeckers, are greatly concerned about preserving the firearms registry is of course the event that led to the registry: the terrible tragedy at the École Polytechnique de Montréal. That tragedy was the height of misogyny and cowardice; an individual who held women responsible for all his misfortunes and probably for his own mediocrity took the cowardly step of murdering 14 young women with a firearm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813800"> Those women, in the flower of their youth, were murdered with a weapon that the Conservatives want to remove from the firearms registry: a Ruger Mini-14. This is adding insult to injury for all the women who made this the fight of their lives and who decided to take this tragic event and create something out of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813801"> The firearms registry is the legacy of the victims, the survivors and the families of the victims, who did battle to ensure that Canada, like most countries in the world, would have a firearms registry. We have to be honest when we come to this debate, and talk about the real numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813802"> I am often surprised to see the adversaries—and the Conservatives in particular—send the debate right off the rails. It is sort of like a pirate hijacking a vessel. The Conservatives are acting like pirates by taking the debate hostage and saying any old thing and its opposite.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1813803"> I offer as evidence the response we often hear from the Conservatives. They say that, in any case, most crimes, murders and homicides are not committed with long guns, but with handguns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813804"> From a statistics standpoint, they are not entirely wrong. In 2007, 67% of homicides were committed with handguns as opposed to 17% with shotguns or hunting rifles. What they failed to say, however, was that in 1997, in the early days of the gun registry, the proportion was significantly different. Handguns were involved in 50% of murders, while shotguns or hunting rifles were involved in 39.9%—over twice as many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813805"> Where the gun registry was most useful and had the greatest impact was in the case of shotguns and hunting rifles The figures show that it was with these weapons that the registry had the greatest impact. It had less impact in the case of handguns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813806"> The government is proposing to eliminate the most useful and effective part of the registry, the one that has had the greatest effect in statistical terms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813807"> They are constantly giving out false information and fear-mongering. This is like Halloween, but without the pumpkin. There is nothing funny about this. They are frightening hunters by telling them that they will be treated like criminals if they are caught in the woods without a registration certificate, will have a criminal record and will no longer be able to travel. That is totally ridiculous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813808"> This is not at all the case. An individual carrying an unregistered weapon will have it confiscated and have a few days to get it back it by submitting a registration certificate. It is a little embarrassing, but there have to be consequences when people fail to respect the law. In any case, it is far less serious than when people forget their vehicle registration, which leads to a hefty fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813809"> We must cut the Conservatives off at the pass. They will not change their mind, because they are short-sighted on this matter. Two men can block their path and we must convince them to do so. They are the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition </Affiliation>and the leader of the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813810">And when I say Leader of the Opposition, I mean the leader of the Liberal Party. The Bloc Québécois voted unanimously against this bill. Last week, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> asked the leader of the NDP a question. He tried to shake off the question like one would try to shake a dog off one's leg. That impresses no one. I am not comparing my colleague to a dog, of course. I am using that analogy to explain what the NDP and the Liberals think of this issue. I am sure that my colleagues understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813811">These two leaders have to stop with their doublespeak, have the courage of their convictions and take measures to stop the Conservatives in their tracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813812">I will finish by speaking about the importance of the gun registry. During my 10-minute speech, the registry was consulted by police nearly 70 times. They did not consult the registry because they had nothing better to do. They took the time to consult it nearly 70 times since my speech began because it is useful to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813813">As parliamentarians, we have to trust the police, respect the memory of the victims at the École Polytechnique and all of those who have been abused since then, and establish a gun registry. We have to show political courage and vote against the government bill and the Speech from the Throne, which would get rid of the gun registry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813832">Madam Speaker, I will begin by making a clarification. I did not say that the Liberal Party was against the gun registry. I said that the leader should show some courage and impose the party line on his caucus in order to block the Conservatives. Otherwise, it is far too easy to say, in ridings where it is popular, that the leader is for the gun registry, and then meet with groups in other ridings where it is less popular and say that as an individual member, he or she voted against it. This doublespeak is too easy and that is what I took issue with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813837"> The reason some members have risen on points of order today is that there is a fundamental problem. We seem to be discussing the menu after we have eaten the meal. We are discussing the Speech from the Throne today, but the budget has already been passed, in collaboration with the Liberal members who were careful not to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813838"> I can never say it often enough: when it comes to a throne speech or a budget, the Bloc Québécois does its homework. Once again, it has done it. The Bloc held consultations to clearly identify the needs and aspirations of Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813839"> In both the throne speech and the budget, there are two groups that have been seriously overlooked: the overlooked poor and the overlooked rich. Some of the overlooked have specific needs, whether in terms of social housing or employment insurance—the people who are not entitled to it and the people whose benefits could be improved or who could have greater access to them. The overlooked also include older workers who have specific needs and seniors whose guaranteed income supplement puts them at or below the poverty line. A host of needs have not been met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813840"> At the same time, some of the overlooked are wealthier. The government has overlooked the oil companies, which enjoy enormous exemptions and which should be making a greater social contribution. It has also overlooked the beneficiaries of tax havens. Billions of dollars are being allowed to go somewhere other than the economies of Canada and Quebec. Workers have also been overlooked, because they are not being taxed fairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813841"> Today, I hope to have time to address a few very specific issues. I would like to discuss the Canadian apparel and textile industries program, funding for the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, the community access program, broadband access technologies and telecommunications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813842"> Let us start by talking about the Canadian apparel and textile industries program, formerly called CANtex. A company in my constituency has had an opportunity to become better known, as we can read in <I>Les Affaires</I> for the week of March 13 to 19. In spite of the situation that has prevailed in the apparel and textile industry for years, FilSpec has succeeded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813843"> When I first came to the House, we were well aware that industry was having major and fundamental problems that had to be addressed. Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives were up to the job. We will recall that in the case of apparel and textiles, there was talk at the time of loan guarantees. There was talk, just as there had been talk about research and development and investing more money in CANtex. Fortunately, at least a little money was invested. When I say “a little”, that is putting it mildly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813844"> An analysis of the budget and the 2009-10 estimates spending reveals that the government's contribution under the Canadian apparel and textile industries program was $4.513 million. Members will say that that is not much and indeed it is very little. At the time, we called for an increase in the amount, but the government did not do its job. We are now faced with the events in the apparel and textile industry. Endless job losses have hit ridings such as mine and that of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128168" Type="2">Compton—Stanstead</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813845"> The government would do extremely well to provide sufficient funding again.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1813846"> I will speak briefly about the comments in the journal <I>Les Affaires</I> between March 13 and 19, 2010, which I mentioned earlier. It stated that competition from emerging countries in the textiles sector was threatening the survival of FilSpec. The result is that this firm specialized in the production of high-tech yarns for very specific applications. The survival of these so-called soft industries depends on innovation and thus on research and development to establish a very specific niche. Even though they may not have huge production, they have a niche with an international clientele. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813847"> Unfortunately, at certain times, the Canadian dollar increased hugely, creating export problems. Programs such as CANtex helped businesses export as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813848"> To demonstrate the capabilities of the firm, the author asked whether they could one day create a material that, like Harry Potter's magic cape, would make its wearer invisible. The president, Ronald Audet, did not say no. Moreover, his firm has almost met this challenge, because, for the Canadian army, the plant developed a yarn that goes into the manufacture of clothing that cannot be detected by infrared light. There are also antimicrobial yarns for the health sector and flame retardant yarns for firefighters. The plant is located in Sherbrooke and specializes in high-tech yarns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813849"> I will end my reference to the journal, but I wanted to point out the importance of innovation. The government says that research and development is everything and that the future belongs to innovation, but it does not put its money where its mouth is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813850"> Nothing is created, nothing is lost. It is a simple equation. World exports equal world imports. That is an absolute. So eventually, when there is a level playing field, the only thing that will set economies apart is not the exploitation of badly paid workers abroad or the exploitation of the environment or the social fabric of other countries, but innovation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813851"> The government invests in certain sectors, but it invests more or less in other vital sectors. The manufacturing industry is a source of jobs that must not be abandoned, because the best hope of creating jobs is in high-tech and innovative manufacturers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813852"> I recall that not so long ago—in 2009—my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128305" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> asked a question regarding CANtex in the House. He said it was important to continue the program to enable the textile industry to become more competitive and develop its markets. Unfortunately, the Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec) responded rather vaguely, providing absolutely no reassurance for the members of the industry that includes FilSpec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813853"> In terms of innovation, the government is trying to eliminate the paper burden as much as possible. So it is asking the public to use the Internet. Unfortunately, to all intents and purposes, no mention is made of the community access program. It will therefore likely be eliminated. Yet we need it. Even the government, in its aim to reduce the paper burden, should keep it because all departments are asking us to work with the Internet and download forms from it. </ParaText>

This being the first opportunity I have had to address the House in this third session, I want to start by thanking the people of <Affiliation DbId="128543" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> for giving me the tremendous honour to serve them here and at home as their member of Parliament.</ParaText>

Their stories and their history, their aspirations and their struggles, it makes me want to get up every day really early and go to work for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813877">There are many that I could mention, but by way of example I think of a constituent in the township of Ramara who is devoted to expanding political discourse in our country, a man by the name of Ken Szijarto. He is a man with a young family who expects, in fact demands, only the very best from his elected officials who represent him and why should he not? On controlling spending, on accountability, on keeping taxes in check, people like Ken hold our feet to the fire each and every day. Where would we be without constituents like him?</ParaText>

I would also like to thank Ms. Danielle Prince, the history and politics teacher at Midland Secondary School for actually assigning her grade 12 politics class to attend one of my town hall meetings. Those meetings gave me a closer sense of what my constituents expect as we tackle this post-recession period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813885">The Speech from the Throne highlighted how important and urgent it is for us to complete our economic action plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813886">We are starting to climb our way back up after falling at the end of 2008. Our government's measures over the past year have paved the way to a stronger economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813889">The measures we are taking in our jobs and growth budget will move to further that economic success. Along with the commitment to completing the economic action plan in its second year, the Speech from the Throne ushers in a plan to return to a balanced budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813890">Canadians know and accept that the deficit budget was necessary, but they are just as convinced that we must return to balance in a reasonably short time. They know this from their own experience, in their household and in their business. Borrowing temporarily for an unexpected financial pressure is acceptable provided we get back on track as the financial urgency eases. Our government is following the same course.</ParaText>

Slaying the deficit, balancing the budget and resuming regular payments toward the national debt in the not too distant future are not an end in themselves. They are the way forward for a stronger Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813894">Just as we are proud of what we have accomplished, we also realize there is much more to do. The Speech from the Throne outlines the kind of Canada we aspire to have, a Canada that is building the jobs and industries of tomorrow, mustering the best minds, technologies and resources to create jobs, growth and opportunity, bolstering our science and technology strategy to take full advantage of a digital economy and opening up new markets for our producers, manufacturers and service providers and strengthening trade with our biggest trading partner, the United States. We are improving the way we do business for our energy, mineral and power producers, while protecting our environment, and finding new and better ways for our agriculture, fisheries and forestry producers to build their businesses, invest and succeed in the best economy in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813895">It is a Canada putting families first by protecting the health and safety of our foods and consumer products, preventing accidents that harm our children and youth and ensuring the safety and security of our neighbourhoods by strengthening the laws and the sentencing of criminality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813896">It is a Canada, as the speech remarks, whose people are rooted in their history and institutions. Our history includes our indigenous people, the first people of this land.</ParaText>

I have had the opportunity to listen carefully to the hopes and struggles of Canada's aboriginal people. The Canada we envision through the throne speech recognizes the contribution of aboriginal people in building the country we inhabit together. Young aboriginal people in Canada particularly, who number proportionately larger than their non-aboriginal counterparts, will be a great source of inspiration and prosperity for their families and communities in the years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813898">We have a lot to be proud of, how, after shouldering the toughest economic downturn since World War II, we are coming to grips with Canada emerging stronger than when we went in. We should celebrate that, of course, but we must consider what that means in human terms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813899">In my riding, it means people are going back to work. It means college enrolment is up 30%. We are seeing people with a tremendous degree of optimism buoyed only by the tremendous show of national pride we saw from our athletes, visitors and fans at the Olympics and Paralympic Games in Whistler and Vancouver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813900">This rekindled civic spirit, the hope and optimism about Canada also lays down a marker for what Canadians expect their governments. Almost to a person, they are quite willing and able to do the heavy lifting in their own lives and occupations, but they sure want to know that we here in Parliament have their backs and are working just as hard beside them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813916">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be in the House today. I sincerely believe that the Speech from the Throne and budget 2010 are mindful of Quebec, as they are of all the other provinces and all the territories in this great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813917"> The Speech from the Throne lays out the government’s broad priorities—priorities that are faithful to Canadian values and that focus on what is most important to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813918"> The budget sends a clear message: Canada has returned to economic growth following the deepest recession since the 1930s. This budget aims to contribute to this recovery and sustain Canada’s economic advantage. To do that, the budget contains measures in three broad areas. I am going to review them, because it is useful to reiterate them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813919"> First, under year 2 of Canada’s economic action plan, the budget provides for federal stimulus measures totalling $19 billion, complemented by $6 billion from provinces, territories, municipalities and other partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813920"> Second, the budget invests in a limited number of new, targeted initiatives to create jobs and stimulate economic growth for tomorrow. The budget is based on innovation and makes Canada a destination of choice for businesses wanting to make new investments. This will all have tangible effects on Canada as a whole, including Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813921"> Third, budget 2010 provides for a three-point plan that will bring Canada’s finances back to balance after the economic recovery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813922"> The priorities of this government focus not only on every province and every territory, but on every Canadian. This is particularly true when it comes to the environment, in areas that are of concern to Canadians, like water pollution, protecting wildlife and plant life, and, of course, climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813923"> The government’s position on the environment is very clear: we are going to find a balance between economic priorities and environmental priorities. We are going to be proactive in our stewardship of our spectacular natural treasures, and we will preserve them so we can pass them down to future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813924"> Budget 2010 provides for over $190 million in new measures to support a cleaner, more sustainable environment and to continue to achieve Canada’s climate change objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813925"> Among those measures are the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813926"> A $100 million investment over four years to support clean energy generation in Canada’s forestry sector, through the next generation renewable power initiative. This investment will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by developing, marketing and implementing new clean energy technologies in the forestry sector, including biofuels, renewable electrical power and chemicals from forest biomass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813927"> Eligibility for accelerated capital cost allowance for clean energy generation equipment will be expanded to include heat recovery equipment and distribution equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813928"> Sixteen million dollars over two years to continue to implement the government’s action plan to protect the Great Lakes by cleaning up areas where the environment has suffered the most degradation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813929">Thirty-eight million dollars over two years for Canada’s invasive alien species strategy to reduce the risk of invasive animal and plant species flourishing in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813930"> Up to $11.4 million over two years to deliver meteorological services and navigation services in the north, to meet Canada’s commitments to the International Maritime Organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813931">Height million dollars over two years to support community-based environmental monitoring, reporting and data collection in the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813932"> Also, $18.4 million over two years for the preparation of the government's annual reports on key environmental indicators, such as air and water cleanliness and greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813933"> These new resources build on the sustained investment that began with Canada's economic action plan to make our economy more viable and strengthen Canada's position as a clean energy superpower. This investment includes the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813934"> One billion dollars over five years for the clean energy fund. This fund supports research and development for clean energy systems and demonstration projects, including carbon capture and storage initiatives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1813935"> One billion dollars over five years for the green infrastructure fund. This fund is intended to support priorities such as the production and transportation of sustainable energy and carbon transmission and storage infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813936"> Three hundred and eighty million dollars allocated exclusively to the ecoenergy retrofit—homes program, which encourages Canadians to make their homes more energy efficient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813937"> In 2009, the government also allocated $1 billion over three years to the pulp and paper green transformation program. This program provides incentives for pulp and paper mills to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and become leaders in the production of renewable energy from biomass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813938"> We understand very well that the growing exploitation of our resources requires us to make more enlightened environmental choices than ever before. We are therefore committed to take effective international measures to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813939"> The Copenhagen agreement was a big step forward. It laid the groundwork needed to get all the major greenhouse gas emitters to act to reduce their emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813940"> The agreement represents a turning point for Canada and for all the other countries committed to implementing it effectively. It is the first detailed global agreement on climate change. It is the first global agreement under which the principal greenhouse gas emitting countries quantified their commitment to reduce their emissions. They include the United States, China and India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813941"> We have to work to turn these political commitments into a binding treaty. This will be the focus of the negotiations this year. To advance these negotiations, Canada will pursue its active and constructive dialogue with its national, continental and international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813942"> As stated in the throne speech, we will also honour the financial commitments we made under the agreement. Canada will release funds to help developing economies reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. Canada's <Affiliation DbId="128695" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> is holding talks with our international partners to establish the level of contribution per country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813943">Our desire to harmonize our climate change policy with that of the United States goes well beyond greenhouse gas reduction targets. We must continue to push for a process that would coordinate our respective regulations. Close collaboration has thus far led to excellent progress in the automobile, marine, aviation and biofuel sectors. However, we still have more work to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813944">Our approach to climate change is based on rigorous science. As we are all aware, this year is the International Year of Biodiversity, which is a fitting opportunity to reflect on our rich natural heritage and our duty to protect it. It would be remiss of me not to mention it. Canada is a leader on the international stage when it comes to biodiversity. We were the first industrialized country to ratify the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813945">Our government has invested significantly in biodiversity. From Darkwoods in British Columbia to the ecosystem in the greater Nahanni area of the Northwest Territories to Deep Cove, Nova Scotia and many other places in Canada, the government has taken measures to protect more than 100 million hectares of land—almost 10% of Canada's land mass—and 3 million hectares of ocean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813946">We have dedicated $275 million over five years to measures related to species at risk. We have also invested $225 million in conservation programs for natural areas. This investment played an important role in acquiring 122,000 hectares to protect the habitat of 79 species at risk. We invested $5 million in working with provincial and federal partners in order to find a solution to the issue of invasive alien species that are threatening the native fauna and flora.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813949">They seem to have forgotten. The parliamentary secretary is part of a government that has increased the national debt by $100 billion. Every Canadian is now on the hook for $3,000.

Before I continue, I appreciate the differences in our society and our economy but it is the vision we must learn from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813970">When the kingdom was established in 1932, education was available to very few people, mostly the children of wealthy families living in the major cities. Today, however, there are 25,000 schools, 11 universities, with an astonishing 22 more currently being built. Female students make up a little over half of the nearly five million Saudi school and university students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813971">Most recently in 2009, over 3,000 dignitaries from around the world attended the official inauguration of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, or KAUST. It came with an endowment of $10 billion and aims to be one of the world's great institutions of research, with partnerships with 27 universities, including Caltech, Harvard and Stanford in the United States, and Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College in the United Kingdom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813972">Government ministries, private companies, investors and the Saudi public all repeat the mantra of the 10x10 vision. Consequently, Saudi Arabia has shown significant improvements in the World Bank's Doing Business rankings over the last five years, leaping from 67th position in 2004 to 38th in 2006, 16th in 2007 and to 13th in 2009, ahead of advanced economies such as France, Germany, Japan and Switzerland.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1813979">However we cannot do it by destroying what makes us Canadian and in some cases uniquely Canadian. Let me take health care for example. Worldwide, we are now seeing major movement between public and private financing. Countries with a public financing scheme are trying to discover what the private sector might have to offer. Countries with the private sector, like Australia and the U.S., are looking to the public sector for advantages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813980">Today Canadian health care is at a crossroads. We must fix the system that served us so well for many years. We cannot let it slip away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813981">Thankfully, making improvements does not necessarily require higher spending. If we look at hospital costs across 10 OECD countries, we see wide variations. If unit costs could be reduced to the level of the best performers, average costs could potentially be reduced between 5% and 48%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813982">Opportunities for cost reduction include more emphasis on preventive medicine and the social determinants of health, such as early detection visits and mammograms. We know that diseases are cheaper to treat if they are caught earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813983">There are opportunities for better coordination. Problems can happen throughout health systems but most particularly at the barrier between primary, specialist, acute and long-term care. This is recognizing of course that we have a federal-provincial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813984">There are opportunities to reduce drug spending. For OECD countries, drug spending is annually increasing at 5.7%, outstripping growth for other types of health care and GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813985">While we work to meet this challenge, a tectonic shift is taking place in medicine. For the average patient the movement is subtle, but ultimately it will affect the entire landscape of health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1813986">Genomics will allow tomorrow's physician to predict in utero or at birth what major diseases a person is likely to develop. Vaccines will be created specifically to treat an individual person's cancer. Stem cells will be used to regenerate a specific tissue lost to disease or trauma.

              <ParaText id="1814004">Where was the investment in our seniors? Population aging has tremendous implications for Canada, where most elderly people would not be able to meet more than a small fraction of the cost of the health care they incur. The average hospital stay for our seniors costs $7,000, and that does not take into account emergency and cardiac care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814009">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to participate in the debate from the Speech from the Throne, although I should say at the outset that I find the debate, and I guess the whole Speech from the Throne, somewhat unusual and somewhat strange. A Speech from the Throne has a very long tradition in history, in our Commonwealth, in our western democracy system, under the Westminster system. Usually, it is the agenda of the government, read by Her Majesty the Queen, or in the case of Canada a representative of Her Majesty the Queen. It basically sets out what the government intends to accomplish over the term of the Parliament, or the session, and lays out a best-case scenario, if everything goes well, of what that government intends to accomplish. Of course it is read by a representative of Her Majesty the Queen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814010">This document is somewhat strange because this, as we know, is the third Speech from the Throne we have had in about 15 months. We did have a Speech from the Throne in November 2008. We had another one in February 2009. And now we have one in March of this year, and it really is not an agenda. It is not a vision. Basically, what I see it being is a list of certain items that are going on in the country, the crisis in Haiti and the Olympic Games, and it is a list of programs. I think the government went to every department and agency in Ottawa and asked for a list of what they have been doing over the last five years, and this has all been appended into the Speech from the Throne. It really does not give anything in the way of an agenda or a vision or what the government really intends to accomplish over the next session of this, the 40th Parliament of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814011">I am going to make the submission that there are a lot of issues facing Canadians. These are issues that I think should have been in the Speech from the Throne. They are issues that Canadians are talking about. Of course the first issue was the prorogation of this House, this assembly, that occurred back in December of last year. That is what they are talking about. They certainly would have liked to have seen something in the Speech from the Throne that would put some limits, some restrictions, on that right to prorogue this Parliament, this assembly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814012">Besides that, there are a number of other issues that I do believe warrant a public discussion, which should have been in the Speech from the Throne. The first issue I will mention is the whole demographic transition that the population of Canada is undergoing. We are becoming an older society. We have fewer children. There is a much higher dependency rate. There are fewer citizens under the age of 18 and a lot more over the age of 65, which of course increases our dependency rate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1814302">Mr. Speaker, when I started my remarks prior to question period, I said that this is a strange debate because there really is not anything in the Speech from the Throne that I would consider has anything to do with an agenda, a vision or futuristic programs. It is a compilation of things that might have been done in the last three or four years. It talks about the situation in Haiti and it talks about the Olympic Games, but really there is nothing there at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814303">There is probably a reason for that. This is the third Speech from the Throne in 14 months. It makes a mockery of the whole thing. Anyway, this is what is in front of us. There are several issues that we should be having a public discussion about and which should be in the Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814304">The first one is the major demographic transition that is going on in Canada which will have dramatic effects on our labour force, on our future health care costs, on our pensions, on our care of the elderly. There is no public discussion going on about that at all. Some think tanks are writing reports, and some of them are quite alarming, but in the Speech from the Throne and the budget, there is dead silence. I find that alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814305">That leads to the second point, and that is the whole issue of pensions. This has become a very important issue for Canadians from coast to coast. Statistics indicate that approximately two-thirds of Canadians do not have sufficient savings for their retirement. There were no proposals in the Speech from the Throne. There was nothing in the budget. I know that some discussions are going on and there is a lot of hiding behind this jurisdictional shield. The federal government has the power to convene and to show leadership. I am looking for leadership on this particular issue and I know that all Canadians are as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814306">As we look forward as a society with a declining workforce we have to look for greater productivity. Our productivity is substantially lower than that of the United States and it is falling lower. Forty per cent of all Canadians do not have the literacy and numeracy skills to compete in the knowledge economy. Nothing is being done about it. No leadership is being shown by the government. Very little leadership is being shown by any of the provincial governments. The universities are not involved in this issue. The community colleges seem to be ignoring it. It just does not get any public discussion anywhere. This issue will affect dramatically the future productivity of this nation. It is an issue that I thought would have been mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814307">Dealing with the issue of productivity, there are significant barriers to post-secondary education developing in Canadian society. A lot of high school graduates are deciding not to go to university or to a community college. Their decision is based upon income. They do not want to incur the significant debt that is required. That is becoming a determinant for people to go to university. The country will suffer because of that. That issue should have been included in the Speech from the Throne as we look at the business and agenda of this House going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814308">Perhaps the item that is most blatantly not in the Speech from the Throne is the whole issue of the environment and climate change. The Conservative government is in its fifth year of governing. There have been three environment ministers. There have been three plans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814309">The first environment minister's agenda was to create a made in Canada plan. Did we ever get it? No. Did we get anything done at all on the environment or climate change? No.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814310"> When she was dismissed, she was replaced with the second environment minister. His program was to bring forward very tough regulations so that the largest emitters in Canada would be regulated. Was this ever done? No, it was not done. Was anything ever done? No, nothing was done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814311">Then there is the third environment minister. His plan is to start a dialogue with the Obama administration. Has this dialogue started? We do not know. The other day he was reported in the press as saying that the dialogue may take two or three years, and in the meantime we cannot do anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814312">I, and I believe most Canadians, find it troubling that we can go from one year to two years to three years to four years and not do anything about climate change, other than suggest that at some point in time we are going to start a dialogue with the Obama administration.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814313">I know there is a certain percentage of Canadians who do not believe in climate change. They support the remarks of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that this is an unproven science and it is a socialist plot. However, the majority of Canadians do not support that thought. There should have been something in the Speech from the Throne dealing with environmental issues, dealing with climate change and dealing with a future agenda and programs that this country would expect to see from the government in power regarding the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814314">I come from the political ideology that I believe there is a positive role for the federal government to play. A country as large and as diverse as Canada cannot function if there is not a strong federal government. I am not seeing it, and I am certainly not seeing it in this Speech from the Throne. I really do not see anything. It is disappointing, but there is some explanation for it. This is the third throne speech in 14 or 15 months. That is probably one of the biggest issues that I would have liked to see in the Speech from the Throne, that is, the constant attacks on democracy and the institutions of democracy, such as this institution, Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814320">The member makes a very interesting point that a lot of countries, such as Germany, China and the United States, are really into developing the green economy. Most economists believe that is the future, that we have to transition from carbon-based fuels to alternate sources of energy. Technology is what is going to take us there. A lot of countries are ahead of us. Canada is not doing very much.

We know that tourism on both sides of the border has dropped off a lot since the imposition of the new passport regulations, and here we have the government wanting to introduce a new biometric passport when it cannot even get the old passport to work properly. It should be negotiating with the American government to have a reduction in the price of the passports on both sides of the border for a six-month period or perhaps a two for one promotion, anything to get the tourism business back on track along the border.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814324">Mr. Speaker, this is an important issue. The member is quite right. Over the past 6 to 10 years we have seen a dramatic decrease in the number of United States tourists coming to Canada. It is not just one issue that is behind it; there are a number of issues. There is the thickening of the border. There was the confusion over passports, do people need them, do they not need them. There is the marketing issue. There is the price. Another issue was the whole way the government handled the GST rebates for foreign visitors. Altogether this has led to a dramatic reduction, unfortunately, for our tourism industry. It is just not a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814325">This is one of those issues the government has backed away from because it thinks it is a provincial jurisdiction. I take the contrary point of view that this is very much a federal jurisdiction. The federal government ought to show leadership. It has the power to come forward with national strategies. It could be doing a lot more to assist our businesses in the tourist industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814327">Some months ago I was door knocking in the former township of Osgoode which is in the south end of the amalgamated city of Ottawa. I knocked on the door of a soldier who had just returned from Afghanistan. When left for Afghanistan, he left behind a five-day-old newborn with his wife and he went to serve out his mission in one of the most dangerous places in the world. He came back and applied for parental leave under the employment insurance system, and why would he not? The employment insurance program provides parental benefits to individuals who are adopting a child or caring for a newborn, which he was. The only problem is that during the time when he was risking his life overseas on our behalf, the period of eligibility for collecting parental benefits had expired. While he was sacrificing for us, the system expired the benefits he had paid for his entire life as a working Canadian through EI premiums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814328">It struck me as an incredible injustice that we could ask people first to pay into the employment insurance system with the promise that one day they might draw from it in order to extract the parental benefits that are part of the program and then send them into harm's way and tell them when they got back that the benefits for which they had paid would no longer be theirs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814329">I brought this matter to the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources</Affiliation> and she acted swiftly and decisively to have the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> put the following words into the budget documents:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814332">I want to thank that soldier who brought this concern to my attention. It is due to his work that we were able to identify this problem and fix it for soldiers who make similar sacrifices in the future. I thank him and I thank the House for giving the occasion to serve people like the gentleman on whose doorstep I learned of this problem. I hope that we can all put aside our differences on an issue as unifying as this one to help our soldiers and our families, to uphold the great pillars of what make our country so great: hard work, family, patriotism, sacrifice.</ParaText>

I guess if the government could offer some proof that this strategy actually works, more people may be converted to the idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814335">However, the government has simply reduced its corporate tax from 40% down to 15% over the last few years, while the Americans are still at around 35%. There is no need for our country to be that much lower than the United States, especially when corporate taxes in some of the Nordic countries are at 50%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814336">If there were results coming out of this, the government would have an argument, but Statistics Canada and Finance Canada have said that business spending on machinery and equipment has declined as a share of GDP. Kevin Lynch, former Clerk of the Privy Council and cabinet secretary, said that IT use by Canadian business is only half of the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814337">Despite Canadian corporate taxes, the productivity growth is actually worse.

We do not want to go down the American road of overspending and overtaxation, which is why we are lowering taxes. We cut the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%. We lowered income taxes, lifted hundreds of thousands of poor Canadians off the tax rolls altogether and brought in tax credits for kids sports, student textbooks, tradesmen tools and passenger bus passes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814341">Those are all tax measures that help middle-class, hard-working Canadians and the NDP voted against them. I notice that the NDP and the other coalition parties are now supporting a new tax on iPods that will hammer everyday Canadians who are simply trying to take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy music and culture.

              <ParaText id="1814349">Just over a year ago, I gave my maiden speech on budget 2009 just before it was passed by this esteemed House. After that vote, in a moment of reflection I stood outside the Centennial Flame and looked back at the beauty of Parliament's Peace Tower. As I phoned home to speak to my family, it struck me just how significant our role is in charting the future of our country and how important a strong Canada is in leading the way in a world that is beset by strife and chaos.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814351">I know that this throne speech, as well as budget 2010 that was passed last week, were crafted after an extensive consultation process.

              <ParaText id="1814354">The advice given to me from municipal councils and chambers of commerce was for a budget that continues with targeted stimulus spending, a budget that protects core spending and transfer payments and finds savings in departments through program reviews and the elimination of inefficient programming. The budget that we just passed, the second half of Canada's economic action plan, does exactly that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814355">I agree with the people of Red Deer that the needed investments in core public infrastructure and services that are being addressed through our economic action plan, coupled with the competitive tax regime promised in the throne speech, will give them the freedom to be innovative, productive and independent. It also gives them confidence that we will be able to restore our fiscal balance while still respecting the health and social transfers that our provinces, territories and municipalities so desperately depend upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814356">Red Deer has many economic advantages but it is not without challenges. A rapid growth rate during the past decade had strained infrastructure budgets by inflating costs for both labour and materials. Then, as the recession hit, we found that current investments were being put in jeopardy, capital had vanished and people had lost their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814357">However, our economic action plan has been able to help. Many people are taking advantage of new programs that were introduced, such as extended EI benefits and training, and will continue to do so with the new measures that our government has announced in this throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814358">Our government is also creating jobs by commissioning important infrastructure projects with the help of provincial and municipal governments. These partnerships have supported our investments with matching funds, thereby expanding the scope of the many job-creating projects that are helping Canadians all across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814359">Our government's commitment to communities through our economic action plan, stimulus funding, the Building Canada fund and RInC program have provided improvements to local recreational centres and infrastructure in the communities of Red Deer, Penhold, Innisfail, Sylvan Lake, Delburne and Bowden.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814361">Recently I was pleased to join my provincial and municipal counterparts to address the construction of pipelines underneath the Red Deer River. This infrastructure will allow for continued growth in the southeast corner of Red Deer and provide a sewer link between southern communities and the waste water treatment plant.</ParaText>

Our government has committed an extra $10 million in this initiative to assist these community level programs.</ParaText>

That was a time when 25% of the funding for health transfers was taken away from our communities, which was a mistake. It is very vivid in my memory. The government at the time more or less blamed the provinces for the difficulties that were taking place in health care, even though it had downloaded those problems to them. It is important we realize that manipulation of dollars coming into our communities is a serious concern when it comes to looking after our seniors. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814386">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814387">For the second time in a year, the Conservatives shut down the work of Parliament. We know they did it to avoid the very important issues of Afghanistan and what happened to detainees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814388">I was very proud to attend the anti-prorogation rally that took place in Vancouver on January 23. It was wonderful to see the young people who came out to the rally. Some people had not been to a political protest before, but they came because they absolutely did not buy the very flimsy and transparent reasons the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave for proroguing the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814389">Yesterday we debated the NDP motion to place limits on prorogation and prevent the abuses we have seen take place under the Conservative government. The NDP motion basically stated that if the House was to be prorogued for more than seven days, there had to be a resolution and vote in Parliament on the reasons for prorogation. I am very pleased the motion passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814390">The reason the House was prorogued for five weeks was the government was supposedly recalibrating its agenda and setting a new agenda, with promises to listen to Canadians. When we heard the Speech from the Throne and the budget, there was no other conclusion but to say that it did not come up with anything new. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814391">The things people in my community of Vancouver East need and have called for, whether it is child care reform, an end to homelessness, the need for affordable housing, protection for seniors or an end to the HST, none of those are included in the Speech from the Throne or the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814392">Several major organizations in Vancouver, child care groups like First Call: BC Child and Youth Advocacy Coalition, when asked in the prebudget consultations, made it very clear to “Give priority to federal tax and program spending that will increase Canada’s investment in early childhood development”. They pointed out that for every dollar invested in child care, we put something like $2.30 back into the economy. That is an important economic and social investment, which helps women in the labour force and families overall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814393">When we compare the economic investment and the positive results, consider that the OECD and UNICEF rank Canada dead last in the provision of early learning and child care. We should be ashamed of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814394">What did the Speech from the Throne and the budget produce in that regard? In terms of the Speech from the Throne, child care was mentioned exactly twice. Housing was only mentioned once compared to the crime agenda, which was mentioned 12 times. We begin to get a bit of a comparison of where the emphasis is by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814395">The only changes made in terms of anything to do with child care was a measly increase of $3.35 per week for the universal child care benefit. That will not create a single day care space, not in my riding, not anywhere else across the country. In fact, the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of BC called this measure one of the greatest failures, saying that the taxable $100 a month baby bonus “is NOT a child care program”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814396">This is a huge issue for working families. After housing in British Columbia, child care is the second highest cost facing B.C. families. That is astounding. I am going to speak about this in a couple of minutes. Housing is bad enough, but the second highest cost facing families is the cost of child care. In fact, $1,200 per month is the average cost of care for a child under three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814397">In 2010 a metro Vancouver family with a four-year-old and a two-year-old in full-time child care will pay $23,700 annually in fees. That is astounding. For the average working family, that digs a big hole in its pockets and monthly income. Even for the child care spaces that are available, there are huge waiting lists.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814398">Right across from my constituency office in Kingsway in Vancouver, the brand new Mount Pleasant Community Centre 3 Corners Child Care Centre was forced to shut down its waiting list. Why? It has over 400 names on the waiting list and it decided it did not want to give parents a false hope about getting their child into care when the list was already so long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814399"> That is a pretty dismal record. It really disturbs me that this daily reality that the average family faces around child care and housing was not even addressed in the throne speech or the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814400">I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about the housing issue. In my community of east Vancouver and the downtown eastside and in Vancouver generally, a crisis is taking place. I participated in some of the events during the Olympic period in Vancouver. For example, the Red Tent Campaign, which was organized by the Pivot Legal Society, had 500 emergency red tents established. A tent village was set up in a vacant lot on East Hastings Street that was to be used for parking for Vanoc vehicles because people were so desperate for housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814401">We and other groups appealed to BC Housing to help find people shelter so they could move out of the tents into appropriate space. About 70 people did secure housing, but there is still a number of tents sitting in that vacant lot, on the mud, waiting for a proper housing solution to come forward. It is so outrageous, in a country as wealthy was Canada, that the Conservative government cannot give housing a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814402">I have a housing bill, Bill <Document DbId="4327908" Type="4">C-304</Document>, which calls for a national housing strategy and for the participation of all levels of government. It has huge support across the country, from municipalities, from first nations, from housing organizations, from faith groups. I hope when the bill comes back to the House for report stage and third reading, it will go through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814403">I could not believe there was nothing in the budget for housing. People in the downtown eastside, students, seniors, even families making modest incomes cannot afford affordable housing, whether it is in Vancouver or metro Vancouver generally. This was a huge failure in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814404">It has been same with pensions. Our pension critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128487" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation>, has done a tremendous job in bringing forward the issue of pensions and the fact that people are getting ripped off in their private pension plans and that the public pension plan itself is not doing justice to people. Many seniors are living below the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814405">We know a modest investment of $700 million toward guaranteed income supplement payments would close the gap of poverty among seniors. It would be such a dignified and important thing to do. Did we see it? No. What did we see? Instead we saw the mad race to the bottom by the government giving away another $6 billion in corporate tax cuts that are scheduled for this year. It is the hypocrisy and contradictions. The people who actually need the help, who should be the priority in our country, are somehow left out on the margins in the cold. Yet these wealthy corporations are doing very well. We know the banks have doubled their profits, for example, but they still get these big corporate tax breaks. I just find it very shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814406">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> pointed out a few moments ago, how can the Conservatives live in good conscience with this kind of massive tax shift that is taking place?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814407">Another point is the Aboriginal Healing Foundation is coming to an end March 31. This is so important in my community. Groups like Healing our Spirit BC Aboriginal HIV/AIDS Society and the Indian Residential School Survivors Society have used this money to help with the healing process. Every day I see the impact of residential schools on survivors and what it means to people in my community. Why is this program coming to an end? Why was it not included in the budget for a further commitment? It is so essential to the respect and dignity of aboriginal people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814408">Mr. Speaker, I listened to quite a bit of what the hon. member had to say in her speech. She talked about the universal child care benefit, housing and taxes. I will comment on the housing piece of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814409"> I am assuming she read the budget. There was $1 billion again this year for affordable housing. Just a few weeks ago in my riding, we announced a number of projects for affordable housing and low income housing, renovations that are going to be done in New Brunswick. Just in the Fredericton area more than 300 units are going to be improved, which will help with energy efficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814410">She also talked about the universal child care benefit. It boils down to fairness. We have both rural and urban taxpayers in this country. The universal child care benefit allows all families, rural and urban, to pick their choice of child care. Some rural people do not have the opportunity to take advantage of some of these large daycare operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814411">How does the member believe it is fair for rural taxpayers to bear the burden for everybody else, as opposed to a fair system like the universal child care benefit?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814412">Mr. Speaker, is it not just so typical of a Conservative member to pit one group of people against the other and say we are going to make rural people pay for an urban program? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814413">The fact of the matter is that the Conservative so-called child care program has not created one single new child care space. It is an absolute failure in terms of addressing the urgent needs of families who need child care not only in urban areas but in smaller communities as well. Yes, parents should have a choice, but many parents want to choose a group child care setting because they understand the importance of early childhood development. For the Conservatives to pit one group of parents against another is truly shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814414">In terms of housing, that member should know that the money in the budget was already in the former economic stimulus plan. There is no new money. It is not an ongoing provision for affordable housing in this country. I will take him on a tour of the downtown east side if he wants, and he can see the crisis that is taking place there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814415">Mr. Speaker, I listened to our colleague talk about social housing. Basically, what was presented in the budget was already part of the 2009 economic action plan. What is there in terms of social housing, mainly targeting seniors and persons with disabilities, is good. However, there is nothing for low income families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814416">This is important because, as our NDP colleague mentioned, more and more people are living in poverty and facing hardship. And access to housing in larger cities is becoming increasingly expensive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814418">Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the hon. member's comments, because he is right. A housing-first policy is so fundamental to any anti-poverty strategy. If people do not have secure, appropriate, affordable, safe housing, there is very little else in life they can deal with in a proper way, whether it is going to school or work or dealing with issues they might have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814419">This idea that we need to ensure that all Canadians have appropriate housing, no matter where they live or who they are, to me is a fundamental human right. This budget failed on that score. The money that is there is a leftover from the previous year. There is no new commitment to housing, and there is no long-term commitment to housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814420">This goes back to a former Liberal government that cut out the federal government from the provision of housing. I will say that the homelessness we see on our streets today is a result of those disastrous decisions that were made more than a decade ago. That is what we are seeing not only in my community but in other communities. Unfortunately, the Conservative government has not made it better. It has only made it worse.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1814421">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to follow the member from British Columbia, who has made a fantastic speech on the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814422">I certainly will get into some of the negative aspects of the throne speech and the actions of the government, but at the beginning I think I should point out that we do see some positives in what the government has presented in the throne speech. For example, we are pleased that the government promised to investigate the murders of 500 aboriginal women. We are pleased that the government is concerned about workers affected by corporate bankruptcies. We are pleased about its help for military families. We are also pleased about the government's intention to endorse the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, its support for Obama's efforts on nuclear non-proliferation and its commitment to boost support for apprenticeships and skills training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814423">Having said that, throne speeches are often very vague and they are promises of what we are going to do in the future. Many times I have seen in the province of Manitoba that the same material keeps appearing in throne speech after throne speech over a number of years. The government never actually gets around to doing anything about it. Therefore I hope that in this case it is going to be different and that these points that we support in the throne speech are not only announced in the throne speech but are actually acted upon and dealt with over the course of the year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814424">There is a large number of issues coming out of the throne speech that I want to deal with. Unfortunately there is not going to be enough time in this particular speech to deal with all of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814425">However, I want to start out by talking about the whole issue of Canada-U.S. cross-border tourism. A couple of weeks ago, several members of the House were on a Canada-U.S. congressional visit. We had the member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128145" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> along. We attended the governors conference and after that we had some visitations with congressional members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814426">These are ongoing visits. I was involved with them for a number of years as a provincial MLA; perhaps I went down a dozen times. It seems sometimes that we are making some progress, and the next year when we visit we find that the progress we made has been reversed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814427"> We were meeting on a half-hour, individual basis all day long. I think we met with 40 people from Congress and quite a number of senators. One of the issues, among others, that we dealt with while we were there was that we made certain we got across to them the whole idea that cross-border tourism figures are down. They understand that too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814428">The issue is what we can do about it. We have lodge owners and fishing camp owners across the country who have seen the numbers and their revenues drop off a lot. We felt that government should be making it easier for people to cross the border, and one of the ways we can do that is by reducing the cost of passports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814429">The government should be making an extra effort on its part to do exactly that. U.S. citizens actually do not need a passport to get into Canada. They just need a passport to get back into their own country. The result is that when passport costs are so high, $80 per passport, a lot of people are unable to afford them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814430">We had a Congress person tell us, and the member would agree, that he multiplied the cost of the passports just for his own family. He said that is $400, and he might think twice before he makes that fishing trip to Manitoba or Ontario. This is a member of Congress. So what would the average person have to say about those sorts of costs?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814431">Clearly we have to get greater numbers of people holding passports on both sides of the border, and perhaps a two for one, a half-priced passport for six months, should be attempted to try to solve this problem.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814432">Instead, what we have is the government's talking about biometric passports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814433">The government saw this coming. It saw that the Americans were going to require passports. We were given at least a couple of years' warning on this. And the Province of Manitoba, and other provinces I believe, asked the federal government to intervene, to go to the passport office and have the passport office introduce, basically, an enhanced card so that people could go across the border for a visit to the United States. They were told they were on their own and they should develop their own card. So the Manitoba government has spent, I do not know, $13 million I think at this point developing its own card, duplicating the processes of the passport office and offering this card to people at $35 or $40. To be honest, it is not getting a big uptake at this point because people are saying that if they are going to pay $30 for a card that would just get them across the border, they may as well add another $30 or $40 to it and have a passport with which they could go across the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814434">By the government's dragging its feet and not forcing the passport office to deal with the program, we now have this cottage industry across the country with all these provinces and border states developing enhanced driver's licences, in a way competing with and duplicating what the passport office is already doing. Meanwhile, time is going by and the lodge owners are suffering as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814435">It is fine that the government is announcing it is going to look at biometric passports. But when it does not even have its existing system working properly, then I think that might be a pipe dream, at least for the short term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814436"> The Nexus program has been around a number of years. We spoke with a congress person who had not renewed his Nexus card. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814437">There just seems to be a plethora of programs, a lack of coordination, a lack of advertising, and a lack of understanding by the public out there as to how to get these programs. If people get a Nexus card, not only do they have to go through all the security and the applications but they can only use the card at certain borders. I have been told that, for example, the Nexus lane has next to nobody in it. There is a dedicated lane at the border for people with Nexus cards. But since very few people have the card, there is hardly anybody there. It is like the Maytag repairman sitting there, waiting for the next customer to come through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814438">That is no way to be running a country. That is no way to be facilitating business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814439">We all know that the bad guys are not going to go through the border. They are going to go around the border. For several years now, at every one of the Midwest legislators' conferences, I bring up this point and I get full agreement from pretty much everybody. People from North Dakota and South Dakota and anybody who understands the issue will tell us that there is a broad uninhabited expanse along the border, and bad guys cross there. They import liquor, cigarettes, drugs, guns and so on across the border. They fly them across the border. They do not line up at the border crossing. We have constrained ourselves, tied ourselves up in shackles and knots and made it a real chore for people to get across the border, and the bad guys just go around it. So we have all the good guys lined up at the border, and the bad guys are walking around the border. It is time for us to rethink this whole border issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814440">I do not think I have a lot of time to talk about these new airport scanners. The government is spending $250 million per scanner, I think it is, and the bad guys have already figured out that all they have to do is put the explosives in body cavities and they defeat the scanner. We do not have them installed yet, nor paid for, and yet they are already redundant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814441"> I am told that my time is up, but I would be happy to take any questions that any members have on this or any other topic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814446">Mr. Speaker, that is a very important point and the Americans are having that fight right now in the United States Congress. Most Canadians, Conservatives included, find there is a very big disconnect when they listen to Americans on health care, and even Conservatives find it hard to believe there could be these arguments from essentially the working class and poor in the United States that somehow we should have a private system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814447"> As I said, I really do not understand it, but I understand that the Democrats are getting together as we speak and that Congressman Kucinich just converted yesterday to the plan, and within a few days the American Congress will probably be passing a health care bill. We can only hope that over time the system will evolve more into the system we have in Canada, France, and in England since 1949 and other parts of the world, because the Americans certainly are out of step with the rest of the developed countries as far as health care is concerned.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1814453">Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise you that I will be splitting my time with my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128485" Type="2">Niagara West—Glanbrook</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814454">As the champion for seniors in this government, I am privileged to speak about how older Canadians will help fulfill the pledge in the Speech from the Throne to build a stronger Canada now and in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814455">Since coming to office, this government has taken a multifaceted approach to supporting older Canadians and it will continue to do so. It is no secret that Canada has an aging population. Indeed, one in seven Canadians today is over the age of 65, but in two short decades more than one in four Canadians will be a senior.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814456">This demographic shift will have a profound effect on Canadian society and, thanks to our superior health care and quality of life, Canadians now enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world. The sheer numbers of new seniors, however, will pose a challenge to the sustainability of our social programs and economy. We must be ready to meet the needs of an aging population and harness the energy and expertise of this invaluable resource for the benefit of all Canadians. I assure the House that we are working hard to be ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814457">Who are Canada's seniors? Are they people who spend most of their time travelling or on the golf course? Do they mostly stay at home, busy with family or perhaps caring for grand kids? Are they often engaged in their communities as volunteers or active in service organizations? Perhaps seniors simply change their work-life balance somewhat and are still engaged in the workplace to some degree. Are they individuals who now spend more time mentoring and coaching others, sharing their life lessons in various ways? Of course, seniors are all of these things and many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814458"> We must be careful not to impose preconceived ideas about seniors. That is why, as one of our first steps, this government created the National Seniors Council to help us understand both the concerns and aspirations of Canadian seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814459">Last year, the council held round tables across the country to gather evidence from seniors about two key issues: volunteering and positive aging. The council's report will increase our understanding of how seniors stay healthy, active, and engaged and continue contributing to society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814460">Certainly we already know that many seniors stay active through volunteer activities. In fact, studies show that seniors who volunteer put in more hours per year than any other age group. With the replacement value of all volunteer work in Canada priced at about $14 billion, the financial impact of seniors in our communities is very evident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814461">However, the value of their contribution goes beyond dollars and cents. Seniors benefit from building social networks and staying physically and mentally active, and others in society benefit, gaining fresh perspectives and the intangible wisdom that can only come from a lifetime of experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814462">To encourage positive aging, the Government of Canada provides $35 million each year to enable seniors to engage with each other and mentor younger Canadians. I am pleased to note that budget 2010 provides an additional $5 million per year for the new horizons for seniors program, bringing the total to $40 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814463">The Government of Canada has also undertaken several initiatives to enhance the financial security of seniors. Each year, more than four million seniors receive old age security benefits and three million receive a cheque from the Canada pension plan. In addition, the guaranteed income supplement provides extra support to seniors with little or no other income.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814464">We are proud that poverty among seniors in Canada has fallen from a rate of 21% in 1980 to less than 5% in 2007. That is one of the lowest rates in the world. To assist the lowest income seniors who want to increase their income level, we now allow them to earn up to $3,500 and still receive GIS. In addition, we have increased the age credit for more than two million modest income seniors in recent years. We also introduced tax free savings accounts and income splitting for Canada's pensioners. All told, we are providing over $2 billion in tax relief for seniors and pensioners, in addition to over $33 billion a year for OAS and GIS. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814465">We are continuing to work with the provinces and territories to further strengthen Canada's retirement income system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814466">One of the biggest expenses for seniors is the upkeep of their homes, yet many seniors want to stay in their own homes for as long as they can. The Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's renovation programs, offers financial assistance for low-income households, including seniors. These programs assist with home modifications and adaptations to allow seniors and persons with disabilities to live independently in their own homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814467">Under the affordable housing initiative, the federal government has committed almost $2 billion over five years to improve and build affordable housing and help the homeless. These programs benefit low-income Canadians, including seniors. The federal government also provides close to another $2 billion each year to support social housing, approximately one-third of which is occupied by seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814468">In Canada's economic action plan, we injected another $400 million over two years for the construction of housing units specifically for low-income seniors. New handrails in the bathroom may increase seniors' comfort levels in their homes, but safety issues go far beyond nuts and bolts. It is another hard truth that between 4% and 10% of seniors in Canada experience abuse of some kind, whether physical, financial or emotional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814469">Our government has dedicated $13 million over three years to help seniors and others recognize the signs and symptoms of elder abuse and to know how to get help. In addition to a national awareness campaign, we are also developing tools and resources to help front line professionals in the health, financial and justice sectors to deal with this issue. In this fiscal year, we have also invested in 16 different elder abuse awareness projects across the country through the new horizons for seniors program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814470">The Speech from the Throne also commits the government to create Seniors Day. This would become an annual occasion to honour the contributions of older Canadians and underscore how they continue to shape the fabric of our nation. Seniors Day would be a natural symbolic step for a government that has such a solid track record on seniors issues. It would allow us to celebrate the value that Canadian seniors add to our society and the respect and honour we want to give back to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814471">In closing, let me emphasize that seniors have helped build this country. They not only have our thanks and gratitude, but also our support. Their government is committed to working with them.</ParaText>

That one step further would be to double the GIS in this country to ensure that not one senior lived in poverty in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814473">I have talked to a number of seniors in my constituency who are on fixed incomes. Most of them are in their eighties and they cannot afford to live in their homes. They are in perfectly good health but they just need more money. They are not disabled. They do not fall under any of those sorts of programs. They just need enough money to pay their heating and electricity bills. Of course, now that Ontario has the harmonized sales tax, all of that is going to cost more.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814476">As I mentioned earlier, we have brought in a number of measures to assist such individuals. The OAS and GIS already provide an income level for seniors that is slightly above the low income cut-off level in our country. In addition, there are programs to assist them in maintaining their homes and, to some degree, retrofitting them for special needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814477">These programs, OAS and GIS, already contribute $33 billion a year to our seniors and we continue to monitor those levels. There was an increase in GIS in 2006 and the amount of GIS also rises each time the cost of living increases every quarter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814484">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak in response to the government's Speech from the Throne that was delivered by Her Excellency just a few short weeks ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814485">The speech conveyed a strong message to Canadians throughout the country as to how our government is delivering or guiding the nation through this global economic recession. In this way, I found the title of the speech rather appropriate in describing Canada as a stronger country with a stronger economy now and for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814486">While there have been a number of initiatives this government has been working on over the last few years, certainly one of the things I applaud that we have been doing is looking at some of the deficits we have in infrastructure in this country. It is important to know that it has been many years since there has been the kind of spending this government has done on infrastructure here in this country. It has been many years since the kind of money has been put into roads and bridges and buildings, and has been as significant as we have delivered in the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814487">One of the other things I find encouraging, as well, is the knowledge infrastructure that we continue to build. It has always been my thought process that we are going to move from the jobs of yesterday, and some of the jobs that we continue to struggle with, whether it be manufacturing. I know that my areas of Niagara and Hamilton have issues in terms of the steel production. We have issues in terms of some of the manufacturing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814488">I really believe that one of the things we are going to need to do as we move forward in the future is deal with this knowledge gap or deal with the commercialization of technology. Our government spends all kinds of money every year on R and D technology. It spends all kinds of money on a number of different initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814489">I believe that one of the things that is important if we are going to find those jobs of the future is the need to deal with how we can commercialize some of that technology. There were definitely measures in the budget that dealt with some of those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814490">First, though, I wanted to talk about some of the things that have been happening in my riding of Niagara West—Glanbrook, some of the things that have happened there and what my constituency has been able to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814491">As we look at what is going on, certainly small-sized and medium-sized businesses that form the foundation of my riding's economic makeup have risen to the challenge. Many entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the government's economic stimulus programs and have helped create hundreds of new jobs in their first year. Much of this money has been allocated to these businesses to address the needs of the future and to ensure viability in the years ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814492">Most recently a number of local businesses in my riding, in the community of West Lincoln, received low interest loans to help them grow. This funding will be of great help to these committed members of our community who are working hard to ensure that we emerge from this recession stronger than before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814493">On that point, I would like to highlight some of the headline investments that have been made to the great benefit of my riding's residents. Just before Christmas I had the opportunity to announce a joint federal-provincial investment of $12 million to fund the building of a new YMCA in Grimsby, in Beamsville, which will also work to benefit the surrounding communities of Lincoln and West Lincoln.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814494">Further to this good news, I am very pleased to see that construction will start very soon and will create additional jobs for my community. I know we are all well aware of and familiar with the many benefits that come from a YMCA, not only from the point of view of families but the sense of community, as well as the fitness centre. I believe that my constituents are all very excited about the prospect of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814495">We have seen other local infrastructure in my riding that have very real benefits, including dollars that will be flowing to Pelham, Fonthill, West Lincoln and Grimsby to assist with everything from major road construction to revitalization of the entire downtown core in Pelham.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814496">Just last Friday my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128598" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation>, was in Hamilton announcing $200 million that is going to go for waste water. If we think about that and the kind of project that involves, towns and cities just do not have that kind of money. Without that help from our government, Hamilton would have a hard time developing some of the lands it needs to develop in order to attract new businesses. This is a very important part of seeing things grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814497">One of the other projects that has been very close to my heart is the Marydale Park in Glanbrook. This joint federal-provincial funding of over $2 million will mean that this park will become a reality. The amazing thing about this park is that it is going to be one of the first barrier-free parks in Ontario, not just wheelchair accessible but barrier free. We can think about the opportunities this affords young people and teenagers with disabilities who are just not able to enjoy a camping experience as a result of what they have to deal with in most places. The fact that they are going to have playing fields, trails, pools and all these things, will mean so much more to these people who are unable to enjoy the camping experience. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814498">Certainly CYO in Hamilton needs to be commended because many volunteer hours have gone into this project to make this a reality. Not only will the construction jobs from these projects provide the community with short-term relief, but I believe it will also provide a wide range of full-time jobs that will become available once these projects are complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814499">Recently, with the <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State for Science and Technology</Affiliation>, I was able to announce a $2 million contribution, low interest loan, for the construction of the Canada Bread Company, as it will be looking at developing and putting in a new state-of-the-art production facility in Glanbrook. Canada Bread will be one of the first anchor tenants in the North Glanbrook Industrial Business Park and, as I just mentioned, part of that $200 million for waste water will also help provide the services that are needed so this type of investment could happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814500">This investment will be over $100 million made by the company, Canada Bread, to construct a 375,000 square foot bakery facility. This new world class plant will feature leading-edge equipment, best-in-class technologies, and is being touted as one of the largest bread plants in North America upon completion. This new plant will be supporting up to 300 new jobs and create approximately 120 construction-related jobs during the construction phase of the project. That will be helpful for those residents in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814501">New technologies that are being implemented in this facility leads well into what Her Excellency spoke to when she commented on the unprecedented investments in Canada's economic action plan that the government is building by bolstering up our science and technology strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814502">This goes again to some of the things I said earlier about how important it is to look at how we commercialize and deal with technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814503">One of those other companies that does a great job in my riding is called Accipiter Radar. Accipiter Radar has been there for a number of years and it has been working on state-of-the-art radar technology. It has attracted the attention of people in the U.S., homeland security, as well as some of the companies we have here. It does a phenomenal job and it does great work for a small company in a very small town.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814504">These are some of the things I believe are important. I was pleased to see in our budget that we committed $20 million for Pathways to Education, which has been very near and dear and close to my heart. This organization has done phenomenal work. It has taken the drop-out rate in certain areas, such as Regent Park, that was north of 56%, to below 10%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814505">We are concerned about the economy where we need people to have knowledge, and there is this dirty little secret that if we do not finish high school, there is no way we can get into post-secondary education. Pathways, through mentoring, tutoring and some short-term and long-term incentives, has given these kids hope. These kids, who were dropping out, hanging around gangs and taking their cue from the drug dealers on the street, are now being mentored in a way where they get to see people, professionals, come in and demonstrate the kinds of things that they could just maybe one day hope to accomplish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814506">I believe these are the kinds of investments that are so important because if we look at a less than 10% drop-out rate, it is better than the provincial average, which is around 25% or 26%. Now 80% of those people are going on to post-secondary education. That is a pretty exciting thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814507">This is just one way our government believes that we can change the way things are happening in this country. It is coming alongside organizations like Pathways. It started one community in Regent Park. It is now in seven communities across the country, from coast to coast, and moving on a number of additional initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814508">I am very excited about the prospects for this country. This has been too long in coming and the government has done a great job to put Canada back on the map where it belongs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814509">Mr. Speaker, my questions have to do with the vision of the throne speech, because so many elements of it seem to be somewhat shortsighted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814510">One element I speak of is regional development agencies. There is one in southern Ontario and one in my area of Atlantic Canada. For the most part the programs were initiated years ago with a five-year term. There was a long-range outlook. It seems that all these programs do not have that now. Several initiatives are year over year. It is hard for many of the development agencies, and certainly for local economic development groups, to engage in these programs not knowing if they will receive funding in the following year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814511">The other issue is the rural aspect. I wonder if my colleague could address cost sharing. A lot of smaller communities are unable to put up their share for the programs, which makes it problematic certainly in my riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814513">One example of how we have brought some permanency and stability to local governments in particular is through the gas tax transfer. From year to year local municipalities did not know what was going to happen, whether it would be permanent. We raised it and we made it permanent. That is just one example of how municipalities can count on this government for a source of funding that will be there year after year. As a result, they can plan things.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814515">The government says the economy is going to grow by 2.6% in 2010. It has to do at least that since the working age population is growing by 1% per year.

              <ParaText id="1814525">In the last three months there have been many voices raised to illustrate the serious problems people in my constituency are currently experiencing, at the same time, and very appropriately, reminding us of the battles to be fought to ensure that the government grasps the seriousness of the issues and that Quebec comes through this in better shape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814526"> There is still a lot of work to be done to improve the living conditions of many of our fellow citizens. Whoever we are—men, women, seniors, young people, immigrants, people with disabilities—we all aspire to live in a society where our values and choices are respected, and where the ideas of fairness and caring are not just empty words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814527"> The participation of the people of Vaudreuil—Soulanges has been invaluable and contributed greatly to the report that the Bloc Québécois presented, “Saisir l'occasion pour le Québec 2010”. The report is available on the Bloc Québécois Internet site. Together, we undertook a crucial effort to give them back their voice in Parliament during prorogation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814528"> It is obvious that the present government has chosen to follow the path laid down in its 2006 economic statement, at the expense of the extremely pressing needs of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814529"> With this Speech from the Throne, we have too many people falling between the cracks, while forecasters all agree that the economic recovery is weaker in Quebec than in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814530"> The throne speech of the Conservative government is far from perfect. It makes it glaringly obvious that Quebec’s needs will be ignored, once again, even though the Bloc Québécois has developed reasonable proposals that take the current economic situation into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814531"> Our priority is to help people get through the crisis. We have proposed measures to stimulate job creation and preservation, in particular in the manufacturing and forestry sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814532"> We have asked that education transfers be restored to 1994 levels, to stimulate the economy, to help Quebec and the provinces and to prepare for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814533"> If the Conservative government is truly serious when it says we have to invest in education, we need $800 million for Quebec alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814534"> When the Conservative government tells us that it will not reduce health and education transfers, it fails to mention that capping equalization payments deprives Quebec of $1 billion in revenue. It has made unilateral cuts and it is determined not to restore the transfers. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814535"> Quebec was the first province to harmonize its sales tax with the federal tax. What is the real reason why Quebec is being deprived of $2.2 billion? Why is the federal government working so hard to undermine the capacity of the Government of Quebec to help its people, by reducing the financial resources available to it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814536"> The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s statement is quite surprising and contradictory. Members can see this for themselves, by going over what was said by the Bloc Québécois and the government during question period yesterday and today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814537"> I would also add that we have proposed strategic investments, to reduce our dependence on oil, and at the same time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814538"> I was not surprised to hear what the people of Vaudreuil—Soulanges had to say at our various meetings, when they clearly identified the endemic underfunding of regional environmental protection organizations. They are suffering bitterly from the inertia of the Conservative government, which, year after year, has ignored calls for increases in their operating budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814539"> Businesses that are keen to innovate environmentally and that develop green energy expertise help to enhance productivity and contribute to the economic recovery. They also help to improve our environmental performance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814540"> Businesses with an environmental focus have significant influence. They create new jobs and support the major shift our society must make in protecting the environment, for all of us and for future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814541"> It is not surprising to see that, in the fight against climate change, the Conservatives are continuing to do what they do best, which is nothing. As they did in Copenhagen, they are refusing to eliminate the benefits given the oil companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814542"> At the very least, we can say they are increasingly moving away from the Kyoto objective, although the Canadian government had committed to reduce its emissions by 6% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814543"> There is nothing on transportation. The throne speech is silent on the major investment needed in public transit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814544"> Prorogation changed nothing. The Conservative government is steering the same course with its recovery plan, which is inadequate and unsuited to the reality of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814545"> While growth in Quebec will be slower than in Canada, the government provides no additional measure to stimulate the economy. Where the forestry sector is concerned, the throne speech confirms that forestry companies were left to their own devices, which led to closures and layoffs. Loans and loan guarantees are needed to get the industry back on its feet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814546"> The Conservative government is also continuing to attack culture by trying to make it easier to raise the ceiling on foreign ownership in telecommunications. By saying that the recession is not over, the government is making the right diagnosis, but is not offering the right remedies for Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814547">Employment insurance reform is more than necessary. The Bloc did great work and was able to gather what I consider very realistic proposals based on what our fellow citizens face when they lose their job. Every day, each of the members on this side of the House meet with people who are unemployed, and the message is clear. What they really need is money in their pockets and in the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814548"> The Bloc Québécois has proposed a significant improvement to the plan so as to provide greater access to everyone who loses their job. We believe that, with these changes, each year an additional 148,000 people will have access to EI. The elimination of the waiting period would mean that people would receive their first cheque in less than 14 days. Why not take a new approach to processing applications based on the assumption that the claimants are acting in good faith? That is the approach used in the processing of income tax returns. It is clear that the government has really no intention to make EI more accessible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814549"> The Conservative government has ignored a vital resource in my riding and throughout Quebec. The contribution of community agencies often goes unheralded. In addition to helping out many of the people of Vaudreuil-Soulanges, they too create quality jobs in the region. We cannot consider economic recovery without the community agencies, hence the need to ensure they continue to exist and carry out their mission. Community agencies are known for their considerable ability to adapt and have always been forward thinking and creative in difficult times. It only makes sense for these agencies to demand better financial support so that government objectives tied to the well-being of communities hit by the economic crisis are not compromised. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814550">The Canada Summer Jobs program allows organizations and businesses to hire students for the summer. While the program takes into account local needs and priorities, our various community organizations and businesses have an ever-increasing need to fill positions. While manpower was available, these positions that were not filled could have helped with succession planning in a number of sectors, enhancing employment skills in the Vaudreuil-Soulanges area in both the short and long term. Enhancing the Canada summer jobs program would have been an appropriate and tangible way to help young people. We have to support the creation of quality jobs, not ignore well established programs. The government could transfer the administration of the program to Quebec, with full compensation, as previously suggested by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814551">In this time of fragile recovery, choices have to be made, forcing the government to reassess some priorities based on the money available. The Bloc Québécois will continue to call on the federal government to use the annual surplus from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to supplement its investment in social housing to the tune of 1% of federal expenditures. If the Conservative government had implemented the proposals put forward by the Bloc a long time ago and invested heavily in social housing, we would probably have been better off during the housing crisis. Some families currently spend 60% of the family income on rent, while this percentage used to be much lower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814552">I have to say a few words about the measures for seniors. The Bloc Québécois proposes that guaranteed income supplement benefits be increased by at least enough to bring them up to the poverty line, this in addition to making these benefits automatic and paying retroactive benefits in full. There are also measures dealing with culture and agriculture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814553">I will conclude by saying that any enhancements to programs such as the guaranteed income supplement, social housing and employment insurance have been totally ignored by this Conservative government. Measures are needed to help these people, and we make it our priority. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814572">I have sat in the House of Commons for over five years.

              <ParaText id="1814573">When the budget was presented, we learned that the oil companies were being given tax deductions, even though they pollute and rake in billions of dollars in profits. The government is prepared to give them tax deductions to improve their productivity, at the same time as it is failing to provide any support for people who have lost their jobs, the unemployed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814574"> Even banks have been given tax deductions. We are well aware that banks in Quebec and Canada are making huge profits. Very recently, statistics showed that the CEOs and presidents of those banks were receiving salaries of $2 million, $3 million, $4 million and $5 million a year, and yet, once again, banks are being given tax deductions. These banks benefit from tax havens and hide their profits, at the expense of the redistribution of wealth among all members of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814575"> In the throne speech and the budget, we see absolutely nothing to help low-income families in terms of social housing. Nothing. There is no money for that. There is no will to help low-income families, no will to help the unemployed. At the time, the Liberals slashed the employment insurance program. In fact, that has continued, thanks to the Conservatives’ policies. They have looted it, and stolen billions of dollars. Nearly $60 billion has been taken from the unemployed, money that came from employer and employee premiums. That money has been stolen. And in addition, 50% of people who lose their jobs do not even have access to the scheme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814576"> There was nothing in the budget to support the unemployed. Increasing earnings and eliminating the two-week waiting period are just a few examples of what should have been done. We are not talking about billions of dollars. We are not talking about supporting people whose annual salary is $2 million or $3 million or $4 million or $5 million. We are not talking about supporting oil companies that are making outrageous profits. We are talking about helping the poor. There is no will on the part of this Conservative government to help people. There is no will to help seniors who for many years have also been deprived of the guaranteed income supplement and are living in poverty. We have called for an increase in the guaranteed income supplement for seniors. No, there was nothing in the throne speech to support seniors and increase the guaranteed income supplement. There was nothing about this in the budget. The Conservatives played politics and announced a seniors day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814577"> We agree with having a day set aside to recognize seniors' contribution to our society, but these seniors still need to be able to support themselves. Whether it be in big cities or in the country, many seniors are living in extreme poverty in unfit housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814578"> We want the guaranteed income supplement to be raised to support low income people. There is nothing to help elderly people in need. We are not talking here about people who earn $50,000 or $100,000 a year. They would not be entitled to this supplement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814579"> In Quebec, there is a crisis in the forestry industry. Quebeckers realize that in the federal system there is no desire to respect their needs and expectations. We saw that in the latest budget. Huge amounts are being invested in the automobile and the oil industries. I say that, partisan politics aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814580"> Many jobs have been lost in the forestry industry. The government gave a miserable $170 million to support it, but gave $2.7 billion to the automotive industry. People are disappointed. This comes not from me but from Jean-Pierre Dansereau, the director general of the Fédération des Producteurs de Bois du Québec, in his remarks on the latest federal budget. This is why the Conservatives are at 15% or 16% in the polls in Quebec. They do not plan on introducing new measures to help the forestry sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814581"> Joy is not abounding at the Conseil de l'industrie forestière du Québec either. This industry has to survive in order to benefit from the few measures of interest in the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s budget. The forestry industry in Quebec is dying and needs financial support. It needs loans and loan guarantees. The measures announced may meet some needs, but the industry would have preferred refinancing at a commercial rate in order to survive the crisis rather than support for new technologies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814582"> As regards the manufacturing sector, in 2004, I and some of my colleagues cited the closures of textile plants around Huntingdon and in my riding. We called for loan guarantees from the Liberal government, which was in office at the time. We called on it to support the manufacturing industry, which we were about to lose. But the Liberals did nothing to support it. Many plants closed their doors and people found themselves without a job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814583"> Today, the forestry industry and in the manufacturing sector are still in crisis. The Liberals and the Conservatives are tarred with the same brush. When the time comes to help people in need, to help industries in crisis, the parties in the House do not want to support them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814589">Mr. Speaker, I draw the member's attention to page 8 of the throne speech, which speaks to the implementation of a national securities regulator. The member should know we have had a number of fights over this issue over the last number of years with Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba and others, calling it a jurisdictional issue and wanting to keep the control of securities regulation under provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814590">The federal government somehow thinks that by setting up a national securities regulator, it is going to solve the problem. My argument has been that it is not the organization so much as the people who run the organization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814591">If a national securities regulator keeps doing what it has been doing in the past, which is hiring people from the industry that it is supposed to be regulating, then it is basically an inactive and ineffective organization. For example, Conrad Black committed his white collar crimes in Canada, yet it was the Americans who put him in jail. What is the point of having a national organization if it is no more effective than the provincial organizations that are in place right now?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814595">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time today with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128348" Type="2">Chatham-Kent—Essex</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814596">Oshawa is often considered the Canadian ground zero for the financial crisis that gripped the world over the last 18 months. Its economic reliance on General Motors and the many feeder plants led some naysayers to believe that a mass exodus would occur and quickly turned Oshawa into the Flint, Michigan of the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814597">This government's commitment to putting the Canadian economy first through the creation and implementation of the economic action plan has ensured that not only will Oshawa navigate through this storm, but she will emerge as a stronger, more economically diversified city.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814598">Phase one of the economic action plan recognized the economic diversity of our nation and the programs introduced were tailored to meet the specific needs for the country's different regions. This well thought out approach to the global downturn allowed communities like mine across the nation to apply and receive unprecedented federal investment in aging infrastructure, parks and community centres, new and exciting economic engines, educational and research facilities. The list goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814599">Global economists cite the Canadian example time and time again. Our financial institutions are the mark for others in the G20. Our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128403" Type="2">Whitby—Oshawa</Affiliation>, was named the finance minister of the year for drafting the blueprint, which serves as a map to economic health and future prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814600">Investment and the creation of new jobs and growth were the goals of the economic action plan and reiterated again in the Speech from the Throne. The plan is working and we must stay the course and see it through to its completion to ensure all Canadians benefit from a newly invigorated global leading economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814601">For those who would question our government's direction, I would like to cast a light on ground zero and use Oshawa as a litmus test for the economic reaction to the economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814602"> When people think of Oshawa, their minds instantly turn to General Motors. Oshawa is home to award winning assembly plants and some of the finest manufacturing professionals in the entire world. However, their excellence would be no shield to the economic storm that would bring GM to its knees and threaten to force Canadian jobs south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814603">Our government responded by being the first at the table with a plan to keep jobs in Canada. This investment was controversial to some, but tough decisions had to be made and our government did not hesitate. We are seeing that investment pay off. In Oshawa alone, additional overtime shifts and temporarily laid-off workers are being added on a consistent basis. General Motors sales are improving and it is paying back its loans faster than expected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814604">We are committed to the creation of the jobs of tomorrow, jobs that will have Canadians leading the way globally in technology and innovation. This strategy starts in the hallways of our post-secondary institutions. This initiative began last year with the creation of the knowledge infrastructure program. This program created a two year $2 billion economic stimulus measure to support infrastructure enhancement at post-secondary institutions across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814605">The program provides funding to support deferred maintenance, repair and expansion projects at universities and colleges and responds directly to the need indicated by post-secondary institutions to improve existing campus infrastructure across the entire country. A major portion of this infrastructure is near the end of its projected life cycle and in many cases does not adequately meet the needs of today's research and teaching activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814606">This program not only led to improved facilities at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology and Durham College, which both call Oshawa home, but also led to outside investment by the private sector. General Motors of Canada took advantage of increased funding at the university and entered into a partnership with the school for the founding of the Automotive Centre of Excellence, which will guarantee that the next generation of automotive innovation will be born in Oshawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814607">Another program that was immensely successful in protecting economies that were especially susceptible due to heavy reliance on a single industry was the community adjustment fund. The eligible communities were defined by specific criteria, using indicators such as job losses and unemployment rate. Only communities with a population of less than 250,000 were eligible. This targeted approach added an extra shield to those who were feared to be hardest hit. Budget 2009 provided $1 billion over two years for the fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814608">Oshawa again benefited from the fact that the government recognized that we, as well as similar communities, needed special measures to ensure growth alongside the larger urban centres. The city of Oshawa definitely benefited from successful applications to the CAF.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814609">The community adjustment fund has supported activities such as the community transition plans that foster economic development, science and technology initiatives and other measures that promote economic diversification. The fund is being delivered nationally through the regional development agencies, Industry Canada as well as the newly created Federal Economic Development Agency for southern Ontario and Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency. These two newly created agencies provide expert insight on how best to promote growth in the respective regions and will continue to be a staging point for developing future growth.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814610">The government has accelerated work to assess and remediate federally contaminated sites, with over $153 million worth of projects under way or completed. This work is helping to create jobs and economic activity in communities across Canada, while contributing to new green spaces and cleaner bodies of water and soils and enabling long-term development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814611">Through this program Oshawa is at the brink of a resolution to a 40-year-old dispute, which will see a once stagnant harbour spring back to life and balance both industrial growth as well as recreational use. The Oshawa Harbour was identified by name in last year's budget and has been allocated over $9 million to bring this hidden jewel back to its former natural brilliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814612">These are only three examples, three programs which were able not only to allow Oshawa to provide potentially crippling economic disaster, but to emerge poised to be a leader in the fields that extend beyond our traditional excellence in manufacturing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814613">With the first phase of the economic action plan now completed and the positive results of the plan being reflected in Canada's strong fiscal performance among the G20, this government will now implement the second and final phase of the economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814614">The final phase of our economic action plan outlined in budget 2010 has three main priorities: first, to implement and confirm the remaining $19 billion in stimulus measures to help create and maintain jobs; second, to invest in limited but targeted initiatives to build jobs, foster economic growth in Canada and make Canada an attractive destination for new business investments; and third, outline our plan to return Canada to surplus and bring balance to our finances over the medium and long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814615">First and foremost, the government is committed to jobs and economic growth. The government was able to effectively and efficiently get record amounts of stimulus funding out the door in 2009. Thanks to these measures, we are seeing some signs of recovery, however, the recovery remains fragile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814616">There are approximately $19 billion left of stimulus measures that will take effect in 2010. This $19 billion includes: $3.2 billion in personal income tax relief, including the enhanced working income tax benefit, WITB, to strengthen work initiatives for low income Canadians; $4 billion to protect Canadian workers, including additional EI benefits and more training opportunities to help unemployed Canadians in hard hit cities like Oshawa; $7.7 billion in infrastructure stimulus to create jobs; and $1.9 billion to create the economy of tomorrow. This investment will strengthen our capacity for research, accelerate private sector investment and enhance the ability of Canadian businesses to invest in the global markets. There are $2.2 billion to support industries and communities. This funding will provide support for hard hit sectors, such as forestry, agriculture, small business and culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814617">Commitments are in place for almost 16,000 projects across the country. With the remaining stimulus, measures going out the door, the government is taking big steps to encourage investment in the Canadian economy to foster growth and create jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814618">Just one of the measures we have taken is to make Canada a tariff-free zone for manufacturers. This government will be eliminating all remaining tariffs on productivity, improving equipment and goods imported for further manufacturing in Canada. Manufacturing cities such as Oshawa will benefit from this policy. When implemented, this will provide approximately $300 million in duty savings for Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814619">Furthermore, the government has made it a goal for Canada to emerge from the global recession with a highly competitive tax system that will attract investment and create jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814620">This year Canada will have the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G7. By 2012, Canada will have the lowest statutory corporate income tax rate in the G7. Improvements will also be made to Canada's system of international taxation to facilitate investments, cut red tape, streamline the compliance process associated with taxation of cross-border activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814621">These measures will ensure that Canada's tax system is able to compete on a global scale, create jobs and help grow the economy. Economic growth will not only be targeted in our traditional markets, but also for the green industries and jobs of tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814622"> The final phase of the economic action plan includes measures to promote energy investments and help deploy clean energy technologies. Some of the measures include establishing a next generation renewable power initiative and implementation of advanced clean energy technologies and expanding eligibility for accelerated capital cost allowance investment in clean energy.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1814635">moved that Bill <Document DbId="4328853" Type="4">C-343, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Employment Insurance Act (family leave)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="7">Bill C-343. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="1814636">She said: Mr. Speaker, I am once again very proud to introduce Bill <Document DbId="4328853" Type="4">C-343, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Employment Insurance Act (family leave)</Document>, at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814637"> This bill would amend the Canada Labour Code to allow employees to take unpaid leave from work for a period of 52 to 104 weeks for the following family-related reasons: the inability of their minor child to carry on regular activities because the child suffers a serious physical injury during the commission or as the direct result of a criminal offence; the disappearance of their minor child; the suicide of their spouse, common-law partner or child; or the death of their spouse, common-law partner or child during the commission or as the direct result of a criminal offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814638"> This bill also amends the Employment Insurance Act to allow these employees to receive benefits for up to 52 weeks while on leave instead of the 15 weeks currently provided for sickness benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814639"> In December 2007, the Quebec National Assembly showed the way by passing Bill 58, which allows employees and their families who were the victims of a criminal act or who are mourning a suicide or have a missing child to take unpaid leave and keep their jobs for a period of up to 104 weeks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814640"> Unfortunately, the current federal legislation results in discrimination against people whose jobs fall under the Canada Labour Code. Since these people do not have their jobs guaranteed, they can take only 15 weeks of sick leave. The failure of the federal legislators to act in this regard has created two categories of workers: those who can get through difficult times with their jobs intact and those who are forced to choose between losing their jobs and returning quickly to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814641"> It is one thing to allow people to take some time off and return to the same kind of job, but the result will be the same if they do not have enough income to meet their needs: they will have no other choice than to return quickly to work. It is particularly difficult for them to rebuild their lives. In the view of the Bloc Québécois, which has always been very concerned about victims and their families, the federal government should immediately follow Quebec's lead for a number of reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814642"> We know very well that suicide, violent crimes and disappearances are tragic events that are very difficult for the families of the victims. These events cause great psychological distress for many relatives and parents. The victims’ families wait and worry, mourn and frequently feel depressed, often over extended periods of time. In cases of murders and disappearances in particular, more than two years can pass between the criminal act and the resolution of the investigation. During this period, family members are deeply affected. They cannot pursue their regular activities. They have access to support and help, but they have no financial support. Additional financial worries are the last thing they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814643"> It is terrible to think that, at present, these people are left to their fate and have to keep working during this period as if nothing had happened because they have to meet their family’s needs as we all do. These people need time to get over such difficult events and gradually rejoin the work force at their own pace. Denying and ignoring that is simply adding insult to injury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814644">Sadly, several disappearances and murders have shaken Quebec in recent years. I think of Cédrika Provencher, Nancy Michaud, Alexandre Livernoche, Julie Surprenant, Julie Boisvenu, Jolène Riendeau and Natasha Cournoyer. We can also think of the 14 victims of the tragedy at the École Polytechnique, as well as the shootout at Dawson College that claimed the life of young Anastasia De Sousa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814645">In my riding of Compton—Stanstead, Isabelle Bolduc was assaulted and murdered in 1996. Last Friday, the incident in which Whitney et Tracy Hannah were shot to death in Belleville, Ontario, is another example of these terrible tragedies for the families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814646">I have given but a few examples, but it is for the relatives, friends and loved ones of all these families that I am fighting today and calling on the cooperation of all parties. After all, because of the pain and suffering and other impact of violent acts, are the victims' families not victims themselves? Grieving following a disappearance, murder or suicide takes longer than in other instances, particularly when rape or violence has taken place. There are more feelings of frustration, rage and powerlessness. This is especially true when a crime or suicide is involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814647">This reality has been recognized by several members of this House, including Conservative members. For instance, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128239" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> expressed with conviction compassion and concern for the lives of victims.

              <ParaText id="1814651">There were symbolic measures to go with these fine speeches. This government even established the annual National Victims of Crime Awareness Week in 2005 and organizes symposiums on that occasion. Such well-intentioned events look good on the calendar and provide great photo-ops, but how do they provide tangible help to the victims' families?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814652">Not only are these types of measures inadequate, but the Conservative members are talking out of both sides of their mouths.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The employment insurance program already responds to the needs of Canadians in these difficult circumstances.

              <ParaText id="1814655">What is more, this government says that provincial compensation measures such as IVAC are enough for these families. But is $3,000 really enough to cover a family's expenses for months? As a mother, I would say no. The government is lying when it says that 15 weeks of employment insurance with a bit of additional compensation can cover the needs of a family as it heals from such a tragedy. The reality is that in 2010, people who are filled with sorrow have to return to work as though nothing ever happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814656">Despite that, the <Affiliation DbId="128852" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and to the Minister of Labour</Affiliation> went on to say:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814658"> That is all very well, but a structure that costs $1.5 million a year and serves “to ensure the federal government meets its responsibilities” is really not enough. What families need is not more administrative layers, but rather money to live on. Bureaucracy is being fattened up, but the relatives of victims who want to take time off work to look after their family and deal with their pain remain just as badly off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814659"> With last week's budget, the government provided for some $6.6 million over two years to increase support for victims of crime. Not only is this sum an affront, but what it covers and how it will be allocated remain a mystery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814660"> Emailed questions to the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> are returned unanswered for reasons of security. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814661"> This dubious excuse is used so often for so many reasons by the members opposite that it is meaningless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814662"> Not only is this bill furthest along in the legislative process, but it provides a much better response to the needs of the families of victims of crime than the bill referred to by the Conservatives in the latest throne speech. The potential Conservative bill—which does not yet exist—will be much more restrictive, since it will provide special benefits only to the families of murder victims. The Bloc's bill, on the other hand, includes the families of victims of crimes causing death and of suicide victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814663"> The potential Conservative bill promises these people access only to employment insurance sickness benefits, that is, to 15 weeks of benefits. The Bloc calls for benefits that could extend to 52 weeks, when the situation requires it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814664"> On December 10, the Conservative government, the one that keeps saying how it wants to help victims, said that it would vote against Bill <Document DbId="4328853" Type="4">C-343</Document>. It added that it would introduce its own bill excluding any type of new EI benefits. If that happens, the public will rightly understand that this government prefers to fill prisons with minors rather than help those who really need it. That is a serious mistake. If the Conservative government were consistent, it would support this bill without hesitation and turn its words into commitments for affected families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814665"> Since they came to power, these Reform Conservatives have talked ad nauseam about being tough on crime. Law and order for them is nothing less than a government priority. They loudly proclaim that their goal is the well-being and security of the public, focusing their speeches on cracking down on criminals. The measures adopted prior to prorogation on prison terms are law and order measures only. The parents and partners of victims are left to their own devices and too often forgotten. This is why it is not enough to fill the prisons. Support must be given to those affected by these crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814666"> If the members of this House oppose this bill, they will no doubt say that these measures will cost the government too much, with the extension of EI benefits from 15 to 52 weeks. The members opposite are saying that the bill will cost over $400 million. As usual, they are either miscalculating or lying deliberately. Fortunately, the type of tragic event requiring 52 weeks of benefits does not happen often. There have been fewer crimes committed in recent years, which considerably reduces the number of such incidents and thus the number of people needing EI benefits for 52 weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814667">Similarly, there are not many people who would become eligible for EI after the adoption of the bill. Everyone reacts in his or her own way to the loss of someone, but for some eligible people, a loss of income is not an option. We can also see that for some people, remaining at work is a way to get back to a normal life after a while. There are also people who do not work or who cannot find an insurable job or who do not work enough hours to be eligible for benefits. For all those reasons, the $400 million projected by the government is far too high. It is certainly a far cry from the Conservative government's defence budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814668">Employees and employers are contributing enough to EI to allow families affected by such traumatic events to collect benefits. The government does not pay into EI. The $56 billion surplus that simply vanished from the EI fund makes the low cost of the bill all the more obvious. It is clear that if the government really cares for victims and their families, it will not hesitate for one second to support the bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814669">If, however, the government votes against the bill, the public will conclude with good reason that it is totally indifferent to the families of victims. People will not soon forget because they have always been very sensitive to that issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814677">Madam Speaker, this is probably an example of a fissure of opinion where it has been sort of described as something that is an intention and something that is far more specific in this particular situation. Obviously this program that the member is putting forward is a tad bit more generous than what we are seeing on the other side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814678">My first question is this. The Conservatives will say that it cost $400 million. I would like to get the member's estimate on what she believes it will cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814679">The second question is this. The member talked about 15 weeks of benefits going to 52 but the qualifying period could be different. For instance, in my riding one needs 420 hours to qualify but for sick benefits one needs 600 hours. So there is a national standard for the hours needed for sick benefits but not a national standard for regular benefits which is based on unemployment numbers in a certain region to qualify for regular EI. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814680">Is the member talking about a national standard or will she link this to the regional rate of unemployment, that and the total cost of the program?</ParaText>

So, we established a comparison between sick leave benefits and compassionate care benefits for informal caregivers under the EI program. We came up with a figure of $50 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814684">Regarding the new special benefits program the federal government is talking about, I would have liked to answer my colleague, but each time we send an email to the minister, it is returned with a message saying that it cannot be delivered for national security reasons.

There is no particular magic formula for what is the right amount of time to deal with this kind of trauma or turns of events. That is especially true when grieving families are victims of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814693"> What we need, therefore, is an approach that is flexible enough to meet the unique needs of families in these circumstances. We need an approach that is compassionate. We also need an approach that is as accessible as possible for those who need this kind of assistance. Looking after the needs of citizens who fall victim to violent crime is a priority for this government, has been a priority of this government and will continue to be a priority of this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814694">As indicated in the remarks I made in the House on December 10, 2009, our government is concerned about the impact of violence on all Canadians. We are taking action in a manner that is balanced and fair. There have been several references to this bill indicating that this legislation is based upon legislation that was recently implemented in the province of Quebec. This legislation provides a strong example of how a government can support those who are suffering from a violent criminal act. It is my understanding that the Quebec legislation was largely due to the successful efforts of the Murdered or Missing Persons' Families' Association and, in particular, its past president, Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814695">Members may recognize his name as Mr. Boisvenu was named to the Senate by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on January 29, 2010. Mr. Boisvenu was recently part of the announced legislation to strengthen the National Sex Offender Registry and the National DNA Data Bank yesterday with the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, and just days ago, he helped announce legislative amendments to strengthen the way the young offenders system deals with violent repeat young offenders. We welcome him to the Senate and wish him every success as he continues to work on behalf of victims of crime to ensure they receive the support they deserve from every level of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814696">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128168" Type="2">Compton—Stanstead</Affiliation> is to be commended for bringing this issue before the House. We can all see the intent of this bill, which is to give comfort to families who are in a situation that can only be described as heartbreaking. That intent is laudable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814697">For any family member, the loss of a loved one is painful. It is almost unimaginable when that loss involves a child. I do not think any member of the House or any citizen of this country would ever expect a grieving family to simply carry on after a few days off. There needs to be more time to heal and a comprehensive plan to support these individuals as they come to grips with the impact this violent criminal act has had on their lives. I will be frank. We need to be broader in our approach than this bill permits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814698">Members on this side of the House understand the need to support victims of crime. This is why our government has had such a strong record of helping individuals whose lives have been fundamentally changed by violent crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814699">It was our government that created the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime. This position was created to better meet the needs of victims of crime in areas of federal jurisdiction. It was with great pride that in April of 2007, the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> named Steve Sullivan as the first ombudsman. Victims can contact this office to learn more about their rights under federal law and the services available to them or to make a complaint about any federal agency or federal legislation dealing with victims of crime.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814700">In addition to its direct work with victims, the office of ombudsman also works to ensure that policy-makers and other criminal justice personnel are aware of victims' needs and concerns, and to identify important issues and trends that may negatively impact victims. Where appropriate, the ombudsman may also make recommendations to the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814701">It was our government that contributed $52 million to the victims fund to improve the experience of victims in the criminal justice system. This fund provides individual victims of crime with emergency funding to prevent undue hardship when there is no other source of financial assistance. It also provides funds for family members of homicide victims to assist them with the expenses incurred to attend early parole eligibility hearings or National Parole Board hearings. This is in addition to the support for NGOs that encourage the development of new approaches, promote access to justice for victims of crime, improve the capacity of victim service providers, foster the establishment of referral networks and increase awareness of services available to victims of crime and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814702">It is important to remember in the context of this debate the significant role provinces play, both in administrating the criminal justice system as well as providing supporting for victims of crime. This bill can only apply to federally regulated industries, which comprise around 10% of the Canadian workforce. That is why the provincial and territorial implementation component of the victims fund is designed to encourage implementation of federal, provincial and territorial legislation for victims of crime. This would include Criminal Code provisions, such as victim impact statements and testimonial aids as well as support for adherence to the Canadian statement of basic principles of justice for victims of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814703">However, our work is not done and we have committed to doing more. That is why the following piece was included in the Speech from the Throne:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814704">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Our Government will also offer tangible support to innocent victims of crime and their families. It will give families of murder victims access to special benefits under Employment Insurance. It will introduce legislation to give employees of federally regulated industries the right to unpaid leave if they or members of their families are victimized by crime. And our Government will introduce legislation to make the victim surcharge mandatory, to better fund victim services.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814705">This is not a new commitment by our government. During the first hour of debate in the second session of this Parliament on December 10, 2009, I signaled the intent of the government to bring forward its own legislation to assist victims of crime and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814706">While there may be similarities between the broad direction the government has indicated and the member's bill, I do not wish to unduly get the member's hopes up. When I spoke to the bill in the second session of this Parliament, I indicated that the government cannot support the bill. That position has not changed. While we share a common purpose, there are significant details in this bill that will inadvertently increase the cost of such a program or have unintended consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814707">There is also a need for a more comprehensive approach to this issue. While having time off to grieve is essential, our government has taken a more participatory approach to the criminal justice system. We have worked across multiple departments to address the needs of those affected by crime. Without revealing any details of the coming government announcement, I can only say that the government's approach will be more encompassing when addressing the needs of family members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814708">The member across may question why we would not simply be able to amend her bill at committee. The problem is that the government's proposed changes would go beyond the scope of her bill, and once that scope is established at second reading, it would be procedurally impossible to amend it at committee stage. That is why it would make good sense simply to have this bill traded down the order paper or be defeated at second reading and to support the government's legislation when it is introduced in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814709">For these reasons, we cannot support the bill. I would urge all members of the House to put off consideration of the bill until the government has a chance to table the measures that were mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814710">Canadians take great pride in being a society that cares for the most vulnerable and lends a helping hand to those who need it when faced with adversity. In that regard, there is much potential in the bill, but I would urge all members of the House to wait for the government's proposal to be introduced in its place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814711">Our government has deep sympathy for family members of victims of violent crime, and our legislation and legislative record demonstrate this. Not only are we providing victims of violent crime with the tools they need, we are also finding solutions to help protect our citizens from becoming victims of crime in the first place.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128321" Type="2">Mr. Robert Oliphant (Don Valley West, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1814712">Madam Speaker, I commend the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128168" Type="2">Compton—Stanstead</Affiliation> for presenting the bill. I thank her for her hard work and for her bringing this discussion to the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814713">I think it is unfair, as the parliamentary secretary has suggested, that we wait for a government bill, which we have not seen. We have intent from the government, but I want to commend the member for going beyond intent and actually bringing something, a hard piece of work for us to discuss and to consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814714"> I am still working out my own personal thought about the member's bill, but I sense it is important legislation that would benefit discussion at committee. Therefore, I expect I will support it going to committee for a thoughtful response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814715">The members from the opposition side of the House have suggested there are some amendments that we might like to see. I understand the hon. member has indicated that she and her party would be open to listening to some of those thoughtful exchanges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814716">I come to this bill less as a member of Parliament, but more from my experience as a United Church minister. I have worked with families that have gone through great loss and some of those losses have been as a result of crime. I have worked with victims of crime and members of families of victims of crime. I very much appreciate the intent of the bill and its understanding that in those times of great loss, in those times of grief, in those times of wonder, it is important we recognize that an injury to one is indeed an injury to all and that we, as a society, have to help the individual, which do through our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814717">I am very much of the understanding that when I pay my taxes, it is my opportunity to share. When I pay my EI premiums, it is my opportunity to share in a collective opportunity, where we together recognize that each one of us could be a victim, and by the grace of God most of us are not. Therefore, we pool our resources together to help those who have been victims of crime or who are less fortunate in a variety of ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814718">There is a long history in the way we have understood victims and offenders in crime. Originally, in most of common law, we understood that there were two parties in the crime, the victim and the offender. Over time, we changed our opinion to understand that the crime was not so much a crime against just the victim, it was a crime against Her Majesty, against the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814719">Over recent years, we have seen a shift in that understanding to recognize there are many partners in that moment. There is an offender, the state and a victim. There has been a growing movement of victims' rights and an understanding that victims need care. They need to be supported, they need understanding and they also need financial resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814720"> It is very important to understand that at various times, various parts of the law need to change to adapt to a new understanding of what it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814721">The government is proud to say that it stands with victims of crime. It has put some rhetoric in its throne speech. We will await that law. However, at the same time, this legislation is worthy of our support to take it to the next stage, to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814722">There is also something else besides simply that. The bill recognizes some of the changing demographics going on in the workplace and in society. It understands that when a child, for instance, has been the victim of a crime, the caregiver is probably not a homemaker at home. In 70% of Canadian families, the caregiver is a parent, mother and/or father, who is actively engaged in the workforce. Therefore, there needs to be protection, both under the labour laws and also under employment insurance provisions, to ensure the person can maintain his or her part of the livelihood that is necessary to support the family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814723"> The hon. member has brought forth thoughtful legislation that recognizes the changing demographics of our labour force. We are behind the times in that. We still, especially on the other side of the House, tend to think of women being at home and men in the workforce. Therefore, when there is a family tragedy, that woman will still be able to help. That is not the case in most families. If it is a woman's choice, that is fine. However, most families need two incomes to maintain the family's standards of living.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814724">The changes addressed both in labour law and in EI reflect our need to be part of that. We need to open our eyes to the fact that those demographics have changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814725">This piece of legislation indicates that our EI system is not working. There is something disjointed. Opportunities that exist in one part of our country do not exist in other parts of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814726">It is interesting, maybe a little ironic, that the member from the Bloc Québécois is offering a Quebec solution to a national problem. I thank her for doing that, for offering the Quebec model in labour law to the rest of us in Canada who could benefit by putting that in national standards. For a long time the Liberal Party has argued that national standards are absolutely essential, that we maintain those across ten provinces and three territories and we celebrate them. I thank the hon. member for recognizing that for the rest of Canada, the federal legislation with respect to labour is falling short of the Quebec standard. We are being asked to raise the standards, especially with respect to federally regulated bodies, industries and agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814727">I want this bill to go to committee. We will be able to understand that EI is income replacement that needs to be understood as an insurance system. We pay premiums into that system. At various times in our lives, we need to take money out of the system. It is an employment insurance system, but it is not fairly understood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814728">I hope that as we open up the discussion on employment insurance, we might understand also that workers in Ontario are generally disadvantaged in this system. If we open up the discussion on EI, we can go a bit broader on this. We might start to look at the number of hours for EI qualification in Ontario, which is significantly higher than in other parts of the country. That means welfare demands, for example in British Columbia, Ontario or Quebec, are rising because people's EI benefits are running out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814729">This indicates that the government is failing to open up a grander discussion about EI, to recognize that employment insurance is not only used to help people in grand economic cycles, but also to help individuals and families who are struggling with real problems such as putting food on the table and putting a roof over their heads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814730">Getting back to this piece of legislation, it is important to recognize that there are still some difficulties in some of the definitions of family leave that would be offered. There has been some discussion about whether or not a parent is as important as a child as a victim of crime. Those who find themselves in the sandwich generation may have to take care of children and also elderly parents, and may be required to leave their place of work. They would want a guarantee that they would get their job back, but also would have income replacement during that time of grief or of loss. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814731">I hope that the hon. member is open to consideration of the definitions and that they may need to be expanded and fine-tuned. We would welcome that kind of discussion with her at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814732">As we go through this, we end where I began, and that is to recognize that the Liberal Party is a party that stands with victims of crime. We are concerned about the incidence of crime. We recognize that the best way to address that is to prevent crime in the first place. We do not want to sweep up after a crime, which sometimes we need to do because the government has failed to prevent crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814733">We need constantly to look at the continuum of this problem and recognize that we need to increase spending on the prevention of those things which could lead to an economic crisis for a family later. Our aim is to ensure that the government actually spends its full budget on the prevention of crime so that we can help people and stand with them in solidarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814734"> I look forward to a further debate on this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814735">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="4328853" Type="4">C-343</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814736">It was only December 10 that we were all assembled here. Primarily the same players who are making speeches tonight were making speeches that night. After that whole process, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued the House, and here we are back again to repeat where we left off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814737">I have to commiserate with the member when the parliamentary secretary says to be patient, that the government is going to deal with the issue, is going to bring in a bill that she will like, so maybe she should drop her bill and give the government leeway to bring in its own bill. The same result may happen again. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> may prorogue the House or we may get into an election and the government will escape once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814738">I am mindful of the social programs in Canada being somewhat behind those in other countries. For example, the national health care system in England, I believe, was brought in in 1949 right after the war when the economy was in bad shape. England had the foresight to bring in a national health care program. In Canada it was 1966.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814739"> France has a terrific health care program, social program. For those members who have not seen Michael Moore's movie <I>Sicko</I>, I think it is worth seeing. He profiles France's system, where people who have cancer are treated. This particular gentleman, after his recovery, was sent to the Riviera for three months to recover. In France, pregnant women have people who come in and do the laundry and cook meals. Members can see it is a totally different thought process, a different approach than we have in North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814740">In France, the Scandinavian countries and England, the approach is more to try to stay healthy, and people get through their lives and are more productive if they are healthy in body and mind. The North American approach seems to be the opposite. It is basically the rat race, the little hamster on the wheel. We race our way to the end of our lives, perform our work and have as little government as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814741">Canada has the right wing, the neo-Reaganites I guess we would call them, trying to roll back the clock. I can just imagine if these people had a majority government. The country has been saved now twice from a Conservative majority, and I really am very happy about that. Hopefully we can save the country in the future from a Conservative majority. The Conservative agenda is to roll things back. We see it right now with the race to the bottom in corporate tax rates. There is no enemy out there, but I guess the Conservatives see one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814742">The United States has a corporate tax rate of 35%. What did the Conservative government do? It took the rate down to 15%. That is supposed to create jobs, but it has no proof that that is being done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814743">Just look at the parliamentary secretary's arguments. I read <I>Hansard</I> and I was here when he spoke back on December 10. He was talking about how this bill is going to cost $400 million and saying, whoa, that is scary and we cannot do this. First of all, how does he quantify that? </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814744"> With all the crime bills the Conservative government is bringing in, the parliamentary secretary has said the crime rate will go down. If that is the case, then all the great crime bills it is going to bring in will reduce the crime rates in the country, so the cost for the bill should be even less. But no. He obviously has a different view of where the crime rates are going because while the proponent of the bill suggests that the cost will be around $50 million, he says it is $400 million. He has it eight times as high. What does he think, that the crime rate is going to go up eight times, that we have to incur costs because of this bill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814745">I would recommend to the government, and I would certainly recommend to the House, that we proceed with this bill to second reading, that we make any amendments that we need, that we proceed and pass this bill, and get it as far along the way as possible while the government is considering its options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814746">I must say to the government, while it is considering its options, it should look at England, France, and countries that have really developed social programs, when it is developing its program, it should try to come up with and bring in ideas that work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814747">We already know that corporate tax cuts do not necessarily produce results that the government thought it would. We know that mandatory minimums, that were tried 25 years ago by Ronald Reagan, have resulted in huge expansive private prisons in the United States, filled to the capacity with inmates. The crime rates have gone up. There are so many prisoners that the governor of California, who we just saw a couple of weeks ago at the governors conference, is letting people out. The state cannot afford to keep them anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814748">Can you not learn from the mistakes of others? Do you not know that if you develop the prison system the way California has and fill it up with people, you are going to bankrupt the country and you will not be able to keep the people in prison anyway, at the end of the day?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814751">We look forward to seeing what it has to say. But by no means should we ever defer to the government and somehow take this bill out of circulation just because it feels that it should be taken out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814752">I want to say that victims' rights is a fairly recent development. I know the women's movement has had a lot to do with victims' right.

              <ParaText id="1814753">Back in the 1980s when there was a break-in and people tried to find out what the resolution was, they were abruptly told by the police, “No, that is all between us and the justice system. I guess you will have to find out about by reading it in the newspaper.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814754">I am very pleased to recognize that, in Manitoba anyway, through the 11 years of the Conservative Filman government and the 10 years of the Gary Doer government that there has been considerable progress made in the area of victims' rights. That is something I think we can all agree with, that victims are the most important people in the process here. They should be handled correctly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814755">This member has done a terrific job on this bill. She deserves full credit for this bill. We should do our utmost to congratulate her and help her out. I know my colleague who spoke on this bill last time did have some questions; it was more a matter of clarification. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> was hoping for some question and answer time at the end to get answers to some questions she had, merely for clarification purposes.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="1814756">Madam Speaker, my Bloc Québécois colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128168" Type="2">Compton—Stanstead</Affiliation>, who has been fighting to have this bill passed for three years now, introduced Bill <Document DbId="4328853" Type="4">C-343</Document>, which would provide assistance for the families of victims of crime or suicide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814757">As a mother, I am very honoured to speak to this bill. I must mention that this bill has the support of a number of individuals and groups, including the Murdered or Missing Persons' Families' Association, whose current president told me that he supported the bill and wanted to see the Conservatives support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814758">I think that when we are talking about human life and suffering, partisanship no longer matters. This bill is based on the recognition of a fundamental human reality, since up until now, families of victims of crime or suicide had to continue to work through their suffering, as though nothing had happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814759">In a modern society like ours, workers who are confronted by tragedies like this must be able to have their jobs guaranteed. The federal government must follow Quebec's lead. Two years ago, with the passage of Bill 58, Quebec helped guarantee the jobs of these family members for up to two years. With Bill <Document DbId="4328853" Type="4">C-343</Document>, workers under federal jurisdiction will be protected, as are workers in Quebec. It is a matter of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814760">The bill does even more than that. As I said, the bill helps guarantee jobs, but it also allows these families to take a leave from work and to receive employment insurance benefits for up to 52 weeks. That would enable these people to deal with their suffering and work through their grief, although that can take a very long time. At least something would be done for them. Accordingly, the bill also proposes changes to the Employment Insurance Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814761">On the face of it, this bill is not only important, but absolutely crucial for the families of victims of crime. How could anyone vote against it? I simply do not understand. Who could vote against this kind of bill, which proposes important measures for these families? Who? The so-called champions of law and order, who claim they want to work for victims and help victims? As usual, it is nothing but words, words, words. When the time comes to take real action and support a bill that, logically, should be supported, they do not want to. They do not show up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814762">Personally, and many Bloc members think the same thing, I would have thought that this bill would get the support of at least one Conservative—not two, one—at least the person who has publicly supported it from its inception and even helped create it. That would be only too logical. But yesterday we learned that the senator, the one Conservative who could have supported this bill, had gone back on his word. Suddenly, the bill was no good and, according to him, it was completely useless. He added that the Conservative solution, mentioned in the throne speech and the budget, is much better and that the Conservatives no longer needed to support this bill, which is completely useless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814763">But that is not true. What the Conservatives are proposing and what this bill proposes are two completely different things. What they are proposing—or what we think they might propose—is an ombudsman, as my colleague mentioned earlier. So far, he has said the ombudsman position has been created, but upon reading, we learn that it will be created. It has not even been created yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814764">I do not know what he is talking about. I am not sure he even knows what he is talking about. There is no ombudsman, and if there is one, I would like to know. We would all like to know.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1814765">What are we being offered? $3.3 million. An ombudsman would cost $1.5 million. This would leave $1.8 million for the families of murdered children or other family members. There is nothing, however, for the families of family members who have been kidnapped. Naturally, there is nothing with respect to suicide. There is nothing for children who might have suffered severe injuries. Nothing. Can it be said that our bill and these proposals are one and the same? No. Logic dictates that they are not the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814766">Our bill is much more generous. Incidentally, I thank the other two opposition parties for recognizing it outright.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814767">Our bill was drafted with this person. To say that it is completely useless is tantamount to saying that the bill is useless to those having to cope with the disappearance of minor children, the death by suicide of a spouse, common law partner or child, and the families with minor children who have become disabled as a result of a crime, that it is useless and irrelevant to them. To say that this bill is completely useless shows contempt for all the families of victims of crime other than murder. I am sorry to say that I would never have expected such a degree of partisanship in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814768">Let us be clear. The Conservatives' proposal set out in the throne speech and the budget is a clunker, as they are called in the automotive industry. The reality is that we do not want their clunker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814769">As I said, we have the support of the new president of the AFPAD, the murdered or missing persons' families' association.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814773">Madam Speaker, I would like to set the record straight. It seems that I dared to question the minister about certain things and I got a rather disagreeable response today to effect that his party was the only one that was proud of the performance of our athletes at the Olympic Games. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814774">That is absolutely not true. Hon. members will recall that when Parliament resumed on March 4, the hon. members of the House from all parties celebrated and gave our athletes a standing ovation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814775">Hon. members will also recall that it was the same thing when Barbara Ann Scott came to the House with the Olympic flame. Everyone, without exception, was happy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814776">Today I heard the minister say that his party was the only one that was proud of the Games. Let us be clear: we were all happy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814777">My question on March 4 was on the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games. I dared to quote the minister himself, who said the next day in all the newspapers across the country that there should have been more French. Those were his words, not mine. I was quoting him. He was not the only one to say so either. The Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, made some comments as well. I watched the opening ceremonies and I can say that, as a francophone, at one point I did not really identify with the ceremonies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814778">That is what my question was about. Today, again, the minister quoted the Commissioner of Official Languages with regard to the Olympic Games. Let us not forget what the Commissioner of Official Languages said about the opening ceremonies, “What I saw at the opening ceremonies was a concert which had been conceived, developed, and presented in English, with a French song. It wasn't what I expected”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814779">That is not at all what the minister told us today. I wanted to start by setting the record straight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814780">I wanted to know why the minister had given in to the Conservative habit of going into hiding and hiding documents instead of sharing information with Canadians. In this case it is somewhat understandable, because the specifications that I was looking for and that journalists were looking for were only available in English. We can understand why the government and the minister were embarrassed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814781">We had to ask the Standing Committee on Official Languages for the document. I would like to thank all the members of the committee for unanimously agreeing to this request. However, we had to wait an extra week for the document so that it could be translated. I can understand why he hesitated to make it public, but let's move on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814782">The specifications for the ceremonies, which we now have, say only one thing, and I will quote it. I think it is important that people know this. I am referring to point k in annex E of the document, a contribution agreement that committed Canadians to chip in $20 million for the ceremonies. That is a significant amount. This is what it says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1814785">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. We too would like to set the record straight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814786">Canada's Olympic Games were magnificent. Even our minster found there was not enough French during the opening ceremonies. Everyone agrees. Nevertheless, Canadians have every reason to be proud of the organization and presentation of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Canadians and Quebeckers will be left with lasting memories of the Games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814787">One of those memories will undoubtedly be the performances of our athletes from all over the country, francophone and anglophone alike, representing Canada, a country that is proud of its linguistic duality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814788">In that regard, throughout the games, both official languages were reflected in an exemplary fashion. The Canadian government and the organizers took every possible measure to make room for both of the official languages of the International Olympic Committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814789">In terms of our accomplishments, I would point out that all signage, including directional signs, were in both official languages. Oral announcements were made in both official languages, first in French in accordance with the protocol. Documents and information on the Web for the public, media, athletes and dignitaries were also provided in both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814790">The biographies of athletes and the daily updates were also written in both French and English. Bilingual volunteers were available and could be identified by the “Bonjour” pin they were wearing. Almost one million people visited Place de la Francophonie, which won a gold medal for the best place to celebrate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1814791">The Government of Canada appreciates the positive comments of the Grand Témoin de la Francophonie and the Commissioner of Official Languages concerning the use of French at the games. The Grand Témoin de la Francophonie had this to say: </ParaText>
