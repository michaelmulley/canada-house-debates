There is unquestioning consensus among members of the scientific community that animals can feel pain and they do suffer as a result of abuse or inhumane conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144184">Over one billion people around the world rely on animals for their livelihood and, as such, signatories to this petition find it incumbent upon the Government of Canada to act to better protect animals. Moreover, animals are often significantly affected by natural disasters and yet are seldom considered during relief efforts and emergency planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144185">It is for those reasons that I submit this petition urging the government to support a universal declaration on animal welfare.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144202">On the weekend, I attended the 2010 National Conference for Young Women Living with Breast Cancer. The guest speaker at that event was Yvonne Jones, the leader of the Liberal Party in Newfoundland and Labrador and the leader of the official opposition. Yvonne, who is just 42 years old, has just been diagnosed with breast cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144203">Breast cancer diagnosed in women in their forties accounted for an estimated 16.5%. or one in six of all breast cancer deaths. There are approximately three million Canadian women in the 40 to 49 age category. Mammographs, mammography and screening for that group for 10 years would save 2,100 lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144204">However, significant differences exist across jurisdictions. They include policies regarding the screening of women 40 to 49 in high risk women. Breast cancer screening programs offered by Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador do not accept women age 40 to 49, while in British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Alberta with a referral, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island do. Nunavut does not have an organized screening program at the moment</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144205">The women who signed this petition at the conference, and there will be other petitions coming, are asking the federal government to establish funding and programs so that all provinces and territories have an organized screening program, that women aged 40 to 49 be eligible for free-of-charge breast screening to begin at age 40, and that all women be able to self refer to each province's screening program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144206">The problem right now is that women cannot do that until they are 50 years old. Therefore, we are calling upon the federal government to work with the provinces and territories to improve screening practices to reduce breast cancer mortality in our country.</ParaText>

The litany where this has not been the case is a tragic one: Inco, Alcan, Falconbridge, Stelco, Nortel. These Conservative fire sales have not benefited community. Instead they have left workers out in the cold, having been thrown off the job despite promises made by both the government and the companies involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144221">Think of the communities of Sudbury, Timmins, Hamilton, Miramichi, Kenora, Thunder Bay and Vancouver Island, whether it is mining or whether it is the wood sector. In many others, workers have been left without an income for their families. That has been the consequence of the government's unwillingness to stand up to these multinational corporations, which come in here and want our resources, want to make a play in the global market and want to put our jobs offshore. They have any kind of nefarious plan up their sleeves, and the government has gone for it hook, line and sinker. That is until the people of Saskatchewan rose up and joined in a chorus to say no, and we are thankful that they did so because the government has left local economies deflated, people without their jobs, pensions attacked and collective agreements shredded by these companies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144223">When it comes to selling major Canadian companies, we believe that Canadians need to know how the sale will benefit them. But that will not happen as long as the Investment Canada Act is not amended.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144224">Right now, decisions are made behind closed doors. Government does not have to tell us. We are just supposed to take its word for it when it approves these takeovers, and frankly, Canadians are left in the dark when it comes to the future of their natural resources, their jobs and key industries in our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144225">Ottawa does not have a good track record on this, when it comes to the question of trust. In the last 25 years, between the two governing parties, they managed to reject only one bid while they rubber-stamped 13,500 takeovers and investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144226">The conditions that the government claims it is putting in place clearly are not enough. They are just as quickly ignored as they are put down on paper.

              <ParaText id="2144231">However, I will tell members one thing. When the pink slips went out and people saw that signature and had to go home to their families and tell them they had lost their jobs after they had been offered hope by the government, which said it was approving this foreign investment so that we would have a better economy, that was a tragic day and each of those families has suffered as a result.

              <ParaText id="2144234">That is why, as a result of all this, the people of Saskatchewan said no.

Let us make sure that the list with the specifics is public and available to Canadians, because if the government is not going to police these companies, Canadians will be able to police these companies and make sure the benefits are there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144242">It is good discipline, and there are some very good managers in some of these companies here in Canada. They are trying to do the right thing, but often their head office somewhere far away, motivated by shareholders who want to squeeze every dollar out of the global operation, end up saying to the Canadian manager, “Sorry, we are shutting you down”. If he or she is able to point to the agreement with the people of Canada, which is public and the Canadians are watching, this can have an impact.

The Conservatives sat back and glibly snickered at any concerns that were raised about the hostile takeovers by Xstrata and Vale. We have seen thousands of job losses. We have seen the copper refining capacity of Ontario shut down. Ore is being shipped out of the region.</ParaText>

I think having public hearings is pretty healthy. I've always been a bit concerned that the commitments that the foreign companies make to Investment Canada are confidential and the public doesn't know what they are. On an important public policy issue, I think confidentiality is not healthy.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="2144268">It is important to recognize that the act was recently undemocratically reformed through a budget bill. The Conservative government commissioned the Wilson report, which came up with a series of recommendations. The government included them as part of a budget bill. Because the Liberals felt squeezed at the time, they voted with the Conservatives. The result was that the Investment Canada Act was changed without any review whatsoever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144269">The motion put forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128276" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation> calls for a process that had been skipped over, which is amazing when we think about it. With world consolidation of natural resources, minerals and other types of businesses, we actually turned away the opportunity to update and modernize our law in a democratic way. A debate in the House of Commons, such as the one we are having today, should have been held before the Investment Canada Act was changed because the changes made to the act actually opened the door even further.</ParaText>

The government did not change the law democratically. It decided to ram it through. That is an American style of politics the Conservative government has used on several occasions, and it is really hurting this country. The government has done that with a number of budget bills. We never saw that practice before. We have been raising the alarm constantly about this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144281">This file continued throughout the summer and into the fall. It is interesting because back on August 20 the NDP leader was already calling on the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to take action on this file and to show leadership. We never saw that. At the end of the day yesterday, sadly, the minister told the Canadian public that his officials have no opinion. When there are 11 people in a department reviewing these files, one would expect they would come back with an opinion, yes or no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144282">Obviously, there are some political tactics behind that. We know the government refuses to take advice from bureaucrats on a regular basis. One example would be Statistics Canada. We lost the chief statistician because the government tried to manipulate his words. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144283">The government comes back with no recommendations from the department and then claims it is not in the best interests of Canadians but it cannot provide any further information. It has left the door open for another 30 days for the Potash Corporation deal to go forward. It is true it is the letter of the law that 30 days are available, but there seems to be a bit of glee in the minister's appeal to come back with different conditions. I am not convinced that this file is finished by any means. </ParaText>

We will continue to raise these issues because it is more than just this one case. This is about the sell-off of Canadian industry and the lack of an industrial policy for Canada. Brazil, China and other countries are looking to acquire natural resources in different types of sectors to facilitate their modern economies. Canada's plan is to sell out, to get rid of some of the most important features that we have been strong on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144288">I want to finish with a bit of discussion related to the types of jobs that we are losing. These are value-added jobs, jobs on which we can build a modern economy. It is important to recognize that because we have seen a shift to part-time employment and jobs that do not have pensions. We are losing out on the opportunity for those workers to raise their families with dignity and integrity so their children can do better than they did. We have lost that vision. We have become apathetic to that. Many students are coming out of university with huge debt loads in an economy that does not have the type of market to help them pay off that debt. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144293">I am wondering if he could address the impact this motion would have on state-owned enterprises, as well as companies listed on the TSX. Obviously the concern is that if a foreign takeover occurs and the company is taken off the TSX, then it obviously affects jobs in that area, especially the financial services sector. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144295">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and I have worked together for a number of years on the industry committee and this file has come up, off and on, at different times. With the issue over China Minmetals and the state of China, for example, we have to come to grips with the reality that they believe there is some free market society out there that floats around on its own. But it is not real when we have the fact that state-owned companies, backed by governments, can actually bring in capital and can undercut our own private sector businesses that are competing. We have to look at these in terms of national significance and strategies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144296">What is interesting is that during this timeframe of the Investment Canada Act and the sellout, we also sold shares of Petro-Canada, actually taking a bath on them because six months later they were worth a lot more than when we sold them. We could not own even part of Petro-Canada. We had to sell that off, versus it being okay for the Chinese people to be able to own the natural resources of Canada. It is wrong. We need to start looking at some of those resources strategically. Potash is one of those. Potash is critical for food supply and food management. That is why it needs to be controlled by Canadians. That is why we should keep it. It is the last bastion and we should make sure we do not lose it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144302">Mr. Speaker, there is a big difference between foreign investment and a hostile takeover, and that is what this was with Potash Corporation. It was a hostile takeover. The government does not understand that. When we look at, for example, Fiat investing in Chrysler, I supported that because it was not a hostile takeover. It was something that was done with investment strategies. It was done through the lens of the community, with educating the community and being more open and accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144303">Conservatives do not understand the difference between a hostile takeover and investment. That is what we are talking about here. We should be measuring these deals in terms of the types of jobs they are creating and then look at them through the lens of improving the community. There is nothing wrong with doing those audits. Let us audit these deals, and we cannot do that unless we have more information. Hiding behind the curtain of secrecy does not cut it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144304">When we look at the issues and at some of the natural resources, there are no significant trade secrets in these deals that need to hide everything. No, we can have a more open and more accountable process and measure them. When we measure them, we are measuring the government, measuring the investor, and making sure that it is different, because a hostile takeover is way different from investment. That is the difference with New Democrats, because we believe in the investment. The Conservatives believe hostile takeovers are okay. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144307">Before I begin, let me take a moment to recognize my Conservative colleagues from Saskatchewan. I want to say how responsibly my colleagues have acted throughout this process. I know they probably received more than their fair share of emails, telephone calls and constituency office visits. However, they recognized, as I recognize, that the government and I as their representative have a responsibility before the law to make a public policy decision with respect to the BHP Billiton bid that is in the best interests of the country, that is within the four corners of the Investment Canada Act, a decision that can be defended as one of principle, and as I said, one in the best interests of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144308">The members understood that and they acted on that basis. I want to thank them, as I am sure it weighed on their minds as much as it weighed on my mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144309">I cannot say much more, other than what I said yesterday, with respect to the BHP bid. Under the law, under the Investment Canada Act, I made an interim decision, as it is called under the legislation, that the bid was not likely to be of net benefit to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144310">This has excited a little bit of comment in the media and amongst the opposition benches, because there is a 30-day period under the Investment Canada Act for the bidder to make further representations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144311">I want to make it clear, because I believe the hon. leader of the official opposition in particular, the Liberal leader, was playing fast and loose with the facts yesterday. Maybe he is more familiar with American law on this matter or British law, but he certainly is not familiar with Canadian law. He tried to insinuate before the cameras that I had some preference or some discretion when it came to the 30-day period, that this was some sort of Conservative conspiracy and that I was not being clear with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144312">I want to be clear with Canadians. I have to act within the law. The law is very clear. The Investment Canada Act is very clear that I am only able to make an interim decision at this point. The final decision comes 30 days from last night's announcement. That is very clear in the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144313">I am very disappointed that the leader of the official opposition, the Liberal leader, was not clear with Canadians. Maybe he did not understand how the law works. That is possible, too. Or maybe he did not want to understand how the law works. If that was the case, then the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, who has more experience, being in Canada far longer than the leader of the official opposition, should have educated his leader on how the law works. Maybe he will do that in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144314">I also took note of what the NDP leader said last night. To my mind, again, he does not want to take our answer on its face as being one of principle, one that is within the four corners of the law under the Investment Canada Act. He is alleging all sorts of conspiracies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144315">I can assure this House once again that I made my decision based on the facts that were presented to me, based on what I have the duty to do, which is to assess the bid pursuant to the test of net benefit to Canada and to thereby protect the rights and interests of Canada and Canadians. That is what I did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144316">I can assure hon. colleagues that I am very much looking forward to speaking with greater clarity on the merits of the decision at the end of the 30-day period. That is the period during which I am obliged not to describe in greater detail the reasons for the decision, but I will have an opportunity to do so in a month or so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144317">I want to use the balance of my time, if I might, to speak about the context. The context is the importance of foreign investment in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144318">Unlike the members of the NDP in this House, we do believe that foreign investment has a place in our country. We welcome domestic investment. We welcome foreign investment, and in fact, that is a quid pro quo for some of the great investments that Canadian companies have made in other countries, whether it be in the United States or overseas, including countries such as Australia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144319">The fact of the matter is that our great Canadian companies make more investments overseas than countries make investments into Canada, and this has been a point of concern among some of the commentators in the past. We are a net exporter of capital by a significant margin, and we certainly welcome it when Canadian companies can not only grow jobs here but they can grow their balance sheet by making judicious investments abroad. By the same token, we also welcome investment to our shores.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144320">I would only say this, though. The investments to our shores, if they are reviewable under the Investment Canada Act, because they have to meet certain criteria in order to be reviewable, have to follow the act. There are certain obligations they have. There are certain obligations that the minister of industry has. Those are the rules of the game. I do not think it is too much to ask, when we open our doors to foreign investors, that they follow our rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144321">We are a country that is ruled by the rule of law. We are proud of that. We actually export that as a value and principle of our democracy. We believe in the rule of law, but that means that companies must follow our rules too. We do not open the door wide and say, “You can come in and you are not responsible pursuant to our laws and you do not have to be respectful of us”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144322">We do not say that. We do not mean that. We want them to be responsible and respectful of our laws. That includes the Investment Canada Act and that includes the test of net benefit to Canada under that act, which presumes, if I can be so presumptuous, that in some cases the Investment Canada Act would mean that something is of net benefit to Canada, and there may be occasional cases where that is not the case. Such was the case of BHP Billiton's bid, as I enunciated yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144323">However, generally there are some good cases. StatsCan reported earlier last year that, in terms of our investments abroad, Canadians owned and controlled foreign assets worth more than half a trillion dollars. That is the importance of two-way trade, so I would say to my hon. colleague that this is a good deal for Canada and a good deal for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144324">When Canadians invest overseas, they follow the rules of those countries, including Australia, which I might add has something similar to a net benefit to Canada test. It has a national interest test. I would put it to the House that it is more or less the same thing. We play by the rules of the game when Canadian companies invest in Australia; it would only stand to reason that it would do the same here. That is how we create wealth and opportunity for Canada and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144325">I know the hon. members on the NDP benches like to tax companies to death and they like to regulate them to death, and then when they are dead, they like to subsidize them to death. That is the NDP way, but that is not good enough in a 21st century economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144326">In conclusion, we are taking our responsibilities under the Investment Canada Act seriously. There is a good opportunity to debate the principles and the clauses of that act and I look forward to further debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144328">That was not the language he used yesterday, and certainly when the rejection of MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates came, the minister was very clear right away where he stood on that and virtually closed the door. Yes, there is a decision and then there is a 30-day appeal. It appears that he is trying to beg BHP to get back in the game here. That is what seems to be happening. There seems to be a double standard taking place, because with MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates, it was very clear, and it was very clear yesterday. There was not the language of “interim decision” used. He was very clear in saying, “This is my decision. I have reached my decision”.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2144340">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand and join my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, in discussing, not so much the BHP bid and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, but the motion put forward by the NDP. The motion recommends that we change the way the Investment Canada Act would arbitrate these types of situations. It would also take away a lot of the end result decision making from the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>. We are working under a legal precedent. However, if I remember correctly, this document first came about in approximately 1985, some 25 years ago, and everything should be updated. There is no doubt in my mind about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144341">However, under the act, the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> and government members, who are involved in whatever region that decision would have an impact upon, are constrained legally. I am distressed, to say the least, when certain members of the opposition, and I will not even bother to name them because they are inconsequential, bray at the moon and howl and scream when they know there are legally things that can and cannot be done. As a member of the democracy we call Canada and as a regional minister from Saskatchewan, when I look at the way some of the media and members of the opposition handled this I take affront to that. They went beyond the pale in their condemnations and their demands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144342">As we know, these companies are both major global players. Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan has holdings throughout the world, as does BHP, maybe on a different scale but similar in that they are international. The legislation is set out as it is because of market disruptions. Ripples that would go through the marketplace would send the incorrect and devastating signals to a lot of investors and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144343"> I commend the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, my Saskatchewan colleagues, the overall cabinet and caucus of this great government for keeping this interior. The ultimate decision rests with the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>. However, I know, from the Saskatchewan caucus perspective, we had some 17 meetings with all the stakeholders, everybody who had a role to play or something to say on this matter. We entertained that, took it to heart and passed it along to the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to help him make this decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144344">A lot of the discussion is all about politics. Certainly from the opposition side, I see that. When we go back and assess what those members have said and how they have done it, it was all about partisan politics. I think Canadians at the end of this will condemn them for that. Whenever the coalition decides to bring this government down and go to the polls, I think Canadians will remember the disrespectful way it handled itself in this instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144345">Now this is a one-up situation. There is a lot of discussion about how this would impact negatively Canada's place in the world when it comes to outside investment. That is absolutely ridiculous. These are all adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. More will happen. It could be today, or tomorrow or next week. We do not know. However, in a free-market enterprise like Canada, a democracy and the rule of law, we are a welcome investment. Look at the strength of our dollar. Look at the way we have come through this recession. A lot of countries entertain investment in Canada because of that stability, and we welcome that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144346">However, we certainly reserve the right to judge each one of these on a case-by-case basis as per the net benefit clause as set out in the act. It is what is in the best interests of Canada moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144347"> I can speak from an agricultural perspective. With the marketing we have done around the world now, in country after country, working with industry, working with my provincial colleagues, opening markets, rejuvenating markets, Canada is becoming of age again on the global stage. It had been dropped for some time. We were not really getting out there and doing the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144348"> When we arrive in a lot of these countries, one of the first things we are asked is where we have been. The Australians, the Americans, the European Union, Brazil, and some of the emerging economies like China and India are aggressive marketers and are getting to be more so. They welcomed us being there. They recognized the safety and security of the food supply in Canada. Part of that safety and security is also on the input side. When we look at a strategic resource like potash, which is the basis for fertilizers and so on around the world, we do a tremendous job of supplying both potash and foodstuffs, in a lot of cases to the same countries, for example, China, India, Korea. These are great markets for our fertilizers, as well as our finished foodstuffs. It gives us a power and a strategic position in the global food supply to be a major supplier of both the inputs and our crop and livestock production.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144349">From a strategic standpoint, we have that in spades in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144350">Under the net benefit, having someone different mine it certainly does make a difference in that Australia is a major marketer of a lot of the same foodstuffs that Canada has. We are a volume producer and so is Australia. For it to be able to go to the Indies and Chinas of the world and say that it now controls their fertilizer too, I think would have had a very detrimental effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144351">I know the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> took all of that under advisement and it helped him and his department formulate the decisions they have taken. At this time and place, it is absolutely the right decision. There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever. I think the Saskatchewan people have recognized the great work done by my colleagues and the Minister of Industry on this file. I think they also recognize the questionable attitude of some of the members of the opposition in trying to make partisan politics out of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144352">At the end of the day, the decision is based on the criteria that comes before the minister, straight up and that is it, and the right decision was made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144353">As we move forward, I am more than happy to have this debate about changing how we assess these because there will be more, not less. Canada is a land of wealth and riches. We have great raw materials. We have tremendous resource wealth. As we strive to open up our Canadian north, which we have done as a government, and secured that sovereignty there and as we look at our fresh water supplies and the growing demand around the world, we will have to come to grips with that demand from the rest of the world to either invest or buy outright these types of commodities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144354">At this time and place, we can say no because we do have some guidelines. Could they be better guidelines? Probably. We are looking at things that are in demand now that never were when this act was written in 1985.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144355">I welcome the opportunity and the motion from the NDP. I take exception to some of the political undertones in it. The last line is an outright denial. I do not think we can do that in a free and democratic society in a global stage, where we are becoming and growing rightfully into a major player.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144356">Some of this is couched in politics. That is what we do here and I welcome that. I love the rough and tumble of it. We get our elbows up in the corner. It is like a good hockey game. However, at the end of the day, there are rules and regulations and the referee is the Canadian people. They will adjudicate this deal. We are aware of the fact that a growing number of Canadian residents and a growing number of Canadian businesses, which are free traders, support this decision in the way it is written.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144357">When I read editorials in certain papers and at certain authors who claim to be on the inside track, I wonder how they justify their stance to their subscribers and advertising purchasers. I also look through the lens of an opposition that votes for things like <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>, which in a global situation, and PCS and BHP Billiton are part of that, would condemn them and force them to continually fight a rear flank action with causes and situations that come up in some global outpost somewhere. We would have to shut down production on behalf of PCS and adjudicate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144358">I also look at the opposition's stance on raising the tax on business. Part of what draws investment to Canada is that lower tax rate. All the opposition members stand in question period and condemn us for moving forward with tax cuts to business. They all go on about big business. However, the tax cuts pertain to little guys too. Every business in Canada is important. Businesses are the growth of the economy. They are the job creators. They are the engine of the economy. Everyone gets that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144359">Why do those members condemn tax cuts as we come out of the recession? We have seen net job growth in Canada, unlike our closest ally in the U.S. We see stability in our systems in Canada, unlike the turmoil in our closest partner, the U.S. We see a growing acceptance of Canada on the world stage. We see a growing acceptance that Canada can do more. I cannot understand their stance, other than it is a pure crass political situation. I condemn that, but I welcome the opportunity to have this debate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2144376">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate today about potash. It is a commodity that many people may not have heard much about, at least not until six or eight weeks ago. But since then, potash has become a symbol of how Canadians value and measure the public interest and the strategic interests of our country. That is not something they want sold out or taken over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144377">Potash is a mineral nutrient that is a vital ingredient in fertilizers, and 53% of the world's known reserves are located in Saskatchewan. Potash is used to renew and enrich arable farm lands. It is indispensable to food production worldwide and will be so for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144378">Our soil types here in Canada are different from many others around the world. We do not use a lot of potash in our country, at least not yet. One day we most certainly will. In the meantime, its strategic value in feeding a hungry world is indisputable and is growing more strategic and more valuable every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144379">It came as a surprise to many, about two weeks ago, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> answered a potash question in this House in a remarkably superficial and dismissive manner. In reference to the hostile bid by the massive transnational BHP Billiton Corporation of Australia to take over the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, essentially, “What is all the fuss? It is just an Australian company trying to buy out an American company, so who really cares?” That was the tone of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144380">As it turns out, millions of Canadians care, and they care deeply. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was wrong about the Potash Corporation. It is not an American company, 49% of its shareholders are Canadian and only 38% are American. More important, two-thirds of its directors are Canadian citizens and Canadian residents. Control of the company rests in Canada, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144381">Beyond being erroneous, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s remark was taken by a lot of people in Saskatchewan as an insult, an indication that Saskatchewan was being taken for granted again and maybe taken to the cleaners, that Saskatchewan's interests could easily be sacrificed on the altar of ultra-Conservative ideology, sold out to Australia because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had a personal bias in favour of the proposed takeover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144382">That is how Saskatchewan read the Conservative position two weeks ago. The government was out of sync with a big majority of Saskatchewan people who did not want, and do not want, to stand by and see this transaction result in the biggest resource sellout in history. They do not want to lose control, permanently and irretrievably, over this strategic commodity and an entire industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144383">Offended by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s foolish remark, public opinion galvanized and mobilized. The Saskatchewan government and the provincial legislature were of one mind on this issue. If anyone knows the politics of Saskatchewan, that is indeed a rare moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144384">Premier Wall was buttressed by former premiers Calvert, Romano, Devine, and Blakeney, and the opposition accumulated far beyond Saskatchewan. Former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed weighed in, as did the current premiers of Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec, and New Brunswick. The Ontario finance minister warned the federal government to listen carefully to Saskatchewan. And as the official opposition in the House of Commons, we issued the same warning for six long weeks, day after day, question period after question period, .</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144385">The wave of common opinion rolled beyond politics. Icons of Canadian business became very vocal. Early out of the gate to oppose the deal was Stephen Jarislowsky of Montreal, who owns an estimated some 9 million shares of Potash Corp., and stood to make a tidy profit at $130 per share. He said, “No, do not do it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144386">The same counsel came from the legendary Dick Haskayne of Calgary, the man for whom the business school at the University of Calgary is named. He, too, said, “No, do not do it.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144387">Then Roger Phillips of Regina, former vice-president of Alcan when it was a Canadian company and later CEO at IPSCO Steel, said no as well. From there, the list of those with substantial misgivings just kept growing. Norman Keevil of Teck Resources, Dominic D'Allesandro, Calin Rovinescu of Air Canada, Roger Martin of the Rotman School, Gerry Schwartz of Onex, Red Wilson, and many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144388">The questions being asked were all much the same. If the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan were to be sold out to BHP, control over the operation would move from a board in Saskatoon, where two-thirds of the directors are Canadian, to a very different foreign board in Australia, with maybe one Canadian director out of 11. So how is that a net benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144389">If Saskatchewan stands to lose jobs, investment, and provincial government revenues totalling between $3 billion and $6 billion, how is that a net benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144390"> If the deal means the inevitable destruction of the Canpotex marketing group and the muscling out of other players like Agrium and Mosaic, how is that a net benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144391"> If the biggest resources sell-out in Canadian history adds potash to the list of Alcan, Inco, and Falconbridge, all former Canadian champions now lost from Canadian ownership, lost from Canadian control under this Conservative government, how is that a net benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144392">If Saskatchewan and Canada lose all effective influence over one of the world's most strategic commodities in food production, especially in burgeoning markets in India and China at a time when these economies are poised to begin driving the global economy, if we give up that influence, how is that a net benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144393">If Canada's image is reinforced on the global stage as a corporate pushover, an easy mark for takeovers, or if people are led to believe, to use the words of none other than the former chairman of BHP, that “Canada's policies are the worst...Canada has been reduced to an industry branch office largely irrelevant on the global mining stage”, then where is the net benefit in letting BHP take over?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144394">We asked all of these questions over and over again in the House of Commons. Business leaders asked them too, as did the province of Saskatchewan. After weeks of interrogation, the government has finally admitted that it cannot find any net benefit either. Because this was so obvious for so long, people are left to wonder what the government was really thinking during all that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144395">It goes back to the answer from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> two weeks ago. This is a government that wanted to say yes, that planned to say yes, until the Conservatives saw themselves threatened politically. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144396">The Conservatives polled furiously over this past weekend. They leaked a bunch of trial balloons to the news media to see what might fly. They tried to test what would sell, so that they could ride a horse in two different directions at the same time, but the reaction was all consistently negative. They could not make a silk purse out of this sow's ear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144397">In the end, they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to get on the same side as a strong majority of Canadians and an overwhelming majority of Saskatchewanians, and just say no. Even then, their position remained a bit vague. Yes, the rules require a 30-day response period for BHP, but in fairness to the corporation, it should not be drawn into some kind of wild goose chase. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144398">The people of Saskatchewan have not said maybe. They have unequivocally said no. The Premier of Saskatchewan has not said, “Make me a better offer”. He has said unequivocally no. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144399">BHP officials should know what is in their power to address and what is not. Could they do better on the share price, jobs, investment, provincial taxes and royalties, or the size of their Saskatoon branch office? Maybe. But as Premier Wall points out, how could they address the fundamental strategic considerations that go far beyond merely haggling over the price?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144400">In other words, Saskatchewan's potash resources are clearly so strategic, how does BHP officials render those resources unstrategic? In a hungry world in which soil fertilization is vital, how do they diminish control over 53% of the global supply of potash to nothing more than the routine marketing of axe handles? If it is special and it is strategic and BHP cannot change that, then why lead it on? Yes, give the 30 days that the law requires, but do not raise false hopes on the part of the bidder and do not cause doubts among Saskatchewan people about what the answer is. When it comes to potash, no means no. That is what 80% or more of Saskatchewan people want to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144401">They do not want to be told that they are bad or weak people because they expect their governments to stand up and safeguard a strategic resource. Some of the extremist commentary that has been pedalled about Saskatchewan being a banana republic and the premier being some kind of Hugo Chavez of the north is just ideological claptrap. The cream of Canada's business leadership says that standing up for a strategic resource and standing against this particular transaction is not anti-business and not anti-investment, it is simply the right thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144402">Canada's global reputation is not that we are too tough on foreign direct investments. It is that we are too soft, to the point where even the former chairman of BHP was making fun of us. Neither Australia nor any other sophisticated economy would rubber-stamp a deal like the foreign takeover of PotashCorp. The right-wing Conservative elites who make the contrary argument are the same people who opposed robust financial regulations and promoted big bank mergers about a decade ago. If their bad advice had been followed then, Canada's financial system would have suffered the same big trouble as the American system that so damaged the U.S. economy through the recession of the last two years. A strong legal framework and robust oversight are not bad for business but the Investment Canada process does need to be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144403"> Early in this debate, several weeks ago, the Liberal official opposition made that very point and we called for four types of changes. The first one was that there needed to be more precision in the definition of what constitutes a net benefit under the Investment Canada Act. Right now it is a bit of a moveable feast. It is vague, it is whatever the minister says that it is from time to time and it changes from time to time. For all sides in the debate about foreign direct investment there needs to be more clarity about what net benefit means. To this very moment, BHP still believes that it passed the test. To a big majority of Canadians, it is beyond doubt that it did not pass the test and perhaps could not. Such ambiguity is not helpful to any side in a large, complex commercial transaction. So number one is that there be greater certainty in the definition of net benefit and the factors that determine it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144404">The second change concerns transparency. As it exists today, the Investment Canada process is a totally secret black box. No one knows the information that goes in or the arguments that are exchanged. No one knows what analysis if any gets done and no one knows the basis upon which recommendations are made. We have the bizarre situation here in the BHP case where the minister says that there was an analysis but that there were no recommendations. Well, how silly is that, an analysis without recommendations? Equally silly is that any conditions attached to any government approvals are also secret. Now that is ludicrous. If the public cannot know what the conditions for an approval are, then how can there be any measurement of performance? Provisions need to be embedded in the legislation to ensure proper public disclosure of necessary information and a more transparent procedure in the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144405">The third change concerns enforcement. As we have seen all too often since 2006, big promises are too often made by takeover bidders in order to close their deals, only to be broken within a few scant months thereafter.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144406">The practical experience on this front has been bitterly disappointing to a great many Canadians. It is not good enough to say “then sue them”. Where would that get us? Litigation would be tied up in the courts for 10 years or more while Canadians lose their jobs. The act needs to be amended to include practical, timely, readily available remedies to enforce any promises that are made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144407">Fourth, as we have seen in the Potash case, this federal jurisdiction over foreign direct investment can impinge squarely upon provincial constitutional jurisdiction over natural resources. Premier Wall was prepared, if necessary, to take that question to court as the people of Saskatchewan would have expected him to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144408">While the Investment Canada Act cannot resolve every question of constitutional jurisdiction, it can at least obligate the federal authority to consult more closely and to keep profoundly affected provinces more effectively in the decision-making loop. They deserve some recognized status in this whole procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144409">The motion before us today is by no means a panacea. Some of its proposals are useful while some may not be workable or even desirable, but at least a discussion needs to begin on how to improve the Investment Canada Act and its procedures as we called for about a month ago. That discussion needs to get going before there is another megatakeover looming on the horizon. The Potash case has demonstrated that the present regime is not adequate, so let us get it fixed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144410">In the meantime, this motion in its last sentence says clearly that the BHP takeover bid needs to be stopped. That is the primary message in this motion today that I hope all members will endorse.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144411">Mr. Speaker, for a while I thought I was listening to an NDP member. The Liberals when in opposition can talk a great line and sound progressive but their history in government is something quite different. In fact, when they were in government they stopped absolutely zero in terms of foreign takeovers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144412">I want to take the member back to November 2, 1989, when Grant Devine was the Conservative premier of Saskatchewan. The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan was privatized. For many years it had been government owned and very successful. It was privatized by a Conservative government at that time. Mulroney was the prime minister at the time and the Liberals were the official opposition but I do not recall the Liberal Party of Canada taking a strong position against that particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144413"> Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>, the corporate social responsibility bill sponsored by a Liberal member, which was recently before the House, would have forced Canadian mining companies to act responsibly in foreign jurisdictions and treat workers and the environment fairly. The member's own party held out sufficient members when it came time to vote so his colleague lost his bill. That is the way the opposition acts. The Liberals sit on both sides of issues but particularly with Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144415">Mr. Speaker, it is hard to know if a question was actually buried there. It seemed to be more like a rhetorical statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144416">The fact is that in the lifespan of the Investment Canada Act, going back to the mid-eighties, there has not been a proposed transaction in the resources sector in the order of magnitude as the Potash case. This is the first one that has been this big, and we have been very clear about our position on the case of Potash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144417">We have also indicated that the major takeovers of large chunks of Canadian natural resources, whether that was Inco, Falconbridge or Alcan, they have all occurred since 2006 under the watch of the present government, not the previous government. I think the hon. member should pay a little more attention to the timeframe and direct his criticism where it belongs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144418">The stripping away of Canada's ownership of its natural resources in terms of the control factor has all occurred since 2006. If Potash were to be added to the list of Inco, Alcan and Falconbridge, many in the Canadian business community would look over the horizon and ask, “What is left? It is all gone”. It is very clearly time to draw the line in the case of Potash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144419">On the issue of Bill <Document DbId="4327824" Type="4">C-300</Document>, I would point out to the hon. gentleman that in the course of that vote, every Liberal in the House voted in favour and there were members of Parliament missing from all political parties at the time that vote was taken.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144422">Mr. Speaker, of course not. The point is that the government has been trying on this issue to have it all ways to Sunday and not to be clear with Canadians about where it wanted to go. We heard that in the answer that was given by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> two weeks ago yesterday when he was asked the question about Potash and gave that flippant, dismissive response that said, “Who cares? It is just an Australian company trying to buy an American company and it really does not matter”.</ParaText>

They knew it was factually wrong to start with but they were offended by the dismissive, back of the hand kind of approach that they saw from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.

I will not put those epithets into the record because they are pretty tough, but they are described as MPs who are missing in action, who scurry away from the microphones, who refuse to take a position, refuse to stand up for Saskatchewan and only take a position after the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has told them what they think.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144436">That is the kind of taking for granted of Saskatchewan that the province roundly resents. That is why the notion of having a one-party political monopoly on Saskatchewan is something that province is very anxious not to have.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144444">Mr. Speaker, every time I have the opportunity to speak in the House of Commons, I try to find out whether the bill, the motion or the debate directly affects the people of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, the riding I represent in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144445">Although this matter is unfolding far from Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, we recently went through something very similar. When I read the text of the NDP motion, it struck a chord with me. Three years ago, on October 18, 2007, I condemned the then industry minister's lack of forethought in the Rio Tinto takeover of the Alcan Group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144446">Before going any further, I would like to spend a few minutes on the text of the motion before us. There are some similarities between the Potash Corporation takeover, the subject of today's motion, and the Alcan file. The length of the motion no doubt is representative of the many problems with the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144447">The Investment Canada Act, which covers the review of foreign investment, is complex but has some shortcomings. At present, the act gives too much latitude to the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> and is too complacent with respect to foreign corporations. We must establish a more transparent process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144448">I will present the Bloc Québécois's position right away. On the very eve of the debate on the motion—yesterday, November 3, 2010 at 6 p.m.—the Conservative government finally decided to block the current transaction by declaring that there was no net benefit to Canada. However, rather than slamming the door shut, the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> left it open a crack by giving BHP Billiton the opportunity to submit a better offer within 30 days. In short, the matter is not settled and the Conservative government may still allow the foreign takeover of Potash Corporation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144449">Even though, this time, public outcry and the Saskatchewan premier's opposition forced the Conservative government to use the Investment Canada Act to block the transaction, it is the exception to the rule. In general, the Conservatives pay little heed to foreign takeovers of Quebec and Canadian corporations. Even worse, the Conservative government makes a point of making decisions in a vacuum, without respecting the positions of the major players: the representatives of workers and the industry and, above all, the governments of Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144450">Do we need to remind the government that natural resources, as in the case of Potash Corporation, come under the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces? The Conservative government's position is quite worrisome because the flow of foreign investment has been increasing internationally for years, particularly in the natural resources sector. Natural resources have a strategic significance that foreign countries crave, and Quebec and Canada need to make sure that they do not lose control of those resources. The international business environment is in favour of international trade and foreign takeovers of Quebec's industry icons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144451">The importance of these industries for Quebec goes beyond trade and encompasses the total economic and social development of our society. Foreign takeovers have often resulted in job losses and a loss of control over business decisions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144452">Many trade agreements include a dispute settlement mechanism allowing foreign investors to contest legislative measures unfavourable to their financial interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144453">In the March 2010 Speech from the Throne, the Conservative government expressed its intention to facilitate foreign takeovers in a number of our key sectors including satellites, telecommunications and mines. Foreign investment should be synonymous with new capital, economic growth and job creation, instead of just foreign takeovers of our well-established industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144454">The current wording of the Investment Canada Act already allows the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to consult representatives from industry, the labour market, provincial and local governments and any other interested parties. The motion aims to make these consultations mandatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144455">The Conservative government has already quietly amended the Investment Canada Act through the Budget Implementation Act, 2009, which made it possible to raise the threshold for review by Industry Canada to $1 billion simply by an order in council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144456">The Conservative government's approach does not promote transparency or inspire the confidence of the House in its actions with respect to this kind of transaction. The federal government should respect decisions that Quebec and the provinces make about foreign takeovers, particularly since Potash Corporation operates in the natural resources sector, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144457">The Bloc Québécois supports the NDP motion we are debating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144458">As I said at the beginning of my remarks about today's NDP motion, we all know how important Alcan is to Quebec. In my region, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, the news that Rio Tinto was buying Alcan was like a bomb going off. There were a lot of unknowns surrounding the transaction. Things were going to change. Would plans change? Alcan became foreign-owned. Our dams and our rivers became, in part, foreign property. That is worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144459">Before the Alcan-Rio Tinto transaction, the company had its headquarters in Quebec. The resources were Quebec's property and the capital was mostly in Quebec and Canadian hands. Today, the company is headquartered abroad. Our resources are foreign property and most of the capital is elsewhere. Alcan's Montreal headquarters are now a Rio Tinto administrative office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144460">Because the company's decision-making hub is no longer in Quebec, the shareholders' meeting on Rio Tinto's business activities in North America is now held in London.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144461">For the past three years, I have crossed the Atlantic with other elected representatives or people representing employees at Rio Tinto plants in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean to ask the London-based Rio Tinto executives some questions. These issues are so important to the region that it wants to make sure its message gets heard where decisions get made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144462">Before Rio Tinto acquired the company, shareholders' meetings were held in Montreal. Company leaders were nearby. When people talked about Saguenay—Lac-St-Jean in Montreal, the issues were well known. Now, in London, in a huge room full of groups from dozens of countries, each with their own issues, it is harder to get the message through. Also, in Montreal, people could express themselves in French because some of the top brass were our own. In London, it is a whole different story.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144463">I am not trying to prevent the sale of Canadian businesses to foreign companies. I simply believe that the Canadian government has the tools needed to ensure that the transaction will have a positive, significant impact on our economy, our workers and our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144464">In fact, the Investment Canada Act allows the federal government to impose conditions when a Canadian company or business is being bought by a foreign investor. For instance, that legislation allows the government to authorize or refuse a transaction after examining whether it will benefit Canada. For me, the case that comes to mind is Rio Tinto and Alcan. The <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> did not express any objections or impose any conditions on Rio Tinto in 2007. To this day, I have a hard time really understanding how a company as large as Alcan, which was the pride and joy of the Quebec economy, could have been sold without anyone really taking a close look at the impact of such a decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144465">The Bloc Québécois and a number of stakeholders in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean called for conditions, but the minister at the time ignored those demands. He pulled the rug right out from under our feet. He rushed to make a decision and hastily accepted the transaction. Unfortunately, Rio Tinto has since acquired Alcan. The minister did not demand any commitments from Rio Tinto concerning the number of jobs to be preserved, although that should have been a priority in the process. Nor did he demand any commitments regarding secondary and tertiary aluminum processing activities in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean or even in Quebec. As a result, an entire legacy built by people in my region ended up being sold off in just a few days. It seems logical to me that in such a situation, someone should ask some questions and impose certain conditions on the new owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144466">Since the NDP motion mentions Potash Corporation, I would like to talk about this saga. Potash Corporation extracts potash, which is a rare mineral that is used in fertilizers. Potash Corporation used to be state-owned but it was privatized in 1989 and now owns nearly 20% of the world's potash reserves. In mid-August 2010, BHP Billiton, an Anglo-Australian mining company, made a hostile takeover bid to the shareholders of Potash Corporation for a total sum of $28.5 billion, or $130 a share. This hostile bid sparked an immediate reaction from Potash Corporation's management, who essentially called it robbery. BHP Billiton also repeated its promise to keep the company's headquarters in Saskatchewan and to transfer the management team from its potash division to the province and maintain the same number of jobs there. Potash Corporation responded by taking legal action in American courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144467">Potash Corporation is special to the people of Saskatchewan and is a source of pride for the province. This explains the hostile reaction that this takeover bid sparked from the people of Saskatchewan. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">premier</Affiliation> even spoke out publicly against this transaction, which he deemed to be strategically unacceptable for the economic future of his province. He also felt that this transaction did not offer any net benefit for the country, as is required by the Investment Canada Act. From a financial point of view, Saskatchewan could stand to lose up to $3 billion a year in royalties if Potash Corporation were sold to foreign investors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144468">I would like to take this opportunity to present the Bloc's requests regarding this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144469">Considering the fact that there is a dispute settlement regime favourable to foreign investments on the international scene, and that a limit of $1 billion could make it possible for many outstanding assets of Quebec's economy to be sold to foreign investors without the government even having an opportunity to determine whether the takeover would be of net benefit to the local economy, the Bloc Québécois is suggesting that these provisions be abandoned and that the threshold be set at $300 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144470">This amount would allow foreign investments in Canada without unnecessarily putting a stop to them, but major investments above this threshold would be reviewed before being approved. Thus, the government would have a right to review the nature of major foreign takeovers and the risks associated with them and would be able to determine the foreign investors' intentions regarding the management of their Canadian assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144471">It is up to the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to decide whether the proposed investment is of net benefit to Canada. Unfortunately, when a foreign company and the government negotiate an agreement, it is classified as confidential. I can understand that a private company does not want to show its hand. However, I sincerely believe that certain terms and conditions must be established and made public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144472">As my speech has indicated, there is no doubt that the Bloc Québécois is in favour of the NDP motion. I repeat, we are not against the foreign acquisition of Canadian companies, but I believe it is important to set more transparent standards and require commitments that will help ensure the future of the company. That is what I would have liked to see in the 2007 transaction when Rio Tinto acquired Alcan. The minister at the time had not set any conditions. The regional community called for two conditions: that a certain number of jobs be created and that the aluminum be processed in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144473">In closing, in comparing yesterday's decision to the one made in 2007, we see that there is a double standard when it comes to Quebec. For strategic reasons, the Conservative government intervened yesterday to say that the sale of this company would not go through, but in the case of Alcan, the government did not intervene and was negligent in not setting any conditions. Does the Conservative government think that natural resources are less important in Quebec?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144474">The Conservative government did not intervene for political reasons. This issue mobilized people, governments and the industry in Saskatchewan. In my region, in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation> did nothing to pressure the Minister of Industry. The then minister, the current minister and hon. member for Jonquière—Alma, and the Conservative government have all demonstrated gross negligence.</ParaText>

I would have liked to have asked it of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> before he scurried away from his seat shortly after his speech. I will just give a bit of history to my Bloc friends regarding the member for Wascana. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144476">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> was the provincial Liberal leader for some time in that province before he escaped to Ottawa. He was kind of lonely there, being the only, lonely Liberal for a period of time. Now he has come here and history repeats itself, I guess, insofar as he is the only, lonely Liberal in the whole province, surrounded by a sea of 13 Conservatives, and he does not much like that. He does not particularly like the fact that he is no longer in the government, in the government caucus, in the cabinet. He can yap and yip all he wants on that side because he does not have disclosure restraints. There are no criminal sanctions that would apply to him as a member of the opposition, yipping and yapping on the other side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144477">The members from the Conservative Party, the 13 of us here in this place, take our responsibility seriously in providing the kind of input that the minister requests as he gathers all the input he requires for a very serious and very sobering kind of decision. At the end of the day, the minister, as he has rightly said, made a good decision, that it does not present a likely net benefit to Canada, in respect of the Billiton bid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144478">I would remind the Bloc member and the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> who was here in his seat talking some moments ago that the current Liberal leader in the province of Saskatchewan actually said in public comments that this should be wide open, that we should just let it happen, that the government should not be involved at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144479">So it is fine for the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> to flail his arms and all of that in this place, to flap his arms and his gums, I guess I would say, but what does the Bloc member think of the fact that the federal Liberals rubber-stamp everything and the provincial Liberal leader said it should just be left open, when in fact--</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2144484">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for his comments today. The fact of the matter is that it was the previous Conservative government of Grant Devine in Saskatchewan that privatized Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan on November 2, 1989. It is a corporation that was very successfully operated for many years under the ownership and management of the people of Saskatchewan, and the ideological Conservative government of Grant Devine privatized it in 1989. What did the federal Conservative government of Brian Mulroney do at the time? No concerns were expressed at all. The Liberal opposition did not seem to be concerned about it at all. That was the beginning of the problems with regard to this particular deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144485">The statistics overall point to a very sorry record of successive Conservative and Liberal governments. For example, in 1,638 foreign takeovers, there were 334 just last year alone and only one was disallowed by the Canadian government. In 2009, the government reviewed only 22 out of 338 takeovers, according to Industry Canada. In one year alone, 2006, foreign control over Canada's mining sector rose from 12% to 40%. Between 1985 when the Investment Canada Act came into force under Brian Mulroney and September 30, 2010, Industry Canada reviewed, once again, 1,638 foreign acquisition worth almost $600 billion and approved all but one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144486">So the fact of the matter is that, historically, whether it is Conservative or Liberal, it is the same thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144490">Xstrata, which was Falconbridge, and Inco, which is now Vale, have both seen the net benefit. The net benefit has been 686 job losses in February 2009, 400 job losses at Vale in May and a year-long strike. I can continue to talk about job losses, and I can continue to talk about layoffs, but the thing that has been very clear is that my city and my community has been ravaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144491"> There has been no net benefit to families who have to find a way to keep their homes and no net benefit to families who are not able to send their children, their teenagers, to college or university because they have lost their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144492">This net benefit needs to be clear. I got elected two years ago, and when the first layoffs came around, it was six months in. I said we would look at the Investment Canada Act and the agreement and find out what we could do to protect the jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144493">What I was told by the government was that it was a confidential agreement and I could not see it. However, it was allowing a corporation to lay off 686 people, with 686 families affected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144495">Madam Speaker, the case that the member just presented could be considered plausible. It is not fair. I think that this transaction was grossly mismanaged. The minister at the time should have fixed undertakings and conditions for the company prior to the transaction. There should have been conditions—for example, a certain number of jobs—or else the transaction would have been cancelled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144496">That is what we are calling for. The motion also calls for a minimum amount of transparency so that the public can be informed. The minister must pay attention. The Investment Canada Act allows the minister to listen to what the Quebec and provincial governments, the community and the workers are calling for and to fix undertakings and conditions before the transaction takes place. That is what we need. The minister must defend the public. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144497">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> this morning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144498">I am delighted to participate in today's debate on our NDP motion to amend the Investment Canada Act. It is a debate that is long overdue in this country, and last night's interim decision on the sale of PotashCorp only reinforces that point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144499">The industry minister said that there is “likely no benefit” to Canada and Canadians but that BHP Billiton has 30 days to respond. The very use of the word “likely” suggests that there may be some doubts still in the mind of the minister, but we will never know for sure because everything is happening behind closed doors. There is no transparency. Without transparency there cannot be any accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144500">We will never know why the government is rejecting the BHP Billiton bid for PotashCorp, nor will we ever know why it has rubber-stamped so many other takeovers in the past. Yet this is a critically important issue for literally thousands of Canadians and communities from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144501">It is the Investment Canada Act that creates the legislative framework for the review of proposals for foreign takeovers of Canadian companies. It is this law that requires the government to turn down such proposals if they are of no net benefit to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144502">Since 1985, more than 13,500 Canadian firms have fallen to foreign interests under successive Liberal and Conservative governments. Until last night's partial rejection of a bid only one foreign takeover application had ever been turned down before, and that was the bid for MacDonald Dettwiler. MacDonald Dettwiler of course is the company that produced the Canadarm and other strategic space technologies, which were sought after by a U.S. weapons contractor. Thankfully that takeover bid was denied, but it was the exception, not the rule.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144503">An astonishing 87% of foreign takeovers were approved without ever being reviewed. How could it be otherwise when in the entire federal government there are only 11 people charged with the responsibility of reviewing the hundreds of proposals coming forward, and 2 of those staff are in clerical positions? By default, Canada's businesses have become ripe for the picking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144504">No one is safe. Foreign interests have already absorbed Canadian icons like Stelco, Molson, Labatt, Inco, The Bay, Falconbridge, Alcan, Nortel and even the Montreal Canadiens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144505">Canada as we know it is simply slipping away. Foreign-based companies are gaining more and more control over our strategic industries like steel and nickel, as well as our energy reserves, natural resources and cultural industries. Over and over again, Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to ensure that foreign investments create new jobs for Canadians, bring new capital to Canada, transfer new technology to this country, increase Canadian-based research and development, contribute to sustainable economic development and improve the lives of Canadian workers and their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144506">Only if those conditions are met should the government feel assured that new proposals are indeed a net benefit and be prepared to sign off on a foreign takeover. Instead foreign investments have been motivated simply by a desire to gain control of Canada's strategic industries and resources. Sadly that seems to be just fine by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144507">A perfect case in point is the recent takeover by U.S. Steel of Hamilton icon, Stelco. It provides the cautionary tale of an approved takeover gone terribly awry. Let me give members of the House a little background on what happened in Hamilton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144508">U.S. Steel acquired the former operations of Stelco Inc. in 2007. That included both Hilton Works in Hamilton and Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke. Under the Investment Canada Act, U.S. Steel had to demonstrate that its investment would provide a net benefit to Canada. As a result, it had to make commitments with respect to job creation, production levels and domestic investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144509">To that end, U.S. Steel and the Government of Canada signed an agreement that committed U.S. Steel to 31 different undertakings and promises. U.S. Steel then started up its operations in the fall of 2007. Just a year later, layoffs began at Hilton Works and in 2009 at the Lake Erie Works as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144510">In the spring of 2009, the government started to ask questions and U.S. Steel responded with a host of reasons of why it is excused or ought to be excused from meeting its employment and production commitments. These excuses did not fly, and so the government took U.S. Steel to court in July of last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144511">The Steelworkers and Lakeside, a company with a potential interest in acquiring U.S. Steel operations, were granted intervenor status. This was a huge victory for the Steelworkers. Winning intervenor status is rare in cases such as these, but the court said that the union had “unique interests” that ought to be considered in determining an appropriate remedy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144512">U.S. Steel, of course, did not just roll over. In September 2009, the company went back to court challenging the constitutionality of the entire act. Thankfully, in June of this year the judge dismissed U.S. Steel's claim. Once again U.S. Steel filed an appeal and then asked for a stay. The court did not grant the stay application, but to this day the charter challenge is continuing through the courts. In the meantime, U.S. Steel is expected to file its materials from the original case and the hearing will likely be some time in 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144513">Where does that leave us today? I think a number of issues are thrown into relief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144514">First, by taking U.S. Steel to court the federal government has acknowledged that it does have a legal duty to ensure that foreign investments provide a net benefit to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144515">Second, the case makes it clear that commitments made by foreign corporations with respect to job creation, production levels and domestic investment are legally binding. They are not fair-weather wish lists that foreign corporations can unilaterally abandon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144516">Both of those things are good news. But, and this is a big but, clearly they are not ironclad guarantees. If they were, it would not have been possible for the government to take U.S. Steel to court while taking no action against Vale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144517">Vale permanently cut hundreds of jobs from its Canadian operations, and yet the government did not take Vale to court. Why is that? What was it in Vale's agreement that was different from the agreement with U.S. Steel?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144518">Herein lies the crux of the problem. We do not know. We do not know because the agreements between foreign corporations and the federal government under the Investment Canada Act are negotiated in private and are never made publicly available. It does not need to be that way, and it should not be that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144519">That is why our motion proposes two critical changes to the Investment Canada Act. First, public hearings must be made a mandatory part of all foreign investment reviews and those hearings have to be open to all those who are directly affected as well as any expert witnesses that they choose to call on their behalf. This would mean that there would be worker participation in the reviews of foreign takeovers. Unions must be at the table so that any agreements can ultimately be enforced through the collective agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144520">Second, the agreements must be made public. The single biggest challenge to holding companies to their commitments under the act is not knowing what commitments were made in the first place. That is why our motion demands that all conditions attached to the approval of a takeover be made public and be accompanied by equally transparent commitments to monitoring corporate performance on those conditions and appropriate and enforceable penalties for failure to live up to those conditions. In essence, we are creating a legal requirement for transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144521">As it stands now, enforcement is spotty at best. Even where the government is taking action, workers have to rely on the courts to decide on the appropriate remedy. The court may order fines, divestment, compliance or some combination thereof. But it is the workers who need to be made whole, and the best way to do that is to ensure that they are part of the process from day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144522">The alternative is what is playing out in Hamilton right now. The <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> came to Hamilton and said that he had sympathy for the workers, who are likely to be locked out by U.S. Steel at the end of this week, but that there was nothing he could do. That was on October 15. As U.S.W. Local 1005 rightly pointed out, the minister was “factually wrong, socially irresponsible and politically stupid”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144523">The agreement signed with U.S. Steel did not expire until October 31, so the company could not, as the minister suggested, “make decisions, good, bad or indifferent, according to their timetable and responsibilities”. U.S. Steel was still bound by its agreement with the federal government, but the minister simply threw up his hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144524">Taking a company to court is one thing, but the cavalier attitude displayed by the minister in Hamilton means that reform of the system is desperately needed. The enforcement of foreign takeover agreements cannot be left in the hands of ministers who are not on top of their files. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144525">Canadians deserve better, and our motion delivers better, because our Canada is not for sale.</ParaText>

It sounds to me too similar to when we look at what happened to Sudbury. The largest nickel copper resource in the world was allowed to be basically vandalized under the minister's watch. He told the people of Sudbury, in the face of the shutdowns, the layoffs and the crippling strike, that we would look back and remember that Vale came to save Sudbury at the time when Inco was dying. It was not only factually incorrect, it was one of the most idiotic statements a Canadian minister could ever make because four years ago Inco was at the top of the base metal mining game. If we were to talk to anyone in the mining industry they would tell us that the merger between Inco and Falconbridge would have created synergies that were unprecedented. It was under the minister's watch and the government's watch that this industry was devastated.</ParaText>

At first, things seemed okay, but then the economic crisis happened. It seems that many corporations used this crisis as a way to bend some of the rules and have layoffs.

Stopping the BHP takeover is the first step in helping make that happen, because the last thing we want to see is more of the losses, more of the negative side of the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144550">We are talking about transparency commitments to monitoring corporate performance on those conditions and appropriate and enforceable penalties for failure to live up to those conditions. When we lost 686 jobs at Xtrata, when we had 400 layoffs at Vale, and when we had a strike for over a year, there was no way we could find out if there should be any type of penalty enforced on these companies because we could not find out what the agreement entailed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144551">That is the unfortunate thing about this. How do we know if the agreement said that there could be no layoffs and no strikes for the first three or four years or there would be penalties? We do not know. Maybe the companies should have been forced to make some payments and suffer some penalties that could have offset some of the costs that these laid off workers were experiencing. However, when we do not know we do not know how to deal with the situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144552">Maybe the agreement was of benefit to the corporation and the government but we do not know. The reason we are asking for transparency is so we can go back to our constituents and look the people in the eye who are being affected and say, “This is the agreement. This is what the government signed on your behalf. You can agree or disagree with it, but this is what the agreement is right now”. People could respect that, but when we hide behind this wall with no transparency, the people who have lost their jobs just do not get that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144553">What we are hoping for is that this motion will start the talk and bring forward the commitment to ensure foreign investment enriches our communities instead of hollowing them out. I could look three hours to the west of Sudbury, my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128382" Type="2">Sault Ste. Marie</Affiliation> can attest to this, and we have had a foreign investment with S.R. Steel. I do not know all the details of the agreement with S.R. Steel like I do with Vale and Xtrata, but S.R. Steel has become a good corporate citizen in that community. It is involved with its United Way campaign, and as the former executive director of the United Way in Sudbury, I know it is involved there as well. It has been involved with trying to maintain the Huron Central Railway. It has been an advocate to ensure that we keep this vital link between Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie. It is ensuring that its employees have an opportunity to have a say in discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144554">When we look at what happened at Vale and Xtrata with the takeovers from Falconbridge and Inco, the miners who are actually down 7,000, almost 8,000 feet below the surface working for this company, would they not know what is best to ensure that the company is being profitable and find ways of improving production? Would they not know how to work with their foreman? Instead, these people have been completely kept in the dark. They have not been told what they can get involved with. They have not been told how the company is being affected, because again, the Investment Canada Act is hidden. It is not transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144555">That one part of our motion today is critical, in my opinion, to ensuring that we can bring forward this issue and end the hidden agenda, it seems, that is coming forward with the current Investment Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144556">Many times I have sat in my office with many of the miners, laid off miners and people who have been affected by the corporate takeovers and they always ask what they need to do to get this information out. I tell them that they need to continue to advocate on their own behalf because it is our belief that this motion to ensure that the act is more transparent will protect workers and families, and, if we get the right type of investment, we can create jobs, technology and research development.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144565">Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague is from a mining and smelting community and I am from a mining town. We are no strangers to heartbreak. We have seen mines close. We have seen deals go down. We have seen communities built up in the wilderness and then the capital falls because the price of ore drops. These things happen, but what happened with Falconbridge and Inco stands alone in the history of Canadian mining because so many people warned and predicted that if we allowed the potential merger that could have taken place to be ripped apart by a corporate raider, the long-term impacts would be devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144566">The government at the time told us, “Do not worry. There is a nickel boom right now. Everything is fine”. It showed the fundamental misunderstanding that it has, that just because there is a boom in mining does not mean there is not going to be a bust. There will always be a bust and it is who controls the resources at the time of the bust that becomes a central issue. Right after the takeover by the hostile corporate raider, Xstrata, and then Vale took over Inco, we hit the bust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144567">We lost 1,000 jobs in Timmins. We lost all our copper refining capacity in the province of Ontario because of the government. I would like to ask my hon. colleague what it meant for the people of Sudbury, when they knew and were warning the government that this deal with Falconbridge and Inco being taken over was a disaster in the making. What did they think of the refusal and the glib answers that they received from the government?</ParaText>

The community was thrilled and excited. People were talking about it everywhere. We were going to create synergies in our community. We were going to take the big trucks off our main streets. These two large companies were going to work together to create a better community for all, and unfortunately, the government sat on its hands and that deal failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144569">What did we get? We got Xstrata coming in and taking over Falconbridge, talking about all the great things it was going to do for our community, and then it laid off 686 workers and shut down mines, but kept the high grade mines open because they pretty much cost zero dollars to operate. Vale on the other side, again, Inco and Falconbridge could have been creating all of these synergies but instead, there was a year-long strike that not only affected 3,000 families, but affected the mining supply and services sector which is 17,000 families in our community, which then affected our broader community overall. Our entire community was suffering. If only we could have gone back four years and gotten the government to stop sitting on its hands.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—the Government of Canada should take immediate steps to amend the Investment Canada Act to ensure the views of those most directly affected by any takeover are considered, and any decision on whether a takeover delivers a “net benefit” to Canada is transparent by: (a) making public hearings a mandatory part of foreign investment review; (b) ensuring those hearings are open to all directly affected and expert witnesses they choose to call on their behalf; (c) ensuring all conditions attached to approval of a takeover be made public and be accompanied by equally transparent commitments to monitoring corporate performance on those conditions and appropriate and enforceable penalties for failure to live up to those conditions; (d) clarifying that a goal of the Act is to encourage foreign investment that brings new capital, creates new jobs, transfers new technology to this country, increases Canadian-based research and development, contributes to sustainable economic development and improves the lives of Canadian workers and their communities, and not foreign investment motivated simply by a desire to gain control of a strategic Canadian resource; and that the House express its opposition to the takeover of Potash Corporation by BHP.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="2144576">As I have mentioned, under the Investment Canada Act, where an investment is subject to review under the act, the minister must approve an investor's application for review before an investor can implement an acquisition. The minister only approves applications where he is satisfied based on the plans, undertakings and other representations of the investor that the investment is likely to be a net benefit to Canada. The review process under the act is rigorous. It involves careful analysis and extensive consultations with government departments and the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144577"> Let me take a moment to explain the confidentiality provisions of the act. They do not permit the minister responsible to make comments about specific investments without the investor's prior agreement. Divulging confidential information outside of the narrow exceptions of the act is a criminal infraction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144578">Some members of the House have questioned why the confidentiality provisions of the act are so strict. The confidentiality provisions of the act reflect the fact that the information shared by the investor with the government is often commercially sensitive information, which, if disclosed, could harm the competitive position of the investor and harm its partners, including, for instance, its suppliers. Unless investors are sure that their information will be protected by the government, they will be reluctant to share information that is critical to the rigorous review process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144580">During the review process, the investor generally provides plans and undertakings to support that its new investments are likely to be a net benefit to Canada.

              <ParaText id="2144609">For weeks we have heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> rant and rave. We have heard the opposition use ever more inflammatory language, with a lack of understanding of both the process and common sense. Last night the Minister of Industry kept a cool head. He weighed the facts and made his decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144610">I want to say today that Canada is open for business. Canada's economy needs foreign investment. Interestingly, Canadian firms invest more money outside of Canada than foreign firms invest here. We live in a world in which Canada has strong economic fundamentals. I would argue that this is in part due to our economic action plan and to the great leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Our companies are better able to compete abroad. We cannot and we must not close the door to foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144611">Our government was elected on the platform of standing up for Canada, and we will fulfill that commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144612">Under 13 years of Liberal rule, the Liberals ignored the west. Yet in the past few weeks, the Member for Wascana seems to have forgotten that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144613">While we had one member from Saskatchewan promoting his own interests, we had thirteen members from Saskatchewan working with the government to promote the best interests of Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144614">As my colleague pointed out earlier, he cannot even get along with his own colleagues in the province. This is basically the rule of thumb for how things operate there for him: he is in disagreement with his own provincial Liberal leader about the position that he took.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144615"> I have also been surprised at some of the comments made about my own colleagues. They are made by people who, in many cases, do not even bother to call and talk to us. There are some people who think that unless there is division and dissension nothing is getting done. I can say that nothing is further from the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144616">There is another story that needs to be told. There are 13 MPs here who are able to work together, who are used to working together. We bring 13 different perspectives, 13 different histories, to the House. We bring 13 different opinions to our discussions. The folks whom I work with from the Saskatchewan caucus bring a team attitude. They set their individual egos aside for the betterment of our province. It is a group that can carry a unified message and is willing to present a unified front when we bring our ideas to caucus and to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144617">I am proud to be part of this group. I am proud to work with them. One of the reasons I am proud is that this approach has worked for Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan has benefited from this group of MPs. There has been consistent leadership in Parliament and in our party. Over the last few years, we have brought forward a balanced platform of tax cuts, a balanced stimulus package, a well-organized economic action plan, and a focus on strengthening our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144618">That is one of the things that has made our province a leader in the country. Others look to Saskatchewan for leadership. It is not an accident that this has happened since a Conservative government has come to power in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144619">The former Liberal government approved every single one of the applications for foreign takeovers. It never challenged any of them. Our government believes strongly in foreign investment, but a vital part of the deal is that it must be of benefit to Canada. We need take no lessons from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144620">Furthermore, we could see last night, if we were watching TV, that his leader has demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of how Investment Canada acts and how foreign investment works in this country. This is strange, because there has been a foreign takeover taking place in the Liberal Party for the last five years. We would think Liberals would know a little more about it than they seem to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144621">The government recognizes that, although foreign investment is generally to the benefit of the host country, there may be instances where a given transaction, according to the present legislation, upon close and diligent scrutiny, is determined not to be beneficial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144622">I would like to talk about the Investment Canada Act. To ensure that significant acquisitions of Canadian enterprises by foreign companies are of net benefit to Canada, the Investment Canada Act requires that the Minister of Industry examine and approve a proposed investment before it can be made. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144623">Under the present act, the minister must be satisfied, based on the plans, undertakings, and other representations of the investor, that the investment provides a net benefit to Canada. In making the determination, the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> must consider the following factors: the effect of the investment on the level and nature of economic activity in Canada; the degree and significance of participation by Canadians in the Canadian business or new Canadian business; the effect of the investment on productivity, industrial efficiency, technological development, product innovation, and product variety in Canada; the effect of the investment on competition within any industry or industries in Canada; the compatibility of the investment with national, industrial, economic, and cultural policies; and the contribution of the investment to Canada's ability to compete in world markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144624">This process and this act require that significant foreign investments are of net benefit to Canada. That is only half the story. I want to talk about the many associate benefits that Canada reaps when Canadian businesses make investment abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144625">Until the 1970s, certain branches of economics viewed outward foreign direct investment as generally detrimental, particularly with respect to economic growth in capital-exporting countries. Large enterprises investing outside their home countries were thought to be depriving the home country of economic growth and employment. Thankfully, we now know that this is an inadequate perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144626">Nowadays, Canadian investment abroad contributes to a more dynamic and competitive economy both in other countries and at home. To be more specific, I am going to go through a few points about our foreign investment. Data show that the growth, productivity, and profit from Canadian firms involved in global markets has been superior to the performance of domestically oriented firms. Income from Canada's foreign direct investment increased sharply with the increase of outward foreign investment. Direct investment income averaged $6 billion between 1990 and 1996, almost $2 billion more than between 1985 and 1989, and that directly helped to improve our standard of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144627">The growth of Canadian investment abroad leads to an increase in exports, and this directly affects Canada's economic health. Exports account for more than one-third of our gross domestic product. They are the path to future growth and continued competitiveness in the global marketplace. No one knows this more than the folks in my part of the world who grow agricultural products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144628">Investment abroad offers Canadian high tech companies better access to foreign skills and foreign technologies. It also increases research and development in Canada, which in turn leads to innovation, expanded market potential, and better employment opportunities for highly educated workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144629">The spillover effects benefit companies that are not necessarily investing abroad themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144630">We cannot shut the Canadian economy off from foreign investment, as the NDP and the coalition seem to want. The benefits are too great. We must be vigilant. We must make sure that the net benefit of a transaction is, in fact, a net benefit to Canadians. That does not mean building a 60-foot wall, as the coalition would like to see, as the current NDP leader in particular would have us believe is necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144631">As a small economy, we welcome foreign investment because it is an important economic driver. Foreign investment contributes to our economy and is absolutely critical. The trend toward globalization and foreign investment provides many benefits to Canada, and it is important to adopt policies that encourage trade and investment. That is what Canadians expect, and that is what our government will deliver.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144633">The member talked about what his government was elected on, what the mandate was. It is fundamental to politics that we campaign on something. People look at the campaigns, compare them, and elect us on that supposed mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144634">The Conservatives also talked a great deal about accountability and transparency in government. Part of the NDP motion today, which addresses not only potash but also foreign investment in general, is to ask that public hearings actually happen. We need to make public hearings a mandatory part of a foreign investment review. This would not require every moment of the foreign investment to be made public. But something should be put into the legislation that allows the public the opportunity to see the arguments made by the foreign company or foreign government looking to buy a Canadian asset. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144635">In the spirit of accountability to the Canadian people, and to the workers of a company that might be purchased, would my hon. colleague agree with that sentiment? Would he agree that at least some part of the review should be made public? Would he agree that the public should have an opportunity, in the fair and true light of day, to see exactly what is being done to a Canadian firm?</ParaText>

It does not have credibility on the issue of foreign investment. It certainly has no credibility on the issue of trade deals. It absolutely has no credibility in the province of Saskatchewan and what has happened there. It was been in power so long that it pretty much destroyed our economy.

              <ParaText id="2144642">Madam Speaker, the member opposite probably knows the law and knows the requirements of those law in this situation. I think he is well aware of that. However, I can again go over the kinds of things the Investment Canada Act requires the minister to consider in making his decision. I know these are the things that he considered, things like the effect of the investment on the level and nature of economic activity in our country, the degree and significance of participation by Canadians in that new business, the effect the investment would have on productivity, industrial efficiency, technological development, those kinds of things, the effect of investment on competition, the compatibility of the investment with national policies and the contribution of the investment to Canada's ability. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144645">I recently asked the parliamentary secretary if he was open to transparency and accountability. It is of good note for the public that he refused to even answer the question at all, whether he was supportive or not, or had any actual opinion on the idea of public hearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144646">The record shows that there have been 13,500 Canadian firms taken over in a brief amount of time, with only two of those bids being rejected. Out of 13,500 takeovers, the government, and the previous one, found only two that they did not see as a net benefit to Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144647">When we ask the government to define what net benefit actually means, other than just an anecdotal term, it offers nothing. It offers a “trust us” type slogan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144648">This process allows companies to meet behind closed doors and never involve the public in any moment of the deliberations, never involve the employees, the shareholders, the workers, or the communities that may be affected. This has left a path of destruction behind it. At a fundamental level, it is irresponsible government. It is laissez-faire as an ideology taken to a point of ultimate doom for communities that survive and depend on some of these companies. We know the list of communities and companies that have suffered because of this lack of oversight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144649">The government may smile, but it needs to talk to the former employees of Vale Inco, Stelco, or Falconbridge. It needs to talk to the 300 Alcan employees who lost their jobs in Quebec. All of these takeovers somehow passed the net benefit test of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144650">In some cases, the government has been forced to take the company to court to receive some sort of compensation back, but there is no due process in a court of law that will be compensatory to the families that have been uprooted, that have had their whole lives turned upside down because they have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Often the communities and employees have built the company up, often from scratch, to a world-leading status. These are strong companies as they are being sought after by other companies around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144651">I can recall an incident in the House when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> was asked about the potential purchase of Noranda by Minmetals, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chinese communist government. The finance minister had the gall to say that we could not stand in the way of foreign so-called investment. A solely owned communist government company was going to come in and buy our largest mining interest and the government had no problem with it whatsoever. It was as if the Chinese government would not use that as a leverage for its own national interest and against ours. This is beyond belief and the ability to imagine from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144652">I do not know if it is a lack of experience. I do not know if it is ideological blinkers that the Conservatives have placed on themselves. However, they have to wake up to the reality of the 13,500 consecutive takeovers and the experience in places like Thunder Bay, Sudbury, Timmins and Hamilton. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144653">The people of Saskatchewan woke up to the reality that this would not be a net benefit to them. There was not a chance. If BHP Billiton decided to move its head offices or shut down operations, as it talked about in a Chicago court but did not mention it to the government, then the people of Saskatchewan working for this company and affected it would have no recourse whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144654">It was only after much political pressure, when the people of Saskatchewan stood and said “No more. On this one, fight for us please” to the 12 or 13 hon. members who come from the Conservative caucus out of Saskatchewan, did the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> find himself caught between a rock and a hard place. The rock was the will and determination of the people of Saskatchewan. The hard place was his ideology that the market solves all in all cases, full stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144655"> We know for a fact that foreign investment is not always the same thing and can have multiple results. It is uncertain. There is foreign investment that creates jobs. In the NDP motion talks to foreign investment that creates opportunities for our economy. We are a trading nation and the New Democrats recognize that. We recognize that foreign capital can enable companies to do more, to go out and seek opportunities that they otherwise could not get at. However, foreign capital that takes away jobs, shuts down head offices and puts people out of work is not what I would determine good foreign investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144656">We have this process in place, this act in which all of these takeovers are governed by, but it protects nobody except the narrow interests of the investors of those taking over the company, and these companies are truly global in scale.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144657">BHP Billiton is based in Australia, but the investors are all over. They do not care a whit for the people of Saskatchewan or Canada. It is about the bottom line. In the current markets in which they exist. It is not about the next five or twenty-five years of profitability. Often these CEOs and their executive boards are attached to the next quarter's results, because their pay and compensation is linked to the next quarter, the next three months, not the next thirty years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144658">The reason Potash was so successful, started by an NDP government, was because it had a long-term view. It was able to make strong investments. It was able to look to the long-term view and understand that potash would be a strong resource for many years to come. That was created from a left-leaning government to enable the economy of Saskatchewan to stay strong for many years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144659">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128596" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation> will talk about the real life examples. The government can talk about this in cold, harsh economic terms or just get up on its hind legs and attack the parties and all this nonsense. However, in real people terms, the effects of some of these takeovers have been a net loss to Canada, and it has to admit that in the cold light of day. They have been a net loss to the people of Sudbury. The people of Timmins, or Hamilton, or Kitimat, B.C. are feeling no net benefit. There has been a net loss and the government just has to recognize that the act needs to be improved, and the NDP is calling for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144660">In our motion, the first request we make of the government is to make the hearings public. What sitting member can turn to the people of Saskatchewan and tell them they are not allowed in the door to hear what is going to happen to one of their most significant economic drivers, that they should trust the member and that the power is going to reside in the hands of one person, the minister, as if the minister has this divine inspiration to make the right call and understand all the facets? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144661"> I guess the government is saying that people are just too dumb to understand, that they do not have the right to access these hearings. What a bunch of malarkey for a formerly grassroots movement, which was the Reform Party, to come to this place with such arrogance. I use the word carefully but significantly. To say that the Canada Investment Act needs no public disclosure whatsoever, that the good people of Saskatchewan, or Sudbury or Kitimat have no right or capacity to possibly understand what is being discussed is arrogant. It is arrogant to suggest that only the minister can have any influence over this decision and that is the way it has to remain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144662">There was a Saskatchewan member quoted just a couple of days ago. When asked what was going to happen with this, his response was “read the Conference Board of Canada report”. The Conference Board of Canada did a study on this and told the government that it should just sell it off. So much for members from Saskatchewan standing up for their constituents. They were actually advocating publicly that the Potash Corporation should be sold off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144663"> The Premier of Saskatchewan had to go on television and radio, decry that statement and say that the member of Parliament from Saskatchewan did not know what he was talking about, that the Conference Board may have said that but it was not such a great idea for the people of Saskatchewan. I have the Conference Board report right here, if any of the members from the Conservatives would like to actually read it to see what they were supporting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144664">It seems to me that in the business environment, and we hear this from particularly the larger companies, a level of certainty is required to do business in Canada. The OECD, which looks at developed markets around the world, cited market uncertainty as the number one reason not to invest in Canada. It did not say labour costs. It did not say environmental protections. It did not say any of these things. It said that to invest in the Canadian market, the number one detriment, and the Conservatives have to get hold of this, was uncertainty, poor regulations in the stock market and a poor understanding of the rules surrounding foreign investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144665">That is not me talking. That is the OECD, not exactly a left-leaning organization. It is saying this because it has surveyed the business community, the international investment community and the capital managers. The OECD found, in 2007, 2008 and again in 2009, the number one detriment to investing in this country was uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144666">The NDP is calling for more certainty today. It is saying that when companies step forward, looking to truly invest in Canada, in the true sense of the word invest, to enable communities to become stronger, to put more jobs into our marketplace, to put food on the table, because that is what investment should do, they must have clear and accountable guidelines. It should not be in the hands of one minister, not behind closed doors where deals are being made and the people are told to stand outside and wait patiently for the inspirational powers of intelligence of the current minister or whomever the minister may be. That is wrong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144671">That is my view of this particular case and cases to come, because there are going to be more and we recognize that: “ensuring all conditions attached to approval”. So if a company has committed to keeping its headquarters in Saskatchewan, it should be made public, signed on the dotted line, so the constituents have something to hold up in a court of law to say the company broke its promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144672">We know that, in case after case, companies acquiring Canadian firms make all sorts of promises. They are in a public relations mode. They are going to promise the sun, the moon and the stars, but when it comes to reality, six, 12 or 18 months down the road, they are not so committed and the government has taken some of those companies to court. Obviously the Investment Canada Act is not working and it would not have worked in the case of Potash. The government was right to refuse the sale. It was right to do this because it could not get this into the public light. Ultimately, it is the public that deserves to know these things.</ParaText>

Imagine, as my hon. colleague has said, a Canadian firm attempting to do what BHP Billiton was trying to do to Potash. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144679">Would the foreign investment rules of the Brazilians, Chinese, Germans, and the list would go on, allow a Canadian firm to do the exact same thing with so few commitments and none of it in the light of day? The clear and obvious answer is, not on their life. They understand that, although this does not apply to all industries, there are key industries and sectors in our economy that are truly the foundations. If we take them out, the whole economy is weakened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144680">We are argue that the economy of Saskatchewan, and in effect, Canada, would be weakened by this takeover. I know the government is feeling conflicted about this decision. We can hear it in members' comments. They do not like what they just did, because it banged right up against an ideology that the market solves all. Laissez-faire was always the answer. We know that our competitors, the Chinese and the Brazilians, have a free and open access market as well, but they put conditions on things that will always service their own interests. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144681">For goodness' sake, if the Conservatives campaigned on standing up for Canada, they should do it from time to time. They should truly stand up for Canada and our net interests. Is that not what any government should promise itself and the Canadian people: to leave the country better than they found it?

              <ParaText id="2144686">We might say they are waking up on the wrong side of the bed, for the government's decision on BHP is largely a response to buy time and try to minimize political damage in Saskatchewan. I want to take this moment to thank Saskatchewan NDP provincial leader Lingenfelter for all the hard work that he and his caucus has done on raising this issue and pushing it to the forefront as well. We know that we could not rely on the 13 MPs in Saskatchewan. Normally we would call that a baker's dozen, but that is far from a baker's dozen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144687">People are getting angry in Canada. We have not been getting a fair shake when it comes to the trend of more and more foreign ownership of what we consider to be ours. In northern Ontario we have seen this all too clearly.

              <ParaText id="2144691">Canadians have nothing to gain from silly slogans and political manoeuvres that serve to avoid debate. We all want a prosperous economy.

              <ParaText id="2144692">What we tend to disagree on most of the time is the solution. For some time now, the NDP has been denouncing the fact that foreigners can have free access to our markets without providing appropriate guarantees. Frankly, that limits our options.</ParaText>

It was like that for years, but not for the kid who gets hired on next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144697">It is like that all across Canada. So many communities are hurting. Budgets are tight and they are getting tighter. All kinds of costs are going up at the same time. We are in an economic squeeze play and it is getting harder for Canadians to accept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144698">In terms of excessive CEO salaries and bonuses, let me just talk for a minute about those. Let us look at the January report of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. It says that Canadians have been hit hard by a worldwide economic recession, but not Canada's 100 highest paid CEOs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144699"> It goes on to show how the total average compensation for Canada's 100 highest paid CEOs was $7,300,884 in 2008. Compare that to the total average Canadian income of $42,305. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144700">By a little after 1 p.m. on the first working day of the year, these CEOs had pocketed what takes Canadians earning an average income an entire year to make.</ParaText>

That is something that will not sit well with the people of Hornepayne, who are struggling as that community lost the Northstar Centre, thanks in part to CN and the way the Liberals privatized it with no regard to the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144702">It looks as though my colleague who used to sit in this House, Bill Blaikie, was right when he fought so hard against a deal that made no sense to the real stakeholders, the people of Canada.</ParaText>

For people struggling to make a living in places such as Wharncliffe, Webbwood, Smooth Rock Falls, Moonbeam, Iron Bridge, Dean Lake, South Baymouth, Manitouwadge or White River, this is a little hard to swallow. That is what I meant as I spoke about excessive CEO salaries and bonuses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2144735">Madam Speaker, clearly that pricked a little bit of a nerve over there, and I can imagine why. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144736">I can absolutely imagine why, because when those people campaigned, they certainly did not campaign on the promise to stay silent. They certainly did not promise to stay quiet when the best interests of Saskatchewan and the best interests of Canada were at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144737">This was a situation where people of Saskatchewan, including the premier of Saskatchewan, were overwhelmingly saying that this would be a problem, and 13 Conservative members of Parliament from Saskatchewan were only able to sit on their hands. This is not criticism of them personally; it is a criticism of the atmosphere in the government that simply does not allow dissent, does not allow any other kind of debate, and I am very concerned about the fact that we have 13 members of Parliament who simply were unable to speak on behalf of their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144738">I will go on to another question. When the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> yesterday made his announcement, he said something I found rather extraordinary. He said the department, which he heads, made no recommendation. I might be not quite right, but if I remember correctly, the words were “the department made no recommendation”. This is the Investment Canada Act. This is the Ministry of Industry. This is part of its job and there are some extraordinarily talented, hard-working people in that department. For the last number of weeks there has been a great number of people focused on this. This is one of the biggest issues in Canada today, if not the biggest issue facing Canada right now in terms of what the ministry and what the department had to decide on. How is it possible, after all that time and guaranteed a significant amount of work by some very capable people, that the department made no recommendation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144739">I would suggest that is another example of the need by the government to control its message, to make sure there was no message before the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a decision. Let us not kid ourselves. This was very much from the Prime Minister's Office. This was not the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>'s decision on his own. But to deny the fact and to say that the entire department did not make a recommendation, I find extraordinarily hard to believe. It is another example of the deterioration of the entire governance process in this country that the people who we have working in government, supposedly on a non-partisan basis, to give advice to the government on an acquisition this significant for Saskatchewan, and for Canada as a whole, that those capable people apparently made no recommendation. We have to seriously question the role of the Prime Minister's Office and the minister in taking upon themselves alone the entire decision-making process in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144740">I would also like to ask a question about net benefit. This does speak to the motion. I am not in agreement with all parts of the motion that is being proposed, but I do support significant portions of it that do call for greater transparency. We do not know what the government thinks net benefit means. In that regard, I would like to stress that I, as a representative of the Liberal Party, support foreign investment. We very strongly support foreign investment. Indeed, as other members of the House mentioned, we have had a great number of acquisitions in the last couple of decades, whichever government was in power, whether it be Liberal or Conservative. This will only be the second refusal, the first one having been based on national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144741">There have been a number of other acquisitions that did not proceed, not because there was an open door without any restrictions, but because the process that we had undertaken had established certain examples of what would be required. So in those discussions the members of the department were able to suggest to the proposed acquirers that they were not going to meet the net benefit test and therefore the acquisitions did not proceed. So it is a mistake to say that no acquisition was ever refused. However I would say that within that context, the ones that were approved were an indication of just how open we are to foreign investment. That is a very important process. It is a very important thing for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2144742">However, we do have to determine the parameters and the criteria associated with net benefit. We do have to make this clear not only for ourselves, not only for the departmental workers who work so hard to help these processes along, but we also need to clarify the criteria of net benefit specifically in order to encourage foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144743">A potential acquirer, no matter where it might be in the world, will look at Canada, and this one is an even more egregious example because it is such a big acquisition and we have had no description of what net benefit is, none. A potential acquirer somewhere else in the world could look at Canada and say it is a wonderful place to invest. It has a wonderfully educated population. It has great winters. In all seriousness, it has a tremendous investment climate. However, a potential acquirer would have to wonder what would be the decision at the end. If the potential acquirer does not know what the criteria are, for example, if it does not know that it needs to maintain a head office in Canada, if it does not know for sure that it will need to maintain a certain number of jobs, if it does not know that there are going to be certain other requirements, it will be that much more loath and less inclined to even start the process for a potential acquisition in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2144744">We, as Liberals, are very concerned about the need to establish much more detailed definitions of what net benefit means. That would in fact encourage foreign investment because right now we have a government decision that negates all the efforts of the department, that does not clarify what net benefit means and thus creates more confusion than there was to begin with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145045">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to resume my comments on the motion on the Investment Canada Act, in particular the current issue under discussion about the recently declined offer by BHP Billiton and the takeover of Potash. It is not completely a no. We are well aware of the fact that there are 30 more days for further developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145046">I am pleased to rise again after my initial remarks and I will take the opportunity to repeat a couple of things, although I will do so in French.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2145047">What we need is a strategic vision and a great deal more leadership for Canadian resources. We know that Potash Corporation represents resources that are extremely important, not only for Saskatchewan, but also for the entire country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145048">Yesterday evening the government, the minister and probably the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a decision, and we all thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, who is a special member, one of the 14 members from Saskatchewan, but the only one who worked very hard for the people of Saskatchewan and indeed for all Canadians. He is the one who demonstrated that foreign ownership of Potash Corporation would turn out to be a very bad decision because of the strategic importance of the company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145049">The 13 Conservative members from Saskatchewan had nothing to say. Nothing at all. In the midst of all these discussions and knowing the clear views of the majority of citizens in Saskatchewan, the majority of Canadians, the Premier of Saskatchewan, the Premier of Alberta, the Premier of Manitoba and so many others, the 13 Conservative members from Saskatchewan said nothing, and sat back and did nothing. But that is not necessarily their fault. What is really disappointing for us is that it is clear that the Prime Minister's Office controls everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145050">Some members cannot even speak and cannot even act in the best interest of their constituents, the people of Saskatchewan and the people of this country. That is really unfortunate. Our country has a very serious problem right now if certain members of Parliament cannot speak and cannot defend the interests of the people who elected them. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2145051">It is a little awkward having a speech that gets broken up by question period and significant events. Therefore, I will reiterate a couple of concerns that I raised at the beginning of my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145052">There is value in foreign investment in Canada but it is important to have a clear delineation of what net benefit means in this country. We in the Liberal Party are very supportive of foreign investment. People have said a number of times over the last couple of decades that there have only been two, this being the second, proposed foreign investments that have been refused. The first one was based on security issues. During the Liberal government and the Conservative government before that none had been refused. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145053">In past Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments, the Liberals have indicated sincere and enthusiastic support for foreign investment. What we are now seeing is the complete lack of transparency and understanding in this process of what on earth net benefit means. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145054">We have a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has completely flip-flopped in the space of two weeks in terms of what his own personal preference might have been. We have a minister who said in his announcement that the department made no recommendation. How on earth could the department not make a recommendation when it has so many people who are talented and hard-working? How the minister could say that there was no recommendation is beyond comprehension. It really speaks to the control of this kind of decision-making within the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145055">The larger concern is that it completely muddies any understanding of what net benefit is in this country. Of all of the proposed acquisitions that we have dealt with over the last couple of decades, there have been a number that did not go through. They did not have to go through the formal process and did not have to be denied but there was enough involvement by members of the department and back and forth discussion with potential buyers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145056">In a number of cases acquisitions did not go through because that was clarified and made clear to the potential acquirers before they wasted their time and money going through the entire process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145057">We have seen now that this complete lack of clarity has allowed a company like BHP Billiton to go this far, only to be denied. Had we had a much clearer definition of net benefit to Canada, it would make foreign investment more likely. This is the point I very much want to stress. For those of us who are very strong supporters of increased foreign investment, this potash arrangement should not be seen as anything other than an issue related to a very distinct, strategic resource. This is not to be taken as an indication of Canada's overall enthusiasm in welcoming foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145058">What we do need is for potential foreign investors to know what the rules are before they waste time and money proposing acquisitions and investments in Canada. Although I do not support all of the aspects of today's motion, I do support a significantly greater level of transparency. Not only do we support the provision of a significantly greater level of detail in terms of what net benefit actually means, but we call on the government to provide it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145059">In that regard I want to mention the incredible work by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> who has worked tirelessly in support of the best interests of Saskatchewan. I also want to mention the noticeable silence on the part of 13 Conservative members of Parliament from Saskatchewan. I have a real concern about the level of control by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the silencing of members of Parliament. On the commercial side, I want to stress that we do encourage foreign investment, but we are turning it away by being unclear in what we require in terms of net benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145060">I welcome any questions and look forward to having continued discussion with my colleagues.</ParaText>

I thought she was going to refer to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128379" Type="2">Saskatoon—Humboldt</Affiliation> or one of the other good members of our Conservative caucus as she built up to that. However, the member for Wascana should know the need for there not to be even the appearance of imprudence. I think it was before her time, but she might recall a scenario involving the member for Wascana who was blamed for losing the 2006 election for the Liberals. There were allegations that the member for Wascana's office was not discreet enough in respect to a decision on income trusts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145064">Mr. Speaker, I am not rendered speechless very often, but I am somewhat taken aback by the fact that one of the members from Saskatchewan has finally spoken and has had the nerve to refer to an incident that was in fact proved to be completely wrong. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> was shown to have the utmost integrity and had nothing to do with any of the allegations. With all respect, the member opposite should be very, very careful about raising allegations that have been proved to be untrue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145065">I will also address the concern there might be in the process of the Investment Canada Act. The member opposite is absolutely right, in that I happen to have some significant familiarity with the legalities of Investment Canada rules. He knows very well there are not the restrictions he is pretending to hide behind. He also knows very well that of all of the people who do have an obligation during that period, members of the cabinet and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have the largest of those responsibilities. For the Prime Minister to stand in the House and suggest erroneously two things, that Potash Corporation was an American controlled company which is absolutely false, and that in his view an Australian company taking over an American company did not matter to him, one, is completely false and two, showed an immense amount of bias that was completely improper on behalf of the Prime Minister. It has sullied the process.</ParaText>

They may not all have to be there at the same time. In some cases, being able to accomplish one may prevent a business from accomplishing all of the others. It is in the nature of international businesses and the nature of foreign investment.</ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> certainly is not short of bluster or rhetoric, but during the 13 long, Liberal years, I do not recall the member not approving any application for a foreign takeover.

              <ParaText id="2145075">The other one is that when the process was undertaken, unlike apparently this one where the minister himself suggested last night that the department was not involved because the department did not come up with the recommendation, in all of those others cases, I can assure the hon. member that the department was very much involved in all of the discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145076"> In fact, there were a lot more potential acquisitions which in those discussions did not proceed, because the acquirers were not led down the garden path to believe that they might actually succeed, and did not spend all sorts of time and money in order to get there, only to be told no at the last minute. At least in the process undertaken under a Liberal government, some of those acquisitions did not happen because of very good and extensive, substantive discussions prior to engaging in the process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145088">Over the last 25 years, since Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney declared that Canada was open for business, thousands of companies have changed hands and tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145090">Since the inception of the Investment Canada Act in 1985, there has been 17,485 foreign investments under review. According to Industry Canada of those 13,516 have been takeovers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145091">Under the ICA, the Conservative government has turned down only one takeover prior to this one, and that was MacDonald Dettwiler. This happened after considerable pressure led by an NDP MP, Peggy Nash from Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145092">During the 13 year term of successive Liberal governments, not one single takeover was blocked. In 2009, again according to Industry Canada, the government reviewed only 22 of 338 takeovers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145093">The United States accounts for over 60% of all takeovers in Canada since 1985 and continues to account for about half today, well ahead of the EU, which is at 27%. In 2007 foreign controlled firms accounted for 21.3% of Canadian corporate assets, 29.4% of total revenues and 26.2% of operating profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145094">For the first time since 1999, in the year 2000, foreign-controlled companies operating in Canada held more than half, or 52.8%, of manufacturing assets, up from 46.8% in the previous year. Statistics Canada says that the increases are due largely to foreign acquisitions of Canadian controlled, especially in primary metals, wood and paper industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145095">Today, as we talk about a net benefit to Canada, do we mean a net benefit for Canadian workers or Canadian investors and corporate boards? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145096">Last evening on the CBC national news, the network compared two takeovers in Hamilton: Dofasco by ArcelorMittal and Stelco by U.S. Steel. Clearly these are two players in the manufacture of steel products that function with very different business models.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145097">I remember well the enthusiasm in Hamilton when U.S. Steel came into the chase to purchase Stelco, the new-found hope that pensioners had that their pensions would be secure by promises made by U.S. Steel. The workers in the plant felt, at least tentatively, that could begin to plan their futures for them and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145098">Today as collective bargaining has stalled and many employees at the Hamilton plant wonder how it could even have been called collectively bargaining at all. Demands from the company are clearly designed to destroy their defined benefit pension plan and take away the ability of new employees to count on a dignified retirement in the future. That is the single major issue in this dispute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145099">The former Stelco, now U.S. Steelworkers, clearly remember the situation their brothers and sisters at U.S. Steel's Nanticoke plant faced, with many months on a picket line trying to defend their pensions. Hamilton workers now have to question what lies ahead for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145100">United Steelworkers Local 1005 have labelled the situation at U.S. Steel as nation wrecking. It has done so because it has seen what happened to labour relations after Vale's purchase of Inco, when Xstrata laid off hundreds of workers and Rio Tinto closed operations in Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145101">These companies came to Canada making promises to workers and their families, making promises to the federal government that they would maintain operations and employment. Our federal government said that the propositions put forward by these companies would be a net benefit for Canada. At these plants, workers are still waiting for this supposed net benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145102">Older workers at all of these plants and at U.S. Steel in Hamilton wonder just how bad it can get. Are we actually in a race to the bottom?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145103">Today U.S. steelworkers face what in collective bargaining is commonly called whipsawing. Normally, whipsawing happens when one plant in Canada that has a relationship with a company is played off against another unit in the same company during their collective bargaining process. However, the difference here today in the whipsawing of these workers at U.S. Steel is that they are being whipsawed against plants in the United States under the ownership of the same American employer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145104">Is it not simply logical to expect that an American company would protect its own citizens ahead of Canadian workers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145105"> In Hamilton's situation, U.S. Steel has closed down the last operating blast furnace and has indicated that it will lock out its employees shortly unless workers accept a decimation of their defined benefit pension plan. Where is the net benefit for these Hamilton workers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145106">How is Canada a better country because we allowed Xstrata, Rio Tinto, Vale and U.S. Steel to bring their anti-worker labour relations to Canada? I would suggest nation wrecking does apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145107">Today workers are not being asked to give up their own defined benefit pension plan. They are being asked to give up the possibility for future generations to retire with security. These Hamilton workers are being coerced into committing a major disservice to their own families future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145108">Canada has built on value-added manufacturing that turned our resources into the products needed around the world. Canadians must ask themselves how we have reached this point, where corporate demands that before had been considered out of the question are now quickly becoming the norm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145109"> How is it possible that we are now faced with importing corporate control of not only our companies but potentially foreign corporate control of our resources? The reason is clear. This has happened as a result of successive governments in this place making terrible decisions in allowing foreign investment deals and company takeovers that clearly have failed to meet the test of net benefit to Canadian workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145110">If members hear my voice tremble slightly today, it is because I am angry and I am hurting. I agree with United Steelworkers Local 1005 that nation wrecking is being allowed to take place across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145111">I will close with a few of questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145112">What will the government do to reverse this devastating calamity for Canadian workers?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145113">Will the government take into account the status of existing collective agreements reached between workers and companies over many years and apply an aspect of net benefit to Canada to this part of any foreign ownership deal?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145114">What limits is the government prepared to put on the ability of foreign corporations to roll back collective agreements using whipsawing between Canadian and non-Canadian companies?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145115">When we talk net benefit to Canadians, we must include net benefit to the plant workers at the same time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145120">Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, it is very clear that there are two different business models at work between these two companies in Canada. When I talked about Vale, Xstrata, U.S. Steel, labour relations and the management style that has been brought into Canada, that management style very clearly has been to at least minimize collective bargaining, if not destroy it, and to force workers into a position where they lose the defined benefit pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145121">For those who may or may not know, a defined benefit pension means that on the day people retire, they know they will get a certain percentage of their pensions. If the market is down, the company has to make it up. On the other hand, with a defined contribution, on the day people retire, if that market is down, they will get only what the market will dictate. That is a major loss for Canadian workers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145122">Mr. Speaker, it is good to see the Conservatives' new-found interest in reviewing takeovers.

              <ParaText id="2145123">The issue is the fact that when Bill <Document DbId="3636372" Type="3">C-10</Document>, the omnibus budget bill from last year, passed with the help of the Liberals, there was a measure raising the general review threshold to $1 billion over a four year period.

Canadians do not trust the current government, and they did not trust the government before, on these deals because they do not see what the deal is.

              <ParaText id="2145130">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this important motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145131">For the record, the importance of this motion lies in its five key elements: one, making public hearings a mandatory part of foreign investment review; two, ensuring those hearings are open to all directly affected; three, ensuring all conditions attached to the approval of a takeover be made public; four, clarifying that a goal of the act is to encourage foreign investment that brings new capital, creates new jobs, transfers new technology to this country, increases Canadian-based research and development, contributes to sustainable economic development and improves the lives of Canadian workers and their communities; and five, asking that the House express its opposition to the takeover of Potash Corporation by BHP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145132">As a northern Ontarian, I experienced first-hand the impact of a bad foreign takeover where jobs have been eliminated while profits soared, pensions and nickel bonuses were under attack, and replacement workers were hired, contributing to the longest strike in our region's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145133">My community is living proof of the current and previous governments' failures to protect the interests of Canadian workers and their communities. I worked at Inco for 34 years. Those workers became my extended family. To watch them suffer because a foreign company was intent on driving down their wages, taking away defined benefit pensions and reducing their bonuses while raking in billions in profit cannot in any way be defined as a net benefit to our community or to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145134">The nickel they are taking out of our mines is Canada's natural resources and my community's resources. Northern Ontarians will never forgive the Conservative government for approving the sale of such strategically important mines, Inco and Falconbridge, to foreign companies without extracting guarantees that there will be measurable net benefits to our region and country or holding them accountable when they broke their contractual obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145135">It is the reason New Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the need to strengthen the Investment Canada Act. We heard my colleague from Windsor West earlier today point out that he warned the government years ago. We heard about the efforts of former NDP MP Peggy Nash, who worked diligently to help stop the sale of MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145136">Since being elected in 2008 and appointed mining critic by my leader, I have worked with my community, concerned workers and other stakeholders to push for changes to the Investment Canada Act. I would remind the House that on April 28 of this year, Parliament passed my motion that called for lowering the threshold for public review of foreign takeovers, ensuring public hearings are held in affected communities, and requiring publication of the reasons for decisions and conditions to be met by approved foreign owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145137">Today we build on that motion by articulating what constitutes a net benefit to Canada. Canadians are not naive. They understand the difference between foreign investment and foreign takeovers. There is not a single Canadian who does not get the importance of global trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145138"> However, Canadians also understand that certain sectors of our economy, particularly parts of our natural resources and telecommunication sectors, have strategic importance, and in some circumstances “open for business” cannot mean allowing a fire sale of our successful companies and strategic resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145139">New Democrats understand that difference. Canadians understand that difference. One can only hope that the Conservative government has begun to understand that difference as well, but I will not hold my breath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145140">To be clear, there are positive examples of good foreign investment. Essar Steel Algoma Inc. in my colleague's riding of Sault Ste. Marie is one such example. There are others as well, all across the country.</ParaText>

One only has to look at the government's disgraceful behaviour during the Vale Inco strike in my community.

              <ParaText id="2145173">Mr. Speaker, it will be a pleasure to speak to the NDP opposition day motion, which seeks to make amendments to the Investment Canada Act. I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128336" Type="2">Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145174">I should say at the outset that I believe all legislation from time to time needs to be reviewed. I believe that there should be reviews on a regular basis of all legislation to see whether or not current legislation can in some way be improved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145175">While there are some elements of the motion before us today that I agree with, there are others that I do not accept. I agree with the spirit of the motion, which states that we should be reviewing the Investment Canada Act to see whether there are ways to improve the current provisions of the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145176">I would point out that, since we first came to power in 2006, our government has made changes to the Investment Canada Act. We included provisions that required us to consider national security when determining whether foreign takeover bids should be approved. We did this a couple of years ago, when there was a proposed takeover of the MacDonald Dettwiler organization, which was heavily involved with robotic arms and other technologies for the aeronautics and aerospace industries. At that time, we turned down a bid from a U.S.-based company, because we felt that, in the interest of national security, it was best to keep that company in Canadian hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145177">Beyond the motion itself, I want to speak to a political dynamic that I think has seized the House and the country over the course of the last couple of days. Most important, I want to talk about the role that the Saskatchewan members of Parliament have played in the deliberation process during the last few weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145178">More specifically, I want to talk about the role we have played in helping the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to decide whether or not to accept the BHP bid in the proposed takeover of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145179">The 13 Saskatchewan members of Parliament have been fully engaged on this issue for several months. We had meetings with the Premier of Saskatchewan. We had meetings with many ministers of the Crown in the province of Saskatchewan. Even more important, we met with our constituents, the people of Saskatchewan, to get their feelings about this proposed takeover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145180">Opposition members, in a self-important exercise, have gathered themselves before the nearest camera or reporter to tell the world of their efforts to influence the government. I can assure all members of the House, however, that their attempts to influence the government in its decision-making have been futile. They have had no effect whatsoever. I would also point out that actions speak louder than words. Opposition members, particularly the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, have tried to convince the public that they were leading the charge on the rejection of the BHP bid. But in fact, the opposite is true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145181">They had no influence. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> had absolutely no influence on the government decision, nor did the leader of the NDP. But day after day in this House we heard them asking, “Why will the 13 members of Parliament from Saskatchewan not stand up and oppose this deal?” The answer is quite simple. If the members had taken the time to review the Investment Canada Act, they would find under “disclosure” that members on the government side were prohibited from expressing opinions or commenting on the merits of the proposed takeover bid. In fact, members of Parliament, departmental members, and cabinet ministers can be criminally charged if they do not follow this part of the law. We observed these legal prohibitions, but we worked diligently behind the scenes with the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, expressing our opinions and the views of our constituents on the proposed BHP takeover.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145182">Opposition parties attempted to get publicity, feather their own nests, and convince their constituents that they were working on their behalf. But it was political pandering and nothing more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145183">Our members of Parliament, by contrast, worked hard and long to express the wishes of the people of Saskatchewan, talking to constituents, consulting with members of the provincial government, and speaking with ministers of the Crown. Let me say once again that opposition members had no influence on the government. Opinions on the government side count. The opinions of the opposition members, in contrast, have no impact whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145184">I hear a lot of caterwaul, bombast, and bluster from members opposite. This is only another attempt to get their message heard through the media, to convince Canadians that they are actually relevant. On this issue, however, they are not relevant at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145185">I want to congratulate all of my colleagues from Saskatchewan, because I know how hard they worked on this file. We were under intense pressure from the media and members of the opposition, who stated incorrectly that we were invisible, that we were not standing up for our province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145186">I know different. Every one of the 13 members of Parliament from Saskatchewan also knows different. We know the effort that we put in to speak with the minister and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to gather information to assist the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> in making his final decision. Our efforts were entirely successful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145187">For the next 30 days, we will be prohibited from making extensive comments on the decision. However, after that 30-day period, the minister and all members of Parliament from Saskatchewan will be more than pleased to explain to all Canadians what went into the decision and what we did to bring it about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145188">We will not ignore or oppose legal prohibitions, now or in the future. We will comply with all legal provisions contained in legislation in the House. Members opposite, of course, being in opposition, do not have to observe these legal prohibitions. They can comment, scream, yell, and whine, but they have no influence. They have absolutely no influence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145189">In this case, which was one of the most controversial foreign takeover bids of the last 20 or 30 years, the opposition members had nothing to offer the debate. Knowing that government members were prohibited from speaking publicly, they tried to make a political case to further their own interests. It was nothing but partisanship, pure and simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145190">On the other hand, the deliberations of the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> were in great part shaped by the information he received from Canadians, business people, the bidder, the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, and members of the Saskatchewan caucus. I will not stand and say that our efforts alone caused the Minister of Industry to come up with his decision, but I will state emphatically that the members from Saskatchewan played an integral part in the minister's decision process. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145207">Canada has had a longstanding debate, and some would call it a perennial debate given the length of time it has been ongoing, over the benefits and costs of both inward and outward foreign direct investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145208"> Fears about foreign investment in Canada are rooted in protectionist thinking from bygone days. This type of thinking does not reflect the new realities of globalization, whether it is in relation to trade or investment flows. In a word, these fears are outmoded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145209">The idea that foreign-controlled companies operating in Canada will turn our economy into a branch-plant economy is simply not based on fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145210">Open markets and globalization have disaggregated production processes to the point that supply chains are now global. Our challenge is to ensure that Canadian businesses can maintain and enhance their positions within these global supply chains, so that they can be cost-effective and successfully compete against competitors from other countries. In order to be successful in today's globalized economy, Canada must attract more inward foreign investment and Canadian businesses must continue to invest abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145211">The concern for Canada is not too much inward foreign direct investment in Canada or too much outward Canadian investment abroad. Rather, the real concern is to ensure that Canada is not falling behind other countries with respect to attracting foreign direct investment. Canada has to maintain and improve its share of investments to secure associated benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145212">In today's globalized economy, investment is linked to trade, and we all know that our economy is heavily dependent on trade for our prosperity and standard of living. We cannot be complacent and rely on outmoded policies, which impose undue cost on Canadian businesses and Canadians. We simply cannot afford this. We must ensure that Canada remains an attractive destination for foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145213">In fact, based on data from the World Investment Report 2010, over the period 2003 to 2009, Canada was the world's seventh-largest recipient of the global foreign direct investment flows, attracting more foreign investment than Germany and Italy among the G7 countries; Canada attracted some 3% of global inward foreign direct investment flows, well above its share of global GDP of 2.3%; and Canada also ranked second only to the United Kingdom among G7 countries in terms of foreign direct investment flows per capita.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145214">Access to foreign markets is essential for a small economy such as Canada's. We are working aggressively to open markets in foreign countries for Canadian goods, services and investment through trade negotiations and free trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145215">I would now like to speak briefly about foreign direct investment in Canada and some of the benefits that are associated with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145216">Until as recently as the late 1970s, many countries were highly suspicious of foreign investment, particularly from large multinational enterprises. Indeed, many countries limited foreign investment or banned it entirely in key sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145217"> Canada was also cautious of foreign direct investment. In fact, in 1973, Canada created the Foreign Investment Review Agency to screen inward direct investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145218">However, in today's global economy, countries have taken a completely different and new tack, as is the case for Canada. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145219">Countries now seek, and in fact compete, to attract foreign investment as they recognize its many benefits. This is why it is important for Canada to maintain its open policies and continue to welcome foreign investment. Foreign direct investment contributes positively to Canada's economy and is critical to our long-term growth and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145220">Let me be more specific about some of the benefits of foreign direct investments in Canada. First, foreign direct investment is a key source of jobs, especially those that are highly skilled and pay high wages. Studies have shown that 1 in 10 jobs in Canada can be attributed to foreign investment. Moreover, foreign-controlled firms in Canada pay higher wages than their Canadian-controlled counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145221">Second, foreign investors make strong contributions to the Canadian economy, including the much-needed capital for our Canadian economy to grow. While the majority of capital is sourced domestically, a growing proportion comes from international sources. Foreign investment provides much-needed additional capital that would otherwise not be available. Canada is competing with other countries to attract foreign investment, and we are successful at it in light of our fair, predictable and stable business environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145222">Third, foreign investors provide access to new goods and services and exposure to different management styles and processes. Foreign investors often do bring innovative marketing strategies and new perspectives on management, people and technology. This expertise is often passed on to Canadian firms. This ultimately enhances the ability of Canada's business to compete and raise the overall level of productivity of the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145223">Fourth, foreign investment is also an important source to access new technologies. Considering the high costs of research and development, Canada must recognize the role foreign investment plays to ensure that Canadian firms continue to have access to leading-edge technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145224">Finally, foreign investment contributes to Canada's success in international trade. Foreign firms often produce goods and services not just for their domestic market but for their international affiliates. Research has shown that foreign firms operating in Canada are more export-oriented. In 2002, foreign-controlled establishments operating in Canada accounted for only 9% of the total number of exporters but contributed almost half of Canada's exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145225">I am thankful for this opportunity to address my colleagues in the House and to articulate the importance of foreign investment in our economy.</ParaText>

While members of the opposition were busy trying to politicize this process, the members from Saskatchewan were honouring the process and the requirements of the act. We held several meetings, as was mentioned already, with the minister and with members of the Saskatchewan legislative assembly, and we met as caucus. We listened to the people of Saskatchewan and, indeed, all Canadians to ensure that they were and are effectively represented.</ParaText>

It is massively profitable. That is a direct example of foreign direct investment into his own riding. That is the largest employer in his riding, with high-paying, high-quality jobs in the tech sector. That is foreign direct investment hiring Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145274">There are examples, certainly with regard to natural resources in different regions of the country that have different pressures and different dynamics, and members opposite are more than welcome to raise those concerns.

              <ParaText id="2145275">What I wanted to clarify is the member's attack, frankly, on the members of Parliament from Saskatchewan. There are 14 members of Parliament elected from the province of Saskatchewan and 13 of the 14 are Conservatives. It is different when one is on the governing side of the House of Commons. I can say that the members of Parliament who are over here, including you, Mr. Speaker, and I see the member from Saskatoon and others, work incredibly hard, and just because they do not turn red and yell it into a television camera does not mean that they are not working very hard for the people of Saskatchewan. I can say that they are.</ParaText>

The government failed to protect the workers of Inco and Falconbridge where the U.S. courts tied up the chance for us to have a great mining Canadian champion.

Vale Inco just asked for $1.2 billion loan when it has people on strike. I bet the government will be ready to give it to the company.

We were in the overwhelming majority of companies, that category where there was just a rubber stamp and was allowed to go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145286">When we look at what the legislation is ultimately supposed to be about, it is about a net benefit to Canada. Last time I checked the map Hamilton was a part of Canada. Therefore, there ought to be a net benefit in the home town of where the plant is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145287">As of today, we are on the brink of U.S. Steel locking out its employees, the ones who are left after they shut down product and laid off a whole whack of other workers. If it gets what it wants in their negotiation demands, the steelworkers who are currently retired will lose their inflation protection going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145288">That may not seem like an awful lot when we are talking about 1% or 2% inflation, but a lot of us believe, with everything that has gone on in the last few years, there is likely somewhere in the lifetime of those steelworkers going to be a period of inflation. At the end of that, their income is going to be a lot less and their quality of life is going to be a lot less and their net benefit to being a Canadian is going to be less than it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145289">Not only that, the company wants to change the collective agreement further so that every employee hired from here on in does not get the same pension benefit as the workers who came even the day before them.

A primary production site does not shut down regularly and have its production shifted to plants in the United States. Call the Hamilton plant a backup location, an overflow operation, whatever. The plant in our city is nowhere near the top of the steel giant’s list of important places....But Canadian government approval of the purchase was contingent on commitments from U.S. Steel on maintaining certain employment and production levels.</QuotePara>

There ought to be some public acknowledgement, some public involvement. Perhaps there ought to be some public negotiations.

              <ParaText id="2145312">One of the more interesting things we have had take place during this debate, and I agree with my colleague's assessment, is that if it were not for the good people of Saskatchewan and Canadians from across this country pushing the potash issue, there is no way the government would have turned away from this actual deal. This is one of the reasons I think the minister is now using the language of “interim” decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145315">One of the other interesting things is that the minister has been bragging that he is taking U.S. Steel to court. When we back this up, it is rather odd. U.S. Steel comes in and the minister sits down with U.S. Steel and decides that this will be a good business partner for them, sets out the terms and conditions for their partner, and their partner basically backhands them at the expense of Canadian families and workers, and he is bragging about how he is taking U.S. Steel to court.</ParaText>

They have paid into their pension. They have paid to the United Way and have done all their good diligence over the years as good, hard workers to be productive, and because the company uses us as a branch plant and shuts down operations to feed its Americans, just because the government is taking the company to court, they should be grateful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145323">Mr. Speaker, it will be difficult to cut a 20-minute speech down to 6 or 7 minutes, but I believe it is important for me to address the House, even if I only have a few minutes left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145324">We all know that PotashCorp owns 20% of the world's potash reserves. Potash is a rare mineral used to make fertilizer. We all saw what happened in mid-August when there was a hostile takeover bid and an outcry against it because BHP Billiton was offering $28.5 billion, or $130 per share. The day after the bid, the President and CEO of PotashCorp, Bill Doyle, more or less called the deal an attempt to steal the company. However, he also quickly stated that he was not saying that the company is opposed to the sale, but that it is opposed to “a steal” of the company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145325">We can see what is happening. Shareholders and owners of a very important company are not bothered by the fact that they are permitting a Canadian company to be taken over by foreign interests, but more so by the fact that they will have less money in their pockets. With the 30-day deadline, the government has the opportunity to jump up and purchase the company for less than it is worth. We must consider that the share price was $250 two years ago, before the recession. There may be hope yet for Billiton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145326">Today, shares are trading at around $145, which is more than the $130 per share offered by Billiton. Furthermore, this will obviously depress share prices, probably for a number of years. From a financial standpoint, Saskatchewan is afraid that it will lose up to $3 billion per year if PotashCorp is sold to foreign interests. In response, BHP offered to compensate Saskatchewan with a $370 million payment into a future infrastructure fund, which the provincial government rejected as being completely inadequate to offset the loss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145327">Even the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> indicated that he was not uncomfortable with a foreign takeover of PotashCorp. The government is rather dogged in its determination. Earlier, I mentioned a 30-day period. This will allow the government to quickly rebound.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145328">The NDP motion is very clear. It would amend the act “to ensure the views of those most directly affected by any takeover are considered, and any decision on whether a takeover delivers a 'net benefit' to Canada is transparent”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145329">The first part of the motion would make “public hearings a mandatory part of foreign investment review”. I should point out that the second paragraph of section 4 of the Investment Canada Act already enables the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to consult with industry and labour stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145330">However, such consultations are voluntary, not mandatory. Also, there is nothing to state that these consultations must be public. The Conservative government loves voluntary elements. That is what it is doing with the census.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145331">In exercising his or her powers, the minister may, if the situation calls for it—again, this is not an obligation, but the motion would make it obligatory—hold consultations by organizing conferences and meetings. With this government, everything is “may”, “maybe” or “possibly”, but this motion would make these things mandatory.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145332">The Bloc Québécois does not believe that the government's approach to investment in Canada is the best possible approach. When discussing the Investment Canada Act, we have to keep in mind the 2009 Budget Implementation Act, which allows the government to issue an order raising the minimum threshold for automatic review of a foreign investment in Canada set out in the Investment Canada Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145333">That threshold could gradually increase from the current $300 million to $600 million in one year, $800 million for the following two years and $1 billion for the years after that. Some very important players in Canada's and Quebec's economies, such as Nortel and aluminum producer Alcan, which is now just a subsidiary of giant Rio Tinto, have already been transferred into foreign hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145334">Foreign investors benefit from a favourable conflict resolution system internationally. A $1 billion threshold could result in many leading lights of the Quebec economy passing into foreign hands without the government ever having the opportunity to assess whether such takeovers are good for local economies. As such, the Bloc Québécois demands that these provisions be scrapped and that the threshold for review be set at $300 million.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145343">I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128450" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> for seconding this bill. I am grateful to my colleagues in the House who recognize the merit of this minor yet important addition to the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145344">I was inspired to table this bill following a horrible crime that took place in my constituency. The offender was charged, tried, convicted and sentenced. The case is no longer in the court. But I have had discussions with the victim of this crime and I would like to talk about what I have learned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145345">Flashing lights and a police uniform were used as weapons to abduct a 16 year old girl. She had just earned her driver's licence and was driving alone, as many of us do. She was held captive for 46 hours and brutally assaulted before she managed to escape from her attacker. She was brave. She survived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145346">It is a fact that she was abducted because she was led to believe that she had been pulled over by a police officer. When citizens see a police uniform, they naturally trust the authority that comes with it. Personating a police officer is a serious breach of the public's trust, and it has the same effect as using a weapon. It forces the victim to submit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145347">This crime involved personating a police officer, but I recognize that there are other occupations besides police officers that serve to keep the peace in our great country and they are all covered by the Criminal Code's definition of a peace officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145348">As I describe the specific points of this bill, let me start by explaining the definition of peace officer in the Criminal Code. They are positions that demand a significant amount of trust from the Canadian public. Anyone who falsely represents these occupations to commit a crime against a person is committing a serious breach of that person's trust and that of all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145349">The Criminal Code defines peace officers as Canadian officers of customs and excise, immigration, corrections, fisheries and the Canadian Forces. It includes pilots in command of an aircraft, mayors, wardens, reeves, sheriffs, justices of the peace and, of course, police officers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145350">When I began researching this issue I found that what had happened in Penhold and Red Deer was not a rare crime. This is happening in small towns and large cities all over Canada. Criminals are using authentic police lights and dressing in police uniforms in crimes such as auto theft and fraud in Kelowna; highway robbery in Oakville, Barrie and Brampton; assault and robbery in Ottawa; abductions in Scarborough and Calgary; break and enter and subsequent assaults in Sydney Mines and Oshawa; intimidation in Mississauga; unlawful confinement in Lethbridge; and fraud in King's County, Brantford and Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145351">This bill has a basic objective. It would make personating a peace officer in the commission of another offence an aggravating circumstance to be considered for sentencing purposes. It would add one clause to the Criminal Code following section 130. Because it is short, I would like to read my bill into the record:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145354">That is all. It does not seek to affect any interpretation of the crime. My bill would simply direct a sentencing court to consider this as one factor when dealing with someone convicted of personating a peace officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145355">In carrying out the objectives of sentencing, which are in section 718 of the Criminal Code, a judge can take into account aggravating circumstances, which tend to increase the length of a sentence, or mitigating circumstances, which tend to shorten the length of a sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145356">There are aggravating circumstances that are defined in section 718 that apply to all offences and there are also special cases of aggravating circumstances that apply to specific offences within the code. But to clarify, this bill seeks to be a special aggravating circumstance for a sentencing court to consider for the crime of personating a peace officer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145357">The decision of what sentence is appropriate always rests with the court, but it is our role as legislators to maintain the Criminal Code and establish sentencing provisions. I note that this offence used to be punishable as a summary conviction and had a maximum penalty of only six months' imprisonment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145358">This Parliament passed into law former Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document>, which increased the maximum penalty for this offence to five years' imprisonment and made it a hybrid offence. I commend the Department of Justice for its work on increasing the maximum sentence for this crime, which came into force on January 8 of this year. I applaud all of my colleagues in the House who voted in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document> and brought this change into law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145359">On behalf of the people Red Deer, I was proud to vote for Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document>. I am also proud to support all of the government's tough on crime initiatives. Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document> successfully tackled the problem of identity theft and fortunately, it also significantly addressed the problem of lax sentencing for personating peace officers. This was absolutely justified, as predators are deliberately posing as peace officers to lure their victims. I believe that with this increased maximum sentence, we must now also recognize that this crime can have varying degrees of harm as well, and should be penalized accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145360">A number of factors come into play in a sentencing decision, such as the criminal record of the offender or the severity of harm caused to a victim. Aggravating circumstances are just one more factor that sentencing judges are required to consider that tend to, but are not guaranteed to, increase the severity of the sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145361">When we look at aggravating circumstances that are in section 718 of the Criminal Code, one of them is evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim. This would apply in situations where an offender has an existing relationship with the victim, such as a teacher or a coach, or indeed a bona fide peace officer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145362">However, those who personate peace officers do not fall into this category. I have many esteemed colleagues in the House who are legal experts. I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that offenders who personate peace officers have not abused a position of authority, for they do not have that position to begin with. This circumstance in section 718 cannot be used, since this would apply to real police officers who would abuse their position of trust. It does not apply to those who are posing as police officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145363">If I may reiterate, an offender's false representation of himself or herself as a peace officer is intended to deceive and breach trust and authority, but this deceit is not captured by the existing circumstances that speak to these abuses. I hope that my colleagues in the House will recognize this gap in the law and work with me to fill it as my bill seeks to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145364">The House is graced with some former police officers who bring valuable experience to our debate on justice issues and many other issues. I have had discussions with these hon. members about my bill, and I appreciate their support, for they have the unique perspective of having served as police officers. They are very busy people, but they have taken the time to read my bill and offer their support, and I thank them for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145365">Police officers are often victims themselves. They serve us all with great courage. They keep us safe from those who would do harm and rarely see justice for crimes that are committed against them personally. We know that the Crown sometimes drops charges of assault against police officers to obtain guilty pleas. As victims who have not been vindicated by the courts would surely confirm, it must be an agonizing outcome for someone to personally deal with, no matter who the person is. I want to recognize and honour all peace officers in Canada. They are all affected by the crime that we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145366">People who have been hurt by someone posing as a police officer understandably would become fearful and have difficulty trusting real police officers. This is very unfortunate, as it affects these victims every single time they encounter a real police officer. It also affects police who are trying to do their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145367">There was a case in Calgary where a man personated a police officer and used flashing lights to attempt to pull people over to abduct young females. CBC News quoted a sergeant with the Calgary Police Force who stated that the false representation of a police officer was “a very serious offence”. He went on to say, “We cannot have our confidence in the public eroded. It is very important that we are able to conduct our jobs, and if people do not trust the police or they are worried, it can make our jobs very difficult”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145368">As that police officer stated, this is a serious crime that has far-reaching consequences, which is further proof that the government did the right thing by significantly increasing the maximum penalty for this crime as former Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document> did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145369">Police will often remind the public how we can recognize if someone is actually posing as an officer. As police have said, they always carry photo ID and badges. People should never be opening their doors or get our of their cars without seeing photo ID and a badge. An officer will show these when requested. If Canadians are in doubt as to whether or not someone is actually a police officer, they are advised to call 911.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145370">For 34 years I worked with children and young adults. As their teacher I shared their joys of accomplishment as well as their concerns about the future. I was always there to help them through difficult times when they had to deal with terrible ordeals, being a receptive ear to their voices gave me an understanding of how difficult and fragile life can be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145371">As a member of Parliament I have once again heard such a voice. I shared the same concerns as others in our community when I heard of the disappearance of a young girl from Penhold. Prayers were all that I could offer. No one knew why her car would be left where it was. There was nothing to indicate that she would have strayed from the errand that she was on, nothing. Her parents were frantic and our community of central Alberta empathized while we all waited. Finally the news broke. She had been found. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145372">Only then did the pieces of this horrible ordeal start to make sense. The weapons used by her attacker were flashing lights and an RCMP uniform. That is why the car was left where it was. Her trust of the uniform and the false sense of safety and authority that it presented to her resulted in the most horrendous 46 hours that anyone could imagine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145373">The subsequent trial of her abductor forced the girl and her family to relive this ordeal. Finally a verdict and a sentence was rendered, but two things haunted them: first, the knowledge that the crime of personating a peace officer amounted to only six months' imprisonment, which was the maximum sentence allowed before the passage of Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document>; and second, that in the commission of this crime the weapons used to lure her into a trap would not be recognized for what they really were. She had been deceived of the trust she had in the police and the weapon of deceit was considered as more of a side issue than being the catalyst for the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145374">Personating a police officer to force someone to do something in the hands of a criminal is just as effective as pointing a firearm. It is no less aggravating than breaking and entering with the knowledge that a residence is occupied nor many of the other situations that fall into the category of aggravating circumstances. It is no different to a victim than having been abused by a real, existing position of authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145375">Crimes involving firearms and break and entering with intent to encounter a resident necessitates special circumstances in the courts. They are rationalized as aggravating circumstances to ensure that they are treated as seriously as they should be. This is what my bill is designed to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145376">As it now reads in section 130 the crime is in the deception of the public about a person's status as a peace officer. It does not differentiate whether or not it was for a specific purpose of facilitating another crime or whether or not another crime is actually attempted or committed. In cases where the deception is intended to and in fact does facilitate the commission of another more serious crime, this is an extremely serious instance of the offence of personating a peace officer and therefore deserves an appropriately high sentence. This bill would give the sentencing courts the tools they need to apply appropriate sentences in these cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145377">The day that this brave young lady and her mother came to me for help was the day I knew that my receptive ear that was necessary as a teacher would also be part of my job as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145378">I appreciate the help that has been provided to me by representatives in the justice department, the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and the rest of my caucus. I would also like to acknowledge the great work of the talented researchers in the Library of Parliament. I also appreciate the support and understanding that I have received from my colleagues in other parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145379"> It is my hope that all of my colleagues can recognize the importance of this bill and will see that it is worth supporting.</ParaText>

Usually, in my limited experience with criminal law, a judge will look at the most serious offence and will say, “We need to remove this person from the community because he or she committed a very serious offence.” In this case, I believe it was 16 or 18 years, indicating that the judge thought it was a very serious offence and removed that person from the public subject to statutory release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145405">He also accepted that the accused was guilty of personating an officer, which at that time carried a sentence of six months. Did the judge make them run concurrently, the 6 months and the 18 years, or did he take the 18 years, 17.5 years, and add the 6 months?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145406">My experience tells me, looking at the case briefly, that the sentences would run concurrently, not consecutively. In other words, the fact that there was a guilty finding on the personation aspect of the case did not lengthen the sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145407">The amendment to the code, which says there should be aggravating circumstances considered in the section 130 offence of personating an officer, could lengthen the sentence in these situations. But if the judge still makes the two sentences run concurrently, even if there were two years given for personating in the same situation, and 18 overall for the violent sexual assault, there would still be an 18-year sentence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145408">This is one of the questions we have to ask at committee. We have to do our due diligence in support of this bill to make sure that it is delivering the goods to the good people involved, the victims. That would be one of our first questions at committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145409"> The motivation for this was due to the victim's bewilderment, perhaps the general public's bewilderment, in regard to the case. The thing that started it was the personation, and that got only six months. There is something wrong with that, because it was such an egregious offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145410">The amendment came in 2009, and we now know that the maximum is five years. If we were pretending to be judges, would we give the personation aspect of this crime five years, with 18 years for the aggravated sexual assault, which lasted for some 46 hours? It is difficult to know whether these sentences would be different under this law. I think the drafter of the bill intends that they would be. In these circumstances, the uniform and the cruiser lights should be an aggravating factor in the section 130 offence of personating an officer. Without the personation, the sexual assault would not have happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145411"> I understand the motivation for the bill. But we have to remember that a police officer and a prosecutor can lay an indictable charge for this offence, and that a judge can impose a sentence of up to five years for personating a police officer. We have to think of all the situations that do not lead to egregious offences. Someone who personates a police officer with no resulting crime is very unlikely to get a five-year sentence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145412">Clearly, the drafters on the government side increased these maximum sentences to five years. It was a government bill. They had the idea that these offences alone could be very serious, but that the important thing was to deter the commission of further offences. Why else would someone personate a police officer? There are many cases, other than George Leahy on <I>Trailer Park Boys</I>, in which some clearly unstable people personate police officers. But some people personate them without any ulterior intent of doing serious harm. In this case, it was used to do very bad things to Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145413">In cases where someone is not going to use the personation to do something further, there would not likely be as harsh a sentence. However, I believe the government was thinking that, if personation was coupled with another offence, the judge, the prosecutor, and the police ought to have the discretion to make this a very serious offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145414">There are reported cases in our communities of people personating police officers to get entrance into offices, homes, and private businesses. They are personating police officers to gain the trust of young people. They are personating police officers to steal money from charitable organizations. All these things are happening and they are serious offences. There are gradations, however. And though they are not as serious as the Penhold case, I think Parliament was thinking that the five-year sentence would be imposed when the personation led to a serious offence. We need to make sure at committee that this is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145415">Bill <Document DbId="4664986" Type="4">C-576</Document> simply says that the judge “shall consider this as an aggravating factor”. It is not permissive. It is not “may”. It is something the committee might want to look at. In the end, we have to have faith in our judicial system and in the judges who apply it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145416">In conclusion, I commend the member for drawing the attention of the House to section 718. Every justice bill that comes through the House should be in the lens of section 718, which sets out the principles of sentencing. These are based on denunciation, the removal of a convicted person from the community, rehabilitation, deterrence, and restitution. Without this balance, none of these laws make sense. I commend my friend for bringing such a thoughtful bill to the House, and we will certainly send it on to the committee.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="128465" Type="2">Mr. Serge Ménard (Marc-Aurèle-Fortin, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2145417">Mr. Speaker, I have to say that when I saw this bill my first reaction was to think it was useless. I cannot imagine that anyone uses a police uniform or other articles for anything other than committing a criminal offence. It is true that people are somewhat fascinated by police uniforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145418">In fact, I remember seeing someone walking around the Montreal courthouse in a uniform that he had probably had made for him, and it really looked like a police uniform. He had a marshal's baton and was always impeccable. He really enjoyed talking to people. He had a straight-back demeanour. Everyone figured he was a little crazy but not dangerous. No one ever thought of accusing him of impersonating a police officer. His uniform did not really look that much like a police officer's. His baton looked more like a marshal's baton or one that belonged to a commander of a military establishment on parade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145419">It seemed clear to me that if someone was dressing up as a police officer, they must have dishonest intentions. And that is already covered in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145420">I have to say that I am impressed with the research that has been done by the member who introduced this bill. I think that, as he said, his proposal fills a gap in the Criminal Code. As a consequence, we will support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145421">I am not as impressed with some of the reasons he gives for supporting it. I even started questioning whether or not we should support it when he said that the bill is important because we need to be tough on crime. That is the answer to everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145422">When will the government understand that being tough on crime and lax on arms gives results like those in the United States? The incarceration rate in the United States used to be comparable to Canada's, but in one generation it has become seven times higher than Canada's. What has that achieved? Why are their homicide rates three times that of Canada and five times that of Quebec?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145423">It seems to me that this combination of tough on crime and lax on arms should convince everyone who knows that they are going in the wrong direction. We must not be tough on crime; we must be smart on crime. And smart on crime can mean giving harsh sentences when they are warranted, but it can also mean giving restorative sentences, sentences that promote rehabilitation, when they are warranted. In general, the public tends to support harsh sentences in theory, but in practice, it tends to favour rehabilitation, especially when they learn that children they know have ended up involved in a crime. They would like judges to take that into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145424">We are balanced in Canada. Our incarceration rate is fairly comparable to rates in western Europe. England has a slightly higher rate than we do, as does Scotland, but generally, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands all have lower incarceration rates than Canada. Our crime rates are generally comparable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145425">However, the free country, I will say, that has the highest rate of violent crime is the same country that has the harshest sentences. Also, people seem to forget that it also has the remarkable distinction of having beat out Russia. No one ever would have thought that the United States would incarcerate more people than Russia. But it has. Today, the United States is at about 730 prisoners for every 100,000 inhabitants, while Russia is at about 680.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145426">It is even said that half of all inmates in the world are found in American prisons. Frankly, are people any safer in the U.S. than they are here? Some people will say it depends on the neighbourhood. If there are some safe neighbourhoods in the U.S., then, considering the crime rate in that country, that means that others are extremely dangerous. Why do people in the United States feel the need to carry a weapon to protect themselves? That does not give the impression of a safe society, even though it has the highest incarceration rate in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145427">I would love to see the member forget about his tough on crime principles. I prefer his patient, precise and intelligent work. He discovered a weakness in the Criminal Code and then exposed it and documented it. He has convinced us that his work was far from useless. That is why we will support him. He deserves our congratulations and our thanks for this work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145437">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128378" Type="2">Red Deer</Affiliation> ably outlined the terrible circumstances that led him to propose his private member's bill. It stemmed from an incident that took place in his riding in 2009, where a 16-year-old girl was abducted and sexually assaulted by an individual who posed as a police officer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145438">The individual pleaded guilty to several charges and was given an 18-year sentence for kidnapping. He was also sentenced to six months for personating a police officer but, and this is the piece that is troubling for people, that sentence would run concurrent to his other sentence. Many in the community felt that it should have been made consecutive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145439">There is one thing each and every one of us takes to heart. As a mother, when my son was young, I used to tell him that if he ever was separated from me, he should go to a police officer. We talked about what a police officer looked like and I showed him pictures. What becomes really important is this element of trust. It is fundamental to our justice system that we look to our police officers to protect us and to be safe people so we can tell young people to go to them when they need help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145440">The kinds of incidents that we are seeing are, sadly, not isolated incidents, and I will talk about a couple of others. If they were isolated incidents, we could take care of it. What we are doing is undermining the trust people have in our police forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145441">The other element of this, before I talk about some specific cases, is this is a really important opportunity to educate people. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128378" Type="2">Red Deer</Affiliation> rightly pointed out, every police officer has certain protocols and procedures that he or she undertakes when stopping people, such as showing identification, having a badge and a number of other things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145442">It is an important aspect of the debate in the House to remind people that they also have rights when they are being stopped by who they believe is a police officer. They should always be comfortable in taking the step of contacting their local station or calling 911 to verify that the person they are interacting with is actually an officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145443">I want to touch on a couple of other instances. One example was in the Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> in October. A man was stopped by a woman and the woman who pulled him over was not dressed in an officer's uniform, but her demeanour and questions led him to believe she was a police officer. The fake officer demanded that the man pay the speeding fine on the spot. He did not have enough money with him and subsequently went to an ATM to withdraw cash. It is also a good reminder that people personating police officers are not just men. They are also women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145444">In Kelowna in May, police were trying to find out who was responsible for stealing a car by impersonating a police officer and trying to defraud the car owner. The women called to report the theft and also reported that a so-called police officer on the phone had asked for her bank card and personal identification number so he could secure her bank cards. The real police officer who responded to the theft report knew that questioning about bank information was not what police would ask in an investigation and told the woman to cancel her bank cards immediately. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145445">That is a really important reminder. As the article in the <I>Kelowna Capital News</I> reports, the fact is no authentic police officer will ask someone to hand over cold, hard cash on the spot, nor will he or she ask for bank card information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145446">There is the case in Mississauga where a Mississauga councillor candidate is charged with impersonating a police officer and trying to intimidate a rival candidate to abandon her campaign. Sometimes we have public figures who are, sadly, misusing their position to do something like intimidation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145447">There was another case in Alberta where a man impersonated a Mountie and used his phoney authority to terrorize two university students. He has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail. Around 4 a.m., he entered a 7-Eleven store, identified himself to the clerk as a police officer and asked to use the phone. The clerk became suspicious and immediately contacted the Lethbridge Regional Police. Here we have an example where somebody who was suspicious about whether or not this person was a valid police officer. The clerk took the steps, and we need to encourage people to do this, and contacted the Lethbridge Police Department to ensure that the store was dealing with somebody who had the authority to be there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145448">The <I> Globe and Mail</I> talked about an officer is defrauding students. I know many of us have probably seen these emails that go around, asking people to send money because somebody is in trouble. In this case, the police were warning the public to be on the lookout for a man who was pretending to be a Chinese police officer and was defrauding Chinese students. The police allege the man contacted his victims and then, under the guise of conducting a security check or investigation, asked for personal banking information, such as a PIN numbers or security codes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145449">There are a lot more of these circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145450">Others have pointed out that some questions need to be raised at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145451"> The NDP will be supporting the bill going to committee. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> has talked to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128378" Type="2">Red Deer</Affiliation> and has told him we support sending it to committee. However, the member for Windsor—Tecumseh said that he had some concerns that the present wording would not likely achieve the desired outcome, particularly as most judges would already consider personating a police officer as an aggravating circumstance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145452">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> is proposing amending the bill to require the judges to provide a rationale if they did not make a section 130 offence consecutive to any other offence. The reason he has proposed this is it would make the action explicit. When judges made the sentencing, they would explicitly state that they had considered the aggravating circumstances and that there was a rationale for making the sentence concurrent rather than consecutive. Also, he wants to maintain the confidence the public has in the justice system, that there is some credibility. It should be explicitly stated that the judge has considered the aggravating circumstances when making the sentence and it would be part of the decision being rendered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145453">I acknowledge the good work the member for <Affiliation DbId="128378" Type="2">Red Deer</Affiliation> has done on this matter. It is an important matter to raise in the House. When it goes to committee, I am sure there will be opportunities for witnesses to come and talk about the impact on their lives and their families. We will also hear from other members of the House about how the bill can be improved to ensure it has the intended effect, which I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="128378" Type="2">Red Deer</Affiliation> is interested in achieving. We will be supporting the bill.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2145454">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in support of Bill <Document DbId="4664986" Type="4">C-576</Document>, which deals with the offence of personating a peace officer. The offence essentially criminalizes the act of pretending to be a peace officer or public officer when one in fact does not hold such an office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145455">This offence, located at section 130 of the Criminal Code, was a straight summary conviction offence until recently. Summary conviction offences carry a maximum of six months in prison and a maximum fine of $5,000 or both. Our government hybridized these offences in former Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (identity theft and related misconduct)</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145456">Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document> made a number of important changes to the Criminal Code. In particular it enacted a new offence called identity theft, which prohibits the obtaining or processing of another person's identity information with the intent to use that information in the commission of another criminal offence. It also changed the name of the existing offence of personation to identity fraud. Personation is an offence for pretending to be another person with the intent to gain advantage or cause a disadvantage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145457">Identity theft is usually followed by identity fraud. First one obtains another person's identity information. This is identity theft. Then it can be manipulated into false documents or combined with other information to create a false identity, and finally, the information is used to deceive someone about the identity of the person in front of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145458">Identity crime is flourishing, as we all know, and these criminal law amendments are a crucial element in the struggle to keep Canadians' identities and their property safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145459">In addition to these important amendments, Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document> also hybridized the offence of personating a peace officer or public officer. As of January 8 of this year, personating a peace officer is no longer a straight summary conviction offence. It is now a hybrid offence. When prosecuted on indictment, this offence is now punishable by up to five years in prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145460">It is interesting to note that in many countries like Canada, peace officer personation is still considered a relatively minor offence. In a number of U.S. and Australian states, as well as the United Kingdom, peace officer personation is punishable by a maximum of a few months or a year or two. Only in a few jurisdictions does the maximum penalty rise to five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145461">This new sentencing regime for police personation in Canada is therefore above average for similar jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145462">As of the passing of Bill <Document DbId="3791389" Type="3">S-4</Document>, this offence is no longer treated as a minor offence. It is now a serious offence, which protects the integrity of important government institutions and offices and guards against the many harmful consequences that could flow when a citizen is misled about whether a person has the authority to act in an official capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145463">For instance, a motorist who has just witnessed an accident might report the accident to someone he or she believed was a peace officer but who in fact was not. The good Samaritan might genuinely believe he or she had fulfilled a civic duty by reporting the incident to law enforcement and might believe that the matter would be acted upon and any injured persons would be provided with adequate care. But the impostor likely intends to move on without taking any action to assist those involved in the accident. This kind of situation poorly serves everyone involved. The importance of public trust in the police can never be underestimated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145464">Fortunately, charges for personating a peace officer are relatively rare in Canada, but I must admit they are increasing in numbers and severity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145465">But still there are concerns about this kind of crime, as Bill <Document DbId="4664986" Type="4">C-576</Document> reminds us. Sometimes people impersonate the police for the simple thrill of feeling powerful or for other relatively minor objectives, such as obtaining information.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145466">But other times, as we have heard here tonight, police personation is closely associated with other offences. In these cases, a criminal will pretend to be a police officer in the hopes that this deception will make it easier to commit other crimes. Most members of the public will acquiesce to the authority of someone they believe to be a police officer. The personation of police in these cases is an attempt to exploit a person's trust and confidence in law enforcement. These kinds of situation are the most troubling and are especially deserving of condemnation by sentencing courts as well as this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145467">This is precisely what Bill <Document DbId="4664986" Type="4">C-576</Document> does by making it a mandatory aggravating factor on sentencing for the crime of personating a peace officer if the offence was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another offence. Bill <Document DbId="4664986" Type="4">C-576</Document> draws attention to this rare but devastating practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145468">It is true that sentencing judges already have the discretion to consider any and all aggravating factors that might be applicable in any given case. The codification of aggravating sentencing factors does not really allow the courts to do anything they are not already empowered to do. Each factor that is mentioned in the Criminal Code adds to the complexity and size of it, so this is not a form of legislation we should endorse as a matter of routine practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145469">Bill <Document DbId="4664986" Type="4">C-576</Document> is worthy of support because it speaks to a horrific kind of criminality, which has so many negative consequences. Using someone's trust in the police as a weapon against them is extremely disturbing to us all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145470"> There are the direct consequences suffered by a victim of such a deception, whether it is the theft of their property, an invasion of their home or a violation of their sexual or bodily integrity. The victim may also suffer a host of indirect harms, such as loss of trust in the police. Society at large suffers a reduction in its ability to trust public institutions if this crime becomes more common.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145471">It is premature to say that this crime is increasing in frequency, but there have been a number of incidents reported in the papers in the last few years. There was a case involving drivers being stopped by a police impersonator and requested to pay immediately for an alleged speeding offence. We heard that just recently. Another case involved motorists who were followed after leaving a casino and then pulled over and robbed of their winnings. There have also been profoundly disturbing cases involving police personation in order to get someone into a car to kidnap them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145472">The case in the sponsoring member's riding of Red Deer was a devastating case involving the abduction and sexual assault of a teenaged girl. The perpetrator in that case was apprehended, pleaded guilty to a number of offences and is currently serving an 18-year sentence. There are occasionally other stories of sexual assaults that have been facilitated by police personation, and I am aware of several myself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145473">All Canadians should be concerned about these cases. However, we do not want Canadians to become suspicious of all police officers. This will make the work of law enforcement even more difficult. Nor do we want Canadians to be at an elevated risk of being victimized by blindly trusting the mere assertion of authority. It is a difficult balance to achieve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145474">The exercise of a little caution is a good thing. An attentive citizen who is approached by someone representing himself or herself as a police officer should look for suspicious behaviour, such as unusual requests by the officer or unusual actions. It is reasonable and acceptable to ask questions of police officers or to ask to see their badge or warrant card specifically and closely verify that the uniform they are wearing bears the name of the locality one is in, rather than just being a generic-looking uniform. People should look for specifics.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2145475">This kind of verification process should always be done respectfully and cautiously, but in general, Canadians should not be afraid to seek confirmation that the person who claims to have a certain authority actually does have that authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145476">Raising awareness in Canadians of this tremendous and horrific crime of personating a police officer and then using that to commit a crime should be supported by everyone in the House, and I certainly do, as does my friend's Conservative caucus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145478">When I first read the bill, I thought initially that if it was that important it should be a government-sponsored bill, but the more I think about it, the more I think that the member's taking this on is actually the proper approach to take. We heard the member from the Bloc indicate that he too was suspicious of it in the beginning, but the more he thought about it, the more he recognized that the member has had an excellent idea, something that he can support, so perhaps the member will have success where his entire government is having no success at all on its crime bills that it rains down upon the House on a daily basis. This member's bill may be the one bill that actually gets through the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145479">I had indicated in my question that initially I really thought this kind of thing only happened in the cases of John Dillinger and the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, but we have all heard stories about Mexican police. We have heard stories about police in Peru. In other parts of the world on a constant basis people personate police in an effort to take advantage of others, steal money from them and do much harm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145480">It should not really be a big surprise that it is an increasing activity. As the previous member pointed out, not all of the cases we have uncovered actually involve physical harm to individuals. We have had several cases where people have been pulled over by the fake police, who have attempted to collect speeding fines from the people. Obviously they have been doing this on a continuous basis and using it to raise money. </ParaText>

It is a chain that anchors them to lives that cannot possibly realize their fullest potential. It is a woeful destroyer of youthful dreams and once hopeful ambitions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145490">Recently, on April 29, 2010, the Senate of Canada unanimously approved its report on poverty, <I>In From the Margins: A Call to Action on Poverty, Housing and Homelessness</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145491">This report confirmed yet again what we all know. Poverty is a real and growing problem here in Canada, one of the world's most prosperous nations. The report went on to make recommendations on how to address poverty and homelessness across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145492">I implore the government to reconsider its decision to reject the recommendations made in the Senate report and to take action on the meaningful and wise suggestions put forward in the study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145493">We know that statistics can at times seem to be mere numbers on a page, but they also tell a story that cries out for a voice. In my home province of Ontario, for example, there are 357,000 people who receive social assistance and live below the poverty line. Food banks have experienced a 15% increase in demand in this year alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145494">The same food banks also report that so desperate are some of their clients that 28% of them have had to use credit cards or lines of credit just to pay for food and shelter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145495">These are Canadians not unlike any other person we know. They are hard-working people caught up in difficult economic times who simply want to provide for their families and live decent and dignified lives. They are not looking for a hand out, but a step up. </ParaText>

But the truth is, more than ever, that they are not invisible, they are unnoticed. It is not the same thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2145498">In many respects their lives are uncomfortable reminders to us all that we too are vulnerable. We owe it to them and to our country's future to see that we hear them, see them and do whatever we can to help them from the painful reality of poverty that can so often be cloaked with indifference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2145504">Our view is that the best way to fight poverty is to get Canadians working, and our economic action plan is doing just that by helping grow our economy and increasing the number of jobs. In fact ,we have created over 400,000 jobs since July 2009. We have done a number of things such as preserving and protecting jobs by job sharing. Over 250,000 jobs were protected. </ParaText>

We have reduced taxes right across the board.
