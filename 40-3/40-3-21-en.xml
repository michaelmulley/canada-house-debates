              <ParaText id="1842600">Mr. Speaker, yesterday the government ended funding for the Canadian Council on Learning. The centre began in 2004 under a Liberal government after reports that Canada ranked last in investment for early childhood education in the OECD, that 55% of Canadians were functionally illiterate and that 42%, nine million Canadians, performed below international standards.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842601">The centre's mandate is to measure and track new learning trends, and to develop new tools to improve learning. The provinces have found the CCL's work to be very important. The Secretary-General of the OECD wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to congratulate him on the organization's work.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842602">At a time when experts and 87% of Canadians agree that a highly skilled and educated workforce is critical to Canada's productivity and competition in the global economy, the work of the CCL will end. It is true that the CCL made us look in the mirror and see our warts but it offered solutions as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842603">I guess this is yet another example of a government that does not wish to hear the truth and thinks investments in research on critical issues are useless.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842604">Mr. Speaker, over 600 of us marched together on Sherbrooke Street on Sunday, carrying signs that read “Save the jobs” at the Shell refinery in Montreal East. Union members, community groups and citizens, the president of the union, Jean-Claude Rocheleau, the secretary of the FTQ, the mayor of Montreal East, Richard Deschamps from the City of Montreal, and almost all federal and provincial political parties, including the Leader of the Bloc Québécois and myself, came out to show our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842605">In closing one of the two remaining refineries in Montreal East, Royal Dutch Shell is taking away 800 direct jobs from Montreal and the province of Quebec, jeopardizing our petrochemical industry and threatening Quebec's energy independence. It is even worse that RDS wants to supply its 281 service stations—with more expensive gasoline refined elsewhere—from a terminal supplied by ships with the risk of environmental disaster on the river.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842606">Closing one refinery in East Montreal will not help save the environment; to do that, we must change consumer habits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842608">For many, Father Paul was a visionary of hope as the founder of the Brentwood Recovery Home. He was the driving force behind Brentwood since the founding of the detoxification and recovery home to help alcoholics and substance abusers more than 46 years ago when he was a parish priest in Windsor. Brentwood has helped more than 20,000 people, changing lives from despair to optimism for a better future. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842610">Father Paul was also a recipient of the Canadian Silver Jubilee Award, a doctorate of law degree, the Order of Ontario, the Queen's Confederation Medal, Windsor Achiever of the Century, the Golden Jubilee Medal and the Ontario Medical Association Award.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842611">For Father Paul's immediate family and the entire Brentwood family, I want to say that Father Paul was a great inspiration to all and will be missed by our entire community. He made life better for so many and his legacy will inspire future generations. I thank Father Paul.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842613">This national competition started with over 500 entries, so making the top 12 was a great accomplishment for Lawrencetown, a wonderful little community of fewer than 700 people. However, that accomplishment has now been topped. I am pleased to say that Lawrencetown is now one of the five finalists competing for the Hockeyville title.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842642">Canada has now benefited from five consecutive months of economic growth. The retail, construction and manufacturing sectors are showing real signs of recovery thanks to our tax cuts for families and businesses as well as our investments in job-creating infrastructure projects. Canada is weathering the current global economic challenges better than nearly every other industrialized country. However, our recovery remains fragile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842643">That is why our recently announced jobs and growth budget maintains the scheduled tax relief for businesses, reduces tariffs and completes year two of Canada's economic action plan. Our government's top priority remains jobs and economic growth. This is in contrast to the Liberals, who would raise the GST, impose a carbon tax and recklessly hike job-killing businesses taxes--</ParaText>

In fact, they point out that more Canadians die from asbestos than from all other causes combined in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842883">They also point out that, in spite of this, Canada remains one of the largest producers and exporters of asbestos in the world, dumping nearly 200,000 tonnes per year into underdeveloped and third world countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842884">Therefore, these petitioners from all over Canada call upon the government to ban asbestos in all of its forms and institute a just transition program for the workers who still work in that industry, to end all government subsidies to asbestos, both in Canada and abroad, and to stop blocking international health and safety conventions designed to protect workers from asbestos, such as the Rotterdam convention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842898">The airlines would need to inform passengers of all flight changes, either delays or cancellations. The new rules would need to be posted at the airport, and airlines must inform the passengers of their rights and the process they have to follow for compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842899">If the airlines follow the rules, it will cost them nothing. This type of legislation has been in effect in Europe for five years, and the question is why should an Air Canada passenger be treated better in Europe than in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842900">The petitioners call upon the government to support Bill <Document DbId="4327988" Type="4">C-310</Document>, which would introduce Canada's first air passengers' bill of rights.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842934"> I would like to make a statement about the events which occurred with relation to the recorded divisions taken on March 23, 2010. I would like to thank the hon. whip of the New Democratic Party and the hon. whip of the Bloc Québécois for their interventions on the matter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842935">During the taking of recorded division No. 12 last Tuesday, several members of the official opposition rose to vote on the motion when the nays had not yet been called. In response to calls from the floor to clarify what members were voting on, I interjected in the middle of the vote to state that I had not yet asked for those opposed to the motion to rise.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842936">Immediately thereafter, the chief opposition whip rose on a point of order seeking to have the votes stricken from the record. I proposed that we conclude taking the Yeas, before proceeding to the taking of the votes on the Nays. The hon. whip of the NDP objected that his party had found itself in a similar situation before, and had been denied consent to change their votes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842937">Following the taking of the division, further discussion ensued. At that time, the New Democratic Party whip added that it should be the first vote cast that should count.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842938">Before I address the specific issues raised concerning this vote, I would like to confirm that it is our long-standing practice that points of order are not entertained during the taking of a recorded division. Given the high level of noise and confusion surrounding this vote, I accepted to hear points of order in an effort to clarify the situation, but this should not have happened and my actions on this occasion should not be viewed as a precedent. Points of order related to the taking of divisions should continue to be raised after the results of a division are announced.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842939">With regard to the vote taken last week, members may be surprised to learn that it is not unheard of for members to vote twice, that is, both Yea and Nay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842940">Members should understand that when they rise to vote, the vote caller is obliged to call their names, even if they have already voted. Furthermore, a review of our past practice has failed to provide guidance on how to address this kind of issue. For instance, in some cases, members have simply clarified their intentions and the record was corrected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842941">I would invite members to consult the Debates of May 7, 2008, at page 5571 and the Debates of December 12, 2007, at page 2118 for examples of that approach.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842942">At other times, consent has been sought to have the votes cast in error to be corrected and recorded as the member actually intended. See the April 9, 2008 <I>Debates</I> at page 4709 for such an occurrence. If consent is granted by the House, the record is corrected; if it is denied, or if the duplication goes unnoticed, the original count showing members voting twice is left unchanged. Examples of such duplicate votes can be found recorded in the <I>Journals</I> of March 5, 2008, division No. 57, and September 28, 2005, division No. 102.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842943">In the case referred to by the whip of the New Democratic Party and the whip of the Bloc Québécois—which as far as the Chair can tell took place during a division taken on October 16, 2006—the House was faced with a significantly different circumstance. Contrary to what happened last week, the votes for the NDP had been counted only once, but on the wrong side of the question. Then, when consent was sought to have their votes recorded differently, consent was denied, just as it was denied last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842944">In this case, the House has been consistent in its actions. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="1842945">The March 23, 2010 <I>Journals </I> show that the names of several members are recorded as having voted both yea and nay for division No. 12 and consent was denied to have those duplicates recorded only as nays. Accordingly, the results of division No. 12 as recorded in the <I>Journals </I> will stand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842946">However, there appears to have been an error in recording divisions Nos. 13, 14 and 15. I have discussed the matter with the parties and I can now confirm that it was the intention of the House to apply the results of division No. 8, not division No. 12, to votes 13, 14 and 15. I therefore direct that the <I>Journals</I> be corrected accordingly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842950">As you know, Mr. Speaker, when the House wishes to request the production of documents, this can be done in two ways: by orders that documents be produced, as is the case here; and by the use of a humble address to Her Excellency the Governor General, to use the word of the address, “praying that she will cause to be laid before the House” particular documents. These are equivalent to command papers, that Erskine May says are presented nominally by command of the Queen. </ParaText>

It is not an address to the Governor General. However, on the list of documents subject to the order are many documents that fall into the category of papers requiring an address. Without limiting the list, these would include documents relating to the chief of the defence staff--and here I point out that the military is not a department of government; rather, the military is Her Majesty's Canadian Forces under the command of the Governor General--those relating to the Military Police Complaints Commission, documents relating to the proceedings in the Federal Court, and other documents.</ParaText>

This distinction, which corresponds to the constitutional origin of the departments, is still rigorously observed. It amounts to this--that information which is wanted from a department which originally grew out of the royal prerogative, such as a department of a secretary of state, is prayed for by an humble address to the crown, whereas information required from a financial department or from a department constituted under statute is demanded by an order of the House.</QuotePara>

However, I hasten to add that there is no instance, and I stress no instance, to be found where the Speaker has altered an adopted order to make it an address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842968">It is my submission that the Speaker has no such power once a decision to make an order has been adopted by the House, which is the case here. Nor is it open to the House to create any new privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842969">The prohibition found in section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, is but a reinforcement of the joint resolution of the Lords and Commons of 1704.

              <ParaText id="1842972">Mr. Speaker, on March 18, 2010, three members rose on questions of privilege: the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128161" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation>. As numerous representations were made by the opposition members on that day, I hope you will indulge with the opportunity to make submissions on all three points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842973">To begin with, it is not clear from the submissions of the three members as to what exactly was alleged as a prima facie case of a breach of privilege. For instance, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> proceeded to accuse members of this government and officials of the Department of Justice of everything from malice and subversive intent to constitutional sedition and conspiracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842974">On the other hand, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128161" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation> asked you, Mr. Speaker, to find a prima facie breach of a privilege based on the House order of December 10, 2009. Yet from the motion they proposed, should such a prima facie case were to be found, they made it clear that no actual breach of privilege had occurred since the original order lacked procedures to protect national security interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842975">Therefore, I will do my best to respond, first, to the questions raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>. Then I would request the opportunity to address the question raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128161" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842976">Turning to the issues raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, as I see it there are essentially two allegations before the Speaker regarding breaches of the House's privileges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842977">First, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> takes issue with a statement by <Affiliation DbId="147107" Type="96">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> in question period on December 1, 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842978">Second, the member takes issue with a letter from a senior law officer of the Crown to the law clerk of the House of Commons dated December 9, 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842979">I would submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that no prima facie breach is made out in either of these cases. I suggest that this question must, like all questions of parliamentary privilege, be considered in light of two guiding values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842980">First, as is well established in law and parliamentary practice, the principle of necessity must underscore all matters of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842981">Second, as parliamentarians, we should always be guided by a principle of great restraint when asserting privileges of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842982">This approach was expressed in a report from a 1967 United Kingdom select committee on parliamentary privilege when it recommended that parliamentary privileges and immunities should be exercised “as sparingly as possible and only when the House is satisfied that it is essential”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842983">Similarly, O'Brien and Bosc cite Joseph P. Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> that “A genuine question of privilege is therefore a serious matter not to be reckoned with lightly...and thus rarely raised in the House of Commons”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842984">Similarly, they cite the 1976 report of the special committee on rights and immunities of members, chaired by Speaker Jerome, in noting that “a question of privilege is a serious matter, when validly raised, but was frequently resorted to when no real question of privilege was actually involved”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842985">I suggest that no genuine question of privilege is before the Speaker today and that the dignity and efficiency of the House would be better served by dismissing the questions raised by the member opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842986">I would like to first emphasize that in my view the questions raised are primarily a matter of debate. Freedom of speech is essential in a free and democratic society. Freedom of speech is also the cornerstone of parliamentary privilege. Freedom of speech is essential in order to facilitate debate in the House and more generally in a democratic society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842987">This means there is an acceptance that members will hold differing views and they have the protected right to express those differences. That includes opinions as to the interpretations of laws.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1842988">The central issue before you, Mr. Speaker, is whether parliamentary privilege gives the House an absolute and unqualified right to order the production of documents and to receive the documents and whether any expression of views that it might not constitute a contempt of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1842989">On this point, I would remind the House that our parliamentary privileges are not indefinite, nor unlimited, but defined by the Constitution in the Parliament of Canada Act as those possessed by the United Kingdom House of Commons in 1867.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1842991">While there may be general agreement on the existence of parliamentary privilege, because our privileges are not codified, there are quite often debates on the scope of our privileges.</ParaText>

An example was in the case of Vaid, where the Attorney General of Canada and the House of Commons took different views on the scope of the powers of the House to regulate its internal affairs. We also saw in that case that the scope of the powers of the House was found to be more limited than that what had been claimed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843008">I first will turn to the allegation that the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, on December 9, 2009, is, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> alleged in his remarks on March 18, a slander of our House's powers and an attempt to intimidate witnesses. There are two fundamental issues with that allegation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843009"> First, the House is a place for debate, for the free expression of ideas and for members to put forth opposing views. The notion that a member could be in contempt of Parliament for stating an alternate point of view or a minority point of view would run counter to the fundamental principles of parliamentary privilege, which is the freedom of speech of members. It is natural, of course, that members will not always agree with one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843010"> The <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> made a statement responding to a question in question period. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> obviously disagreed with the minister's statement. This is no cause for alarm and it certainly is not a question of privilege. If such were the case, I am personally risking contempt today by speaking in opposition to the member's question. That is not the spirit, the practice nor the purpose of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843011">The second problem with this allegation relates to the minimal role that the Speaker is empowered to perform in relation to question period. As O'Brien and Bosc state at page 510:</ParaText>

In most instances, when a point of order or a question of privilege has been raised in regard to a response to an oral question, the Speaker has ruled that the matter is a disagreement among Members over the facts surrounding the issue. As such, these matters are more a question of debate and do not constitute a breach of the rules or of privilege.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="1843014">As I noted at the outset of my remarks, the practice of the House and in other jurisdictions has always been to acknowledge that some information ought not to be disclosed for considerations of public policy or national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843015">To hold today that the statement by the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> is a breach of the House's privileges rather than a question of debate would amount to foreclosing free speech and debate on an issue that has always been a matter of contention in Westminster parliaments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843016">I will now turn to the second issue raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, who claims that a letter from an assistant deputy minister of the Department of Justice to our law clerk obstructs public servants and threatens statutory and civil sanctions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843017">The hon. member's remarks in relation to the letter were unfair, injudicious and intemperate in the extreme. They impugned the good faith, professional competence and reputation of both a senior law officer of the Crown and the Department of Justice. The hon. member imputed possible motives of malice, subversive intent and a conspiracy to undermine Parliament. These allegations are baseless.</ParaText>

The letter was part of an exchange of views between legal counsel on a matter of law. On no reasonable view of the matter can the mere expression of a legal position by a law officer of the Crown constitute a breach of the privileges of the House.</ParaText>

To suggest that a legal adviser, who has a different opinion from our law clerk, from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128211" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> or even of the House as a whole, is somehow in contempt of the House would be an abuse of our parliamentary privileges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843092">Turning to the first point, Mr. Speaker. On December 9, 2009 a majority of this House voted in favour of the public disclosure of a very large number of documents that contained sensitive and confidential information. It did so despite repeated warnings from the government that the disclosure of this information would harm Canada's national security, international relations and national defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843093">In order for there to be a valid question of privilege, there must be evidence that the House and its members have been impeded in carrying out their parliamentary duties. I would argue that to the contrary, the government has made attempts to facilitate the work of members in holding the government to account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843094">The government wishes to provide members with the information that is necessary for them to perform their duty of holding the government to account. Ministers and public servants will always strive to provide parliamentarians with information in a full and transparent manner, but we must balance this obligation with our fundamental duty to protect information for reasons of national security, national defence and foreign relations. This has been our approach in relation to the issue of the transfer of Afghan prisoners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843095">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, the December order called for uncensored documents. It listed eight different categories of documents to be produced. The order did not specify exactly when such documents should be produced, who should produce them or to whom they should be produced. The order made no reference to the confidential information being protected or that the Security of Information Act or other laws would be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843096">Mr. Speaker, in light of this, I would like to take this opportunity to note the following facts for your information and for the information of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843097">First, the categories of documents listed in the order include tens of thousands of pages related to the transfer of Afghan prisoners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843098">Second, it is the firm position of the Government of Canada that the public disclosure of military and other secrets would be injurious to Canada's international relations, national defence and national security interests, if released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843099">The December motion indicated no means for safeguarding this information, which is the responsibility of the Government of Canada to protect. In the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation>'s submissions of March 18, he seemed to share our concerns, in which case the idea of a prima facie case is simply not presented. He stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843102">On March 5, I announced the appointment of the Hon. Frank Iacobucci to review the documents in question and thereby assist the opposition parties in holding the government to account. Mr. Iacobucci was appointed by the governor in council on the recommendation of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He has significant expertise and experience, which make him particularly well qualified to undertake this review. He is a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He recently served as commissioner in an internal inquiry that dealt with matters of national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843103">The government took this step to develop a reasonable response given the serious interests at stake. The order of December 10 did not require us to do this, since that order provided no protections for sensitive information. The government took this step to offer a very reasonable compromise between the complex and serious interests at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843104">On the one hand, as the member has acknowledged, the government cannot be expected to compromise Canada's national security interests. On the other hand, we want to provide as much information as we responsibly can to assist parliamentarians in their duties. Mr. Iacobucci will review the documents and make an objective independent assessment as to what he believes must be protected and what can be released in this context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843105">The legal instrument pointing Mr. Iacobucci provides that he will review all relevant documents and that his work is to be “completed expeditiously”. He will make those recommendations to me. He will also prepare a report summarizing his methodology and general findings. I will make this report available to members of the House and to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843106">The member, in his remarks, accused the government of using “national security as an excuse to hide embarrassing information”.

              <ParaText id="1843119">As recently as June 8, 2006, Mr. Speaker, you ruled that national security, when asserted by a minister, was sufficient to set aside the usual requirement to table documents cited in debate and that the Speaker had no role in assessing the documents for that purpose. This ruling was based on the ruling of the Deputy Speaker on November 2, 1983, which held that a minister could refuse to table a document cited in the debate where it was not in the public interest. In that case, the public interest was confidentiality of international diplomatic communications.</ParaText>

At some point secrecy must end and publicity begin, and at this juncture there must inevitably be a gap in knowledge and power 'to send for persons, papers and records' between the controllers and the controlled. If Parliament shares the secret knowledge, then the press and public must accept Parliament's viewpoint on trust; if Parliament is not privy to the secrets, then Parliament must accept some other person's conclusions on trust.

              <ParaText id="1843170">I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to the speeches from the two ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843171">When talking about this subject, I often begin my speech by talking about the protectors of the realm. They do an excellent job. Once again, the castle doors have been locked after what has just happened. We, the members of the grand inquest, must investigate the government's behaviour in all matters. It is important that we call on the government to table documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843172">I will talk about the debates shortly because we must all have the same information in order to debate. If we do not have the same information, how can we debate effectively?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843173">We have already said it, and we will say it again: Parliament has undisputed privileges that are recognized in the Constitution. Under these right and privileges, members can demand documents to ensure that the government is behaving properly in all matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843174">Since we are not getting the documents—it has been almost four months since the motion of December 10, 2009—what are we waiting for to act on the motion moved on December 10? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843175">As was the case last month and last week, they are scaling up their efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843176">On March 16, back in the House, the government realized this was a hot file. It did not know what to do and did not want to release the documents. It decided to appoint a highly skilled judge. We are not disputing his skills. He is indeed intelligent and competent, but this appointment is not a satisfactory response to the decision made on December 10, 2009. That is why we disagree with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843177">What is more, the mandate given to the judge has no end date. We still think this is a case of contempt. In a dramatic turn of events, last week we learned that the government was going to table 2,600 pages of documents. As the members of the grand inquest, as parliamentarians, we had renewed hope. We were finally going to find out whether the government was behaving properly in this case. We waited with bated breath for the documents to be tabled, but only one series of documents was produced. They had all night to photocopy those documents in order to hand them out to the various parties. To everyone's surprise, at first, there was only one series of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843178">As the grand inquest, we were required to seek permission to go behind the Speaker's chair where documents are kept in order to consult these documents. We were astonished to see that what we were looking at were more censored documents. It was yet another delay tactic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843179">Today, we expected the ministers of the Crown, the great protectors of the realm, to explain their actions, to tell us that we were right, to release a certain number of uncensored documents, and to trust us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843180">That is not what happened. I am not interested in camping out in front of Buckingham Palace in order to convince the Queen that this is an important matter and that she must intervene. Nor am I interested in parking myself at Rideau Hall to inform the Governor General that I have something to tell her. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843181">I have full confidence that the Speaker of the House of Commons will make the right decision in this matter. That is why I think they are stalling again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843200">Our Conservative government, through today's legislation, is working to address the long-term opportunities and challenges that our country will be confronting in the years ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843201">The jobs and economic growth act would accomplish that objective by bringing forward a range of economic measures to contribute to Canada's advantage now and for the future, for example, by: eliminating tariffs on manufacturing inputs and machinery and equipment; eliminating the need for tax reporting under section 116 of the Income Tax Act for many investments; narrowing the definition of taxable Canadian property; implementing important changes to strengthen federally regulated private pension plans; implementing the one time transfer protection payment to provincial governments announced in December 2009; regulating national payment card networks and their operators, if necessary; enabling credit unions to incorporate federally and operate as banks; making it easier for companies to offer telecommunication services to Canadians; stimulating the mining industry by extending the mineral exploration tax credit; creating greater tax fairness between single and two parent families with respect to claiming universal child care benefit amounts; implementing an enhanced stamping regime for tobacco products to deter contraband. There is much more in this document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843202">The jobs and economic growth act would also help restrain and focus spending. It proposes to freeze allowances and salaries for parliamentarians and reduce what are known as governor in council federal appointments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843203">Let us briefly look at a few of the aforementioned highlights of this legislation and hear what Canadians are saying about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843204">First, we are proposing to completely eliminate tariffs on manufacturing inputs and machinery and equipment. This bold action will position Canada as the first country in the G7 and G20 to be a tariff-free zone for manufacturing. Manufacturers across this country are applauding that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843205">Canadian manufacturers will be able to produce their quality goods right here in Canada without job-killing tariffs and without a web of productivity-draining red tape. This will give our manufacturers the competitive advantage they need to succeed in the global marketplace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843206">This important initiative will lower production costs, increase competitiveness and enhance innovation and productivity. More important, it is estimated that our move to make Canada a tariff-free zone for manufacturing will create 12,000 new, good quality jobs in the years ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843207">This legislation builds on key Canadian economic advantages, such as being home to the soundest financial system in the world, and allows us to boast the lowest tax rate in the G7 for new investment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="1843208">The jobs and economic growth act would truly make Canada an even more attractive place for new investment and for the new jobs it would create. This would also further assist in diversifying Canada's trade patterns. It would complement our Conservative government's efforts to grow freer trade with places like the European Union and India and implement recent agreements with Colombia, Panama and Jordan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843209">Since announcing this bold initiative, we have heard a lot of positive feedback. In earlier speeches on budget 2010, I relayed some of the feedback to the House. Today, I would like to draw the attention of the House to even more applause that has been received since that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843210">We have heard from business leaders like Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of Linamar Corporation, who praised the tariff reduction. She said, “Anything that we can do to reduce costs in terms of importing manufacturing equipment is going to be of benefit to us. We do buy a lot of equipment. We tend to spend somewhere between $180 million and $200 million a year on manufacturing equipment, so to improve the cost of that is going to be a benefit to us”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843211">Dani Reiss, CEO of that popular Arctic Canadian coat manufacturer, Canada Goose, also heralded it as “a great move...tariffs only made it more expensive to be a Canadian manufacturer. I think this move by the government will make made in Canada viable for more apparel companies”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843212">The Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership also calls the tariff-free zone “a big deal”, adding:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843214">Andrew Coyne, the respected public policy commentator and national editor for <I>Macleans</I> magazine cheered it as well. Andrew said that it is “terrific public policy, a shot in the arm for Canada's manufacturers, and a timely example to the rest of the world. It will lower costs, save on paperwork, and improve productivity. It will make Canada the G20's first tariff-free zone, and as such is likely to prove an attractive incentive to locate a plant here”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843215">I literally could devote my entire speech to passing along the many positive statements we have heard on the tariff-free zone for manufacturing initiatives that is simply a part of budget 2010 and legislated through the jobs and economic growth act. However, I would not have the opportunity to talk about many other great aspects of this bill, so I will move on. Maybe we could talk more about this later during the period for questions and comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843216">Let us talk about the major positive pro-growth reform to section 116 of the Income Tax Act. Specifically, the bill helps by eliminating tax reporting for investments such as those by non-resident venture capital funds in a typical Canadian high tech firm. This would enhance the ability of Canadian businesses to attract foreign venture capital, fuelling job creation and economic growth. We have also heard glowing praise for this move from all across Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843220">Another key element of the jobs and economic growth act is the important changes to strengthen federally regulated private pension plans. I am proud to say I was personally very involved in the development of these changes. By way of background, in early 2009, our Conservative government announced we would review issues related to pensions under federal jurisdiction, regulated by way of the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843221">This represented the first comprehensive review in nearly three decades. We started that process in January 2009 when we released for public comment a major research paper on legislative and regulatory regimes for federally regulated private pension plans. We followed that up with extensive cross-country and online public consultations open to all Canadians. We asked for input on the legislative and regulatory framework for federally regulated private pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843222">From March until May 2009, I travelled across Canada from Halifax to Vancouver to Whitehorse and many places in between. What is more, despite the challenging timelines and logistical challenges, we never once left anyone at the microphone who wanted to speak. Every single person who wanted to have his or her voice heard on this very important file was offered that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843223">Let me take a brief moment to express my thanks to all those people who took the time to participate in that process, either in person or online. Their involvement was central and absolutely necessary for the entire process to be both meaningful and successful. During that consultation I heard very unique, personal and raw stories. This focused my determination to get it right, to ensure that this landmark study of federally regulated private pensions and whatever reforms followed from it got it right. It was just too important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843224">We carefully reviewed all the submissions throughout the summer and into the early fall of 2009, when we announced a package of significant reforms to federally regulated pensions that, I humbly suggest, did get it right. There is one change I am particularly pleased with and it is included in the jobs and economic growth act. Namely, it is the requirement for plan sponsors who voluntarily wind up a pension plan to fund 100% of their contractual commitments to those plan members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843225">Travelling around Canada, time and again I heard troubling stories of various plan sponsors who made a decision to stop offering a defined benefit plan to their employees. On too many occasions, this meant that those retirees did not receive 100% of what they had been promised and deserved. The old framework actually allowed that to occur. We thought that was wrong, and that is why we are changing that in this act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843226">Other key reforms to federally regulated pensions in the jobs and economic growth act consist of the following: authorizing an employer to use a letter of credit if certain conditions are met, to satisfy solvency funding obligations in respect to a pension plan that has not been terminated in whole; establishing a distressed pension plan workout scheme, under which the employer and representatives of the members and retirees may negotiate changes to the plan's funding requirements, subject to the approval of the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>; and permitting the superintendent of financial institutions to replace an actuary if the superintendent is of the opinion that it is in the best interests of members or retirees. Much more was added into that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843227">I am happy to report that the reforms we announced were very well received by public interest groups and many commentators. Let me take a moment to share what I heard with the House. First, the National Association of Federal Retirees was “pleased to hear that the Government of Canada is taking action to strengthen the pension framework and enhance benefit security...”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843228"> Dan Braniff, founder of the Common Front for Retirement Security, in a letter to the Minister of Finance wrote, “On behalf of the Common Front for Retirement Security, I wish to congratulate you.... This is an important milestone for creating greater security for many pensioners and plan members.... We also wish to show our appreciation for the excellent work of [the member for Macleod] who travelled across Canada and obviously listened to the voices of pensioners.... Thank you for taking this very important step for better retirement security at this very critical time”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843229">Raymond Bertrand, president of Bell Pensioners' Group, in a letter to my office, added, “I am writing to you on behalf of the Bell Pensioners' Group to express our appreciation for the manner in which you have consulted with Canadians, and in particular pensioners, who are most affected by amendments.... You made sure the voice of pensioners was heard in the round table consultation process which you so ably led. You clearly identified that one of your main priorities was to protect the pension promise. On behalf of all our members, please accept our thanks for your willingness to move forward the very difficult policy agenda of pension reform”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843230">Ian Lee, of Carleton University Sprott School of Business, called the reforms “far-reaching because they do address some of the demands that were being made by pension advocates.... What it's going to do is create a framework that is going to allow for greater scrutiny...[and] change the rules whereby companies can contribute more money...in aggregate I think it's going to ensure that our pensions are on a better footing, a more solid foundation”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843233">One more positive element of the jobs and economic growth act that I would like to take a moment to highlight today is the provisions to enable credit unions to incorporate federally. In this legislation, we are proposing to create a federal legislative framework for credit unions. This is to promote the continued growth and competitiveness of the financial sector. Allowing credit unions to grow and be competitive on a national scale will broaden choices for consumers and attract new members. It will also improve services to existing members across provincial borders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843303">Madam Speaker, this is a result of several questions that come out of the KAIROS issue. KAIROS has had a funding relationship with all forms of governments over the last 35 years. As far as KAIROS knew, it complied in each and every respect with the government's latest set of priorities. In fact, it was told that many times over by various staff officials at the agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843304">Whatever the priorities were, they were complied with, and the officials were pretty satisfied that their funding would be restored. This funding is pretty important to KAIROS because it constitutes 42% of its base funding. It came as a great shock and a bit of a surprise to KAIROS when it literally received a phone call at 10:30 one night from the minister's office, saying that its funding had been cut. No real reasons were given other than that KAIROS did not comply with the minister's priorities, whatever the minister's priorities were at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843305">That was fine. A couple of weeks later, KAIROS learned that it was apparently an anti-Semitic organization according to the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation>'s speech in Israel. Not only did it have its funding cut after it thought it complied with all the priorities of the agency, but it was given a call in the middle of the night and it was called anti-Semitic as it was being booted out the door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843306">That is hardly a way to treat an organization representing something in the order of 11 church and para-church organizations who have had a funding relationship over 35 years, constituting about $7 million on an annual basis. That is hardly a way to treat decent people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843307">The various heads of the church and para-church organizations published a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, asking for an opportunity to clarify the situation. They asked him to sit down and have a chat. Even if they were not going to get their money back, they wanted to at least have a chat about what they were doing, what they were trying to do, and describe their reputation in a variety of communities in which they were working. They wanted to clear the air.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843308">That was in January and we are now in March. We are about to go into April and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has still not been able to find any time in his schedule to meet with the representatives of KAIROS. It really is a great shame because those folks represent something in the order of 70% of the Canadian population. There are a variety of churches from pretty well the entire spectrum, whether it is evangelists right through to Catholics, Anglicans, Presbyterians, et cetera.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843309">They are all in some state of shock that they should be treated in such a cavalier fashion. It is their view, and I think it is a right view, that this is no way in which to treat those organizations that are important and, in fact, critical to the functioning of our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843310">It transpires that there is funding that is going to go to the Congo. A newspaper article says that this funding in the Congo by CIDA is buttons and posters on the matters of rape. A $50,000 grant that KAIROS has is cut. CIDA, on the other hand, continues to fund buttons and posters, which is largely considered to be ineffective. This is a complete mess of priorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843311">Madam Speaker, I suppose we do reach points of disappointment with some of the opposition members. We have been down this furrow many times. I do not know how much deeper we can dig it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843312">The member, in his speech tonight, again has made some gross exaggerations, distortions of truth to the point of putting it in a place of unrecognizability. I really do not understand what he does not understand about setting priorities. Our government has set priorities and we have enunciated those priorities in a very public way. KAIROS, along with every other organization with whom our government and previous governments have had a relationship, was aware of those priorities before it ever made its application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843313">Unlike the Liberals, who just used to take taxpayers' money and kind of shovel it out the door and see what kind of results they could get, we have decided that we are going to be very precise. We want to increase food security. We want to put an emphasis on children and youth, and we want to create a situation of sustainable economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843314">Further, we have now come to our 20 countries of focus. It might be of interest to the member, maybe not, I do not know, but I happen to have had a meeting with a foreign affairs minister from Africa just yesterday. He came to Canada with a tremendous question in his mind, “What have we done wrong as a nation? Why is our relationship with Canada falling apart?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843315">It was based, in no small part, on the kind of exaggerations that the member, the Liberals, the Bloc and the NDP have all been creating; this myth, this aura that somehow we are not concerned about countries like Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya and in that area, and other countries of Africa. He came with this big question, “What have we done wrong?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843316">I sat down and I took 20 minutes with him and I went through our program as to what our 20 countries of focus are all about and what our priorities are. I told him that there was a much bigger picture that he could take advantage of going into the future. After 20 minutes he was totally satisfied because he had been persuaded by me that in fact the distortions that have been created by our political opponents, for their own Canadian domestic needs, was incorrect. When he left with the correct information from me on behalf of the government, he was perfectly happy and perfectly satisfied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843317">Member organizations that relate to KAIROS, in fact, over the last three years have received $100 million. If KAIROS wishes to reapply in another season at another time, and comply with our priorities, it too would have the opportunity to be successful in receiving funding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843318">Madam Speaker, my guess is that the person with whom he was talking certainly did not get any money because the African states are, in fact, pretty upset with the Government of Canada. They feel like they have been abandoned and they have a legitimate beef.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843319">However, let us just deal with the priorities. The government is fond of priorities. It has priorities every day of the year and they are new priorities. It is sort of like applying for a grant based upon today's weather for next year. The point is that not only do the priorities change but they bear no relationship to the Official Development Assistance Accountability Act, which was passed by this House in 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843320">There are only three priorities that the government has: poverty alleviation, taking into account the perspectives of the poor, and international human rights. The rest is nonsense. Those are the only priorities for the government. That is the law and unfortunately, the government does not choose to apply the law that was passed unanimously by this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843321">As a consequence, we end up putting organizations like KAIROS at risk. This goes on and on, and it has to stop.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="1843322">Madam Speaker, apparently, I have been speaking to the deaf because the reality is that we have set priorities and these priorities have been well publicized, unlike the Liberals who just used to shovel money out the door.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843323">Furthermore, the member is completely distorting the truth when he says that the countries of Africa are concerned. It was our government, of all of the G8 countries, that ended up doubling our aid to Africa in the last five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="1843324">For him to stand and say that they are concerned because the aid is being cut is simply untrue, and quite frankly unworthy of the member.</ParaText>
