              <ParaText id="2418046">Order, please. I am now prepared to rule on the question of privilege raised on March 10, 2011, by the <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> concerning an alleged sit-in at his Parliament Hill office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418047">I wish to thank the minister for having raised this matter and the members for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> for their comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418048">In raising this question of privilege, the <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> explained that on Wednesday, March 9, 2011, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> arrived at his office, uninvited and accompanied by a group of the Sayisi Dene and media representatives, pressing his staff for an immediate meeting despite his absence. In his view, this constituted a protest and a sit-in. Characterizing the incident as a serious breach of trust and a serious matter from a security standpoint, the minister expressed concern that his employees were made uncomfortable and prevented from doing their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418049">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> countered that the visit was simply an attempt to obtain a meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> and not an orchestrated event with the intention of obstructing the work of the minister's office.</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Over the years, members have regularly brought to the attention of the House instances which they believed were attempts to obstruct, impede, interfere, intimidate or molest them, their staffs or individuals who had some business with them or the House.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2418054">In the case before us, the Chair is being asked to determine whether the unauthorized presence in the minister's office of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>, a delegation of the Sayisi Dene and the media was tantamount to intimidation or obstruction of the <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">minister</Affiliation>'s staff. To assist me, I reviewed the report on this matter prepared by House of Commons security, who attended the scene after being called upon for assistance by the minister's staff. It is clear to the Chair from the submissions, as well as the security report, that those occupying the minister's office were uninvited and did not have proper authorization to be there. As well, the Chair believes that the minister's staff was indeed uncomfortable, though they appeared to have handled the situation with aplomb and good grace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418055">I am troubled that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>, without prior warning, took it upon herself to lead a group to another member's office. That media representatives were part of this group makes the situation that much more unfortunate. No matter how well intentioned the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> was, or how amicable the outcome of this particular incident, it was an unauthorized presence in a minister's office that left ministerial staff uncomfortable enough to warrant the assistance of security. It is a credit to the minister's staff, and it must be said to the unexpected visitors as well, that this incident did not escalate further and that the tone of the exchange was respectful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418056">It is well understood that members need access to ministers to fulfill their parliamentary functions but it is equally true that there are various well-known, entirely acceptable avenues available to secure such access. Members are expected to avail themselves of these mutually agreed upon opportunities rather than resorting to other unorthodox means that may place colleagues in untenable situations. Because of the actions of the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>, for almost an hour, her guests occupied the office of the minister without a previously arranged appointment. This is a clear abuse of the usual practices that all members are expected to follow. The Chair is disappointed that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> showed a complete disregard for the common courtesies that are to be observed between members. In this case, the situation was well managed, but we may not always be so lucky.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2418057">It does not require a great deal of imagination to foresee the kind of circus atmosphere that could result if all members took it upon themselves to escort constituents, delegations or other citizens—however worthy their cause or objective—to whichever other member's office they chose.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2418058">That being said, in this particular case, in large part due to the calm, measured approach taken by the <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">minister</Affiliation>'s staff in handling the situation, there is little evidence to suggest that the staff of the <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> were obstructed in the fulfillment of their duties. The <Affiliation DbId="157731" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> himself was careful not to overstate the impact of the incident on his staff. In view of the very high threshold required in adjudicating such situations, in this circumstance the Chair cannot find that a prima facie question of privilege has arisen in this matter.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2418059">The Chair expects that all members will heed the lesson of this incident in an effort to maintain the integrity of the precinct as a work environment where all members feel secure and respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418060">I ask for the active collaboration of all members in this and I thank all members for their attention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418078">This is a historic day in the life of Canadian democracy, the democracy that you, Mr. Speaker, have served so well. I have to inform the House that the official opposition has lost confidence in the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418080">Our motion asks the House to agree with the finding in the 27th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs presented on March 21. This was a historic finding. It was the first time that a parliamentary committee has found the government in contempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418081">Today, with this motion, we ask the House to do the same, to find the government in contempt and to withdraw the confidence of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418082">With this motion, we are calling on members of Parliament to condemn the government for its contempt of Parliament and to withdraw the confidence of the House. This is a historic day in the life of Canadian democracy, but it is also an opportunity for us to confirm our commitment to parliamentary democracy and its fundamental principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418083">What principles are we talking about? That the government has the obligation to provide members of this House with the information they need in order to hold the government accountable to the people of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418084">The principle at stake in this debate goes to the heart of parliamentary democracy: the obligation of a government to provide members of this House with the information they need in order to hold the government accountable to the people of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418085">We are the people's representatives. When the government spends money, the people have a right to know what it is to be spent on. Parliament does not issue blank cheques. For four months, the opposition has asked the government to tell the Canadian people the true cost of its budget plans. For four months, we demanded to know how much Canadian taxpayers were being asked to pay for fighter jets, prisons and corporate tax breaks. For four months. this House and the Canadian people were stonewalled by the government and they are being stonewalled still. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418086">For four months, we have been trying to hold this government accountable. For four months, we demanded to know the real cost of the fighter jets, prisons and tax breaks for major corporations. For four months, we did not get a single answer, aside from the contempt and arrogance of this government. And today, still, we have no answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418087">We were shocked, but we were not surprised. After all, this is the same government that shut down Parliament twice, the same government that was forced, by one of your rulings, to hand over documents to do with Afghan prisoners, and we are still waiting for those documents.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2418088">In the case of the Afghan documents, the government's excuse for withholding the truth was national security. In the case of the budget documents, it invented something about cabinet confidence, but actually it did not even bother with an excuse at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418089">But you, Mr. Speaker, would have none of it. You, Mr. Speaker, held that the rules of our democracy require the government to answer the questions that Parliament wants answered. The matter was sent back to a committee for action and it came back with a finding of contempt. That is why we are where we are today. The House must decide whether the government has broken a basic rule of our democracy and therefore, whether it can remain in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418090">For our part on this side of the House, there is no doubt. You, Mr. Speaker, have spoken, the committee has spoken, and now the House must speak with a clear voice. It must say that a government that breaks the rules and conceals facts from the Canadian people does not deserve to remain in office.</ParaText>

The House should also affirm Canadians' hunger, nay their longing, for change. It is time to change Canada's direction. It is time to get us on the right path.

It wants to spend 1,000 times more on fighter jets than on helping students in CEGEP and university. We reject the government's priorities. It is offering less to seniors for an entire year than what it spent on one day of the G20. We say no to this kind of waste. The government wants to spend 1,000 times more on prisons than on preventing youth crime. Again, we say no. This government's priorities are not in line with the priorities of Canadian families.

There is no credible plan to tackle the deficit because there are no numbers any reasonable person can believe in. There is no vision of how to sustain our health care system. There is not a word about affordable housing, not a word about child care, and nothing for the pressing needs of Canadian families in poverty.</ParaText>

We need to focus scarce resources where they really matter: early learning and child care; college and university education for all, especially for aboriginal and immigrant Canadians; energy efficiency and green jobs; family care for our loved ones in the home, and security and dignity in retirement. We need all of this plus a clear plan to clean up our country's finances and get us back to balance without adding to the tax burden on Canadian families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418108">Mr. Speaker, you referred this issue to the procedure and House affairs committee. You said it was a prima facie breach of privilege, which means on the surface it appeared there was a breach of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418109"> I had the honour and privilege of sitting on that committee during a constituency week when members should have been back in their ridings. We listened to some great input in committee. We heard from Mel Cappe, a number of ministers, and many other witnesses during the two days of hearings, and then a third day for another matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418110">The problem is that the decisions of that committee, which should have been made after the input was received, were made long before the committee ever met. At the end, the committee was presented with the demands of the coalition opposition, one of which was that there would be a maximum of two pages in the report, two days of hearings and two pages in the report. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418111">What is worse, the coalition demanded that there be no summary of evidence presented at the meetings to the House of Commons. We can talk about democracy and the contempt of parliamentary process, but I would ask my hon. colleague this question. If we do not provide information on the process that the procedure and House affairs committee went through for three days here in Ottawa, is it not a contempt of the parliamentary privilege of the members of the House?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418126">Mr. Speaker, my colleague and friend from <Affiliation DbId="128541" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation> asks a question that essentially transports us out of the precincts of the House and asks what this means to ordinary Canadians, the families watching at home and people at work. This is a question that affects them directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418127">Many Canadians enjoy the very special privilege of rich and lucky countries, of not having to think and worry about their democracy. They entrust its protection to their representatives. They do not think about whether their democracy is in danger.

              <ParaText id="2418128"> However, in the deep background of their lives, there must always be a confidence that their democracy works and that it works for them, and that when members of the House ask a government questions about how taxpayer money is spent, they get an honest answer. That is the crux of our democratic system, that on behalf of the woman taking her son or daughter to hockey practice, on behalf of the man going to work in the mill, they can count on us in the House of Commons to ask the questions that those citizens need to know in order to hold our government accountable. When that government fails in this most elementary task of democratic freedom, it is the duty of the members of the House to bring the government down.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418131">I wish I could say I am pleased to make this speech today, but I am not.

              <ParaText id="2418132">Yesterday, I listed 10 important government bills which had received royal assent this week, bills like Bill <Document DbId="4445038" Type="3">S-6</Document> to eliminate the faint hope clause, Bill <Document DbId="4668958" Type="3">C-48</Document> to eliminate sentencing discounts for multiple murderers and Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> to get rid of early parole for white-collar fraudsters, a bill the Liberal leader opposed.

              <ParaText id="2418133">We also tried to pass important bills like Bill <Document DbId="4696220" Type="3">C-49</Document>, which would crack down on human smugglers and those who would take advantage of our generous immigration laws, and Bill <Document DbId="4497965" Type="3">S-10</Document>, which would get tough on drug dealers and date rape artists who would target our youth. I stood in this place just yesterday and asked for those bills to be passed. What was the response from the opposition coalition in passing these bills? No. No to getting tough on human smugglers. No to getting tough on drug dealers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418135">I know the Liberal members over there claim that the government was found to have done something wrong. What they are not telling Canadians is that this was an opposition-stacked committee that used the tyranny of the majority to get the predetermined outcome it wanted. Let us be clear. It was predetermined.

              <ParaText id="2418136">In my speech I could focus on all the abuses of parliamentary democracy and the absolute contempt that the opposition demonstrated, not just at that committee but on virtually every other committee of the House in overruling chairs, in making political decisions, ignoring the rules of this place, and on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418137">One may ask why we have never heard about these things. It is because the opposition coalition has a majority on every committee. Its members were the ones who demonstrated real contempt for Parliament, and they will have to answer to the Canadian people for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418138">Let us be clear about what this vote of non-confidence is really about. It is a vote against the next phase of Canada's economic action plan. It is a vote against our low tax plan for jobs and economic growth. It is a vote against hard-working Canadians and their families. It is a vote that will weaken Canada's economic recovery.</ParaText>

It provides potential employees with new opportunities to train and to hone those skills. It invests in innovation. It lays the groundwork for private sector growth to replace government stimulus. This is good for all Canadians in every region of our great country from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418141">For seniors across Canada, I am proud to report that our government is delivering once again. For the poorest of seniors, we are providing an important hike to the guaranteed income supplement. For people caring for infirm loved ones, we are providing support in the form of a $2,000 tax relief credit. For the many public servants who make their homes in my riding, we are providing a guarantee that we will not slash programs and eliminate jobs as the Liberals did in the mid-1990s. Instead, we will provide a strategic review to enhance efficiency and reduce overall overhead with minimal impact on service to Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418143">I hope Canadian colleges and universities will drive innovation and help Canada forge closer ties with promising markets like India's. Carleton University made a great proposal to do just that, but it will have to wait. We will certainly be supporting our students in new ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418144">I am especially proud to say that our government is providing real support to people who find their pensions at risk because their employer goes bankrupt. The budget would provide at least some help from the federal government to the former Nortel workers, despite the fact their pension plans were provincially regulated. It is something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418145">Unlike previous but misguided efforts in this place, this will not hurt Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418146">In short, Canada's economic action plan is another huge help for people in my riding of Ottawa West—Nepean. It will be a huge help to my home province of Ontario. We are working closely with the government of Dalton McGuinty to cut corporate taxes to make Ontario and Canada a magnet for jobs, investment and opportunity. It will be a huge help from coast to coast to coast right across our great country. It will help secure our economic recovery. It will help create jobs and it will support all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418147">By voting against this motion of non-confidence in our government, the opposition coalition can stop this unnecessary and unwanted election later today.

The government has failed to account for that, has failed to respond to it, has failed to address it and now pretends it does not even exist.

They over-governed Ontario. They over-regulated in Ontario. They killed jobs. They killed opportunities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418157">Mr. Speaker, the government House leader certainly has been trying very hard to spin Conservatives' record as something that is supporting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418158">We have seen him do this day after day in the House of Commons. I think he has become very familiar with it.

He could not even keep a straight face yesterday as he tried to ram through a whole bunch of government bills that he knew was impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418159">The fact is that the real record of the government is that it has the worst record on scandals in this country. It has the worst record of disclosure and of not providing information, not only to parliamentarians but to the people of Canada. It has the worst record on insider scams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418160">Day after day we have had to go through a litany of these issues and expose what the government refuses to disclose to the people of Canada. The fact that we are now, at this moment in this Parliament, finding contempt surely must be something that deeply disturbs even Conservative members.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418166">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to a motion put forward by the leader of the opposition. I must state at the outset that I find it strange that we are debating this motion when the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> introduced a motion in the House two days ago relating to the same matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418167">Why did he do that? He did it to avoid debate on the issues that matter to Canadians. He did it to avoid debate on the excellent budget that was introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and our government. He did it to avoid having a vote on the budget that is in the best interests of Canadians, including his own constituents. That is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418168">The Liberals, Bloc Québécois and NDP coalition have been caught up in political and partisan games at the expense of the best interests of Canadians. We have seen them time and time again play these games both in the House and in committees. They are the ones who have contempt for this House and for Canadians by forcing an unwanted, unnecessary election. I suppose we should expect nothing less from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418169">Let me address the report from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. It is a report that in no way reflects the committee's hearings. Despite receiving all of the information requested and hearing clear, reasonable testimony from ministers, public servants and independent experts, opposition members were determined to rig the outcome of the committee hearings. It was a true kangaroo court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418170">However, they were not content with that alone. Now they want to act as judge and jury for the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation>. They want to use their tyranny of the majority to find her guilty when the evidence from committee shows quite the opposite. There is nothing so blind as a closed mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418171">Let me speak for a minute about the Liberals. The Liberal Party should not be speaking about ethics. This is the same party that stole $40 million from Canadians. While it paid back a measly amount, much of it remains unaccounted for. I understand that 13 ridings benefited from this scandal. That is a lot of envelopes filled with tainted money funnelled through back doors of the Liberal Party. I ask the Liberals, where is the $40 million? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418172">When one is asked, “What first comes to your mind when you hear Liberal at the federal level?”, the answer certainly is not ethics. The answer is corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418173">The Liberal plan is tainted. This is the ad scam party that opposes laws that would prevent drug dealers from targeting children outside their schools. This is the ad scam party that opposes laws to end early parole for criminals who prey on seniors who have worked all their lives to comfortably retire. This is the ad scam party whose own members cannot even play by the rules. They want to talk about ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418174">When the Liberal immigration critic said that calling so-called honour killings barbaric went too far, what did the leader do? Nothing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418176">That is some ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418177">Now I turn to the Bloc. Who do the Liberals want to form a coalition with? The Bloc Québécois, a party whose primary goal is to stand against Canada, a party whose members, like the member for <Affiliation DbId="128135" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation>, have attended events and fundraisers organized by the RRQ, a group that includes neo-FLQ terrorists, a party whose policies are all about metropolitan Montreal, forgetting the regions of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418178">It is our Conservative government that has delivered for every part of Canada and every region of Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418183">The Bloc Québécois is purely trying to distract Quebeckers from the fact they have done and can do nothing for the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418184">It voted against our world leading economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418185">It voted against opening trade with the world for Quebec businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418186">It also voted against legislation that would impose mandatory minimum sentences for people convicted of child trafficking.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418188">The NDP members support an opportunist election that would not only kill the government's legislation, but also the legislation they have introduced. They would stop a bill that would provide low-cost drugs to Africa, a bill the member for <Affiliation DbId="128755" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> now sponsors. They clearly planned on campaigning on the introduction of their private members' bills, but not on the passage of these bills. How is that for ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418189">Why would they introduce legislation they do not care about? Probably for the same reason they invited media to tour their war room a few months ago. They have obviously been scheming with their coalition partners for this election for months. The same plan they revealed to Canadians in 2008, a coalition with Liberals in the driver's seat, the NDP spending taxpayers' money with abandon and the Bloc Québécois with a veto on every policy of the coalition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418190">When it comes to following up on promises, the NDP cannot be trusted. An example is the member for <Affiliation DbId="128569" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>, who flip-flopped on his position on the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry when it came down to the final vote. The minute that his vote would make a real difference for law-abiding duck hunters and farmers in this country, what did he do? He jumped ship. He turned tail. He is not the only one. The members for <Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128444" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128596" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128499" Type="2">Nickel Belt</Affiliation> all flipped their votes. I hope their voters will flip them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418191">How can seniors and families in their ridings trust them to make the best decisions when they flip-flop on policy because parts of their caucus are worried about losing their seats? I do not want to hear them talk about misleading. What they have done is misleading their constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418192">I believe that we have accomplished a lot in this session. Just this week, 12 new laws have been granted royal assent. These new laws are repealing the faint hope clause, cracking down on crooked consultants and protecting children from online sexual exploitation. Unlike the other parties, our Conservative government is here to make Parliament work, and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418193">The motion before us makes a mockery of Parliament. Canadians expect and deserve better. For the last five years we have delivered. We have steered Canada through the great recession. We have cut all forms of taxes the government collects. We provided seniors with pension income splitting. We reduced the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%. We introduced important tax credits: the Canada employment credit, the work income tax benefit, the child tax credit. The budget before the House goes even further while making targeted investments in people and our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418194">The other parties have no plans and no ideas to offer, so they resort to smear and slander. We have witnessed committees they control turned into kangaroo courts. We have seen them use the cover of privilege to try to convict the innocent. We are now seeing them force an unwanted election on Canadians and mislead them about their intent to form a coalition of the Liberal Party, the Bloc Québécois and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418195">One last jarring thought: If the coalition were to come about following the election, picture the Bloc in charge of public security, the NDP in charge of finance and the Liberals in charge of accountability. God help Canada. But enough fiction. Canadians are smarter than that. They can count on a Conservative government to stand up for their priorities and stand up for Canada.</ParaText>

All judicial matters were cleared up a few months after that first encounter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418498">After becoming government House leader, I had an opportunity to visit the Palace of Westminster, the mother of all parliaments. The Speaker of the House of Commons there said that he and Speakers in the Commonwealth around the world looked to you as their leader and their inspiration as someone who has conducted himself very professionally. For a Canadian to hear that from a British Speaker is a pretty remarkable conclusion and assessment of your role as Speaker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418506">With your departure, Mr. Speaker, this place loses a faithful guardian of our best traditions. We also lose a fierce protector of its privileges. Few Canadians have done more to affirm the supremacy of Parliament. Three times in the last year, you have stood in this House to defend our democracy against the abuse of power. Your rulings are the consummation of a career spent in the service of our institutions and they will echo in the history of our Parliament. For your devotion to this place, you have our gratitude and our respect.</ParaText>

I wish to salute her.</ParaText>

Not only are you the longest-serving Speaker in the history of Canada's Parliament, but you managed this feat in a very special context. This has been pointed out, but I believe it deserves to be repeated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418511">What I would like to say is that, on four occasions, after four consecutive elections, no matter which party was power, no matter whether it was a majority or minority government, the member for Kingston and the Islands was elected by his peers to preside over our deliberations and to be the guardian of the rules of procedure and the traditions of the House of Commons. In my opinion, the confidence the House has expressed in you, four times over, and in a secret ballot, is a great feat, even more than your longevity as the Speaker of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418512">If I had to describe your work in one sentence, I would say that it is obvious that all your actions have been guided by your profound knowledge of the institution of the House of Commons. This knowledge is the fruit of your hard work and obvious passion for parliamentary business. It is public knowledge that, even as an adolescent, the Speaker of the House was an avid reader of <I>Hansard</I>. Of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418513">With this in-depth knowledge of the institution, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128155" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> quickly became the defender of the rules and traditions of the House of Commons at a time when, need we be reminded, these rules and traditions could easily have been diminished. In fact, for more than five years, you have presided over a House of Commons with a minority government. Since 2004, with a number of your decisions, you ensured that the balance between parliamentarians' rights and the government's prerogatives was maintained. It was not always an easy task, I must say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418514">We will remember you, in your role as the Speaker of the House of Commons, as a man with an engaging personality and whose integrity, intelligence, judgment and knowledge, not to mention sense of humour, have been a source of admiration and inspiration for us all throughout these years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418515">Therefore, Mr. Speaker, allow me to offer, on behalf of the members of the Bloc Québécois and myself, our most sincere congratulations for the quality and longevity of your tenure as Speaker of the House of Commons.

              <ParaText id="2418599">I am very pleased to present a bill that aims to rectify a gap in our employment insurance regime. Currently, EI payments for qualifying restaurant servers are not calculated so that the servers' tips are taken into account, even though they are included when they pay taxes. That means that the EI payments servers receive are not based on their actual income but on their wages, which are very often low, as is a custom in the restaurant industry. This leaves servers at a significant economic disadvantage when they lose their jobs. It is unfair and discriminatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418600">This bill would make it mandatory for servers to claim their tips as income and that EI calculations be based on that total amount. It would give servers the economic security and equal footing that they deserve.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="2418714">Mr. Speaker, the federal tobacco control strategy, FTCS, has been successful in reducing smoking in Canada and preventing youth from starting to smoke. Canada is internationally recognized as a world leader in tobacco control. According to the World Health Organization, WHO, Canada has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world. In 2009, overall smoking prevalence in Canada was 18% and only 14% of Canadians were daily smokers. Data on 2010 and 2011 smoking prevalence are not yet available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418715">The current federal tobacco control strategy is 10 years old, and strategies to reach Canadians since then have evolved.  In that context, Health Canada is examining the strategy to ensure a clear role for the federal government in this area of shared jurisdiction with the provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418716">Given the pervasive and serious nature of the problem of tobacco use in our society, the Government is continually assessing new ways to maintain and enhance the effectiveness of its tobacco control measures.  </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418717">One such initiative is the Cracking Down on Tobacco Marketing Aimed at Youth Act, which fully came into force on July 5, 2010.  The act added further restrictions on tobacco advertising, as well as minimum packaging requirements for little cigars and blunt wraps, which ends the industry practice of selling these products in single units and “kiddy-packs”. The act also banned the use of certain additives, including flavours, excluding menthol, in cigarettes, little cigars and blunt wraps, as they contribute to making such products more appealing to youth.

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418718">On December 30, 2010, the Government of Canada announced proposed regulations to launch new, larger graphic health warning messages that will cover 75 percent of cigarette and little cigar packages in order to increase awareness of the health hazards associated with tobacco use and to further support smokers in their efforts to quit. These new health warning messages will be complemented by a multimedia social marketing campaign, including the use of social media tools, such as Facebook and Twitter, to reach and engage smokers. Subject to provincial and territorial agreement, the new labels will also include a pan-Canadian toll-free quitline number that will seamlessly link callers to provincial and territorial cessation support services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418719">The Government of Canada is committed to developing innovative approaches that effectively reduce smoking uptake among youth and help Canadian smokers to quit smoking. Health Canada will continue to seek innovative approaches to tobacco control and implement the necessary measures to reduce smoking rates and protect the health of Canadians.

              <ParaText id="2418720">The Government of Canada is examining the strategy to ensure a clear role for the federal government in this area of shared jurisdiction with the provinces and territories, including the use of grants and contribution funding.

              <ParaText id="2418753">Madam Speaker, the motion we are debating today is on the confidence that every government must earn and keep.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418754">We are dealing with a government that has woven a web of deception, attacked democracy and demonstrated an utter lack of integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418755">We are dealing with a government and a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who have written off Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418756">It is no longer possible to have any confidence in this Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418757">The fact that it was found guilty of contempt of Parliament, a first in the history of Canada, is serious enough in and of itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418758">It was not just a simple mistake and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot suggest that there were extenuating circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418759">The Conservative leader's decision to hide the truth was premeditated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418760">What is more, the Conservative leader is a notorious repeat offender. He and his party have quite the rap sheet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418761">The Conservative leader and his entourage have turned deception and trickery into a system of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418762">They have simply been making up the facts and fudging the truth, as we saw in the case of the Afghan detainees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418763">It goes on like that, deception after deception.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418764">For example, when it came to the procurement of fighter jets, the government hid the numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418765">The Conservatives' populist law and order bills are going to cost several billion dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418766">The Conservative leader and his cohorts have decided to adopt the American approach, one that has unfortunately failed and that costs a lot of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418767">They know it but, for them, it is not the actual results of public policies that matter, it is the ideological results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418768">The Conservative leader knows very well that, if the public learns that his policies are costing billions of dollars, he will fail in his attempt to impose his ideological agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418769">For years, the Conservative leader and his cohorts have claimed to want to fix the justice system, but each time they were given the opportunity to abolish automatic parole after one-sixth of the sentence has been served, they refused, finding a new pretext for doing so each time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418770">The Conservatives did not hesitate to spread falsehoods about the Bloc Québécois and it took widespread indignation about the release of Vincent Lacroix for them to stop their hyper-partisan game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418771">Another example: the Conservatives want the public to believe that they are responsible for the economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418772">It is the exact opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418773">Had there not been a proposed coalition against his government at the end of 2008, the Conservative leader would have sunk the Canadian and Quebec economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418774">The only reason why there is a stimulus plan, an unsatisfactory one at that, is because the opposition parties made him come up with one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418775">Today the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that even the idea of a coalition is illegitimate, but he is misleading the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418776">In 2004, he himself planned to form a similar coalition, and he knows it. I will read the letter he wrote, which I signed, as did the leader of the NDP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418779">Another lie: for months the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been saying that he does not want an election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418786">After so much deceit, how can anyone have confidence in the Conservative leader and his entourage? Especially since the case against the Conservatives is so strong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418787">Not only has there been contempt of Parliament, but also patronage, influence peddling, electoral fraud and RCMP investigations. The Conservative government handed out many partisan appointments, despite its promises to end that practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418788">A former advisor to the Conservative leader and the <Affiliation DbId="147118" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> is under criminal investigation. The party is facing charges for violating the Canada Elections Act, and I am not talking about one isolated incident. According to Elections Canada, we are talking about a premeditated system of electoral fraud. We are talking about violations committed by the highest authorities in the Conservative Party, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inner circle, and several of his ministers. For a party that claims to be the champion of law and order, it is rather pathetic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418789">The case against the government is very strong and there are no extenuating circumstances. The Conservatives are repeat offenders and definitely do not deserve the confidence of the people of Quebec. We therefore plan to vote in favour of the non-confidence motion against this government, this party and its leader. We will do so on this very question of integrity, but we will also do so because the Conservative leader has not honoured his commitments to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418790">The Conservatives wrote off Quebec in order to trigger an election. The Conservative leader made sure that the economic and financial needs of Quebec would be completely ignored. The refusal to give Quebec compensation for harmonizing taxes is a perfect example. Everyone agrees that this $2.2 billion compensation is a matter of basic fairness. All the parties in the National Assembly agree. The agreement is ready to be signed. Quebec has been waiting for 19 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418791">On Wednesday, the Prime Minister's political lieutenant from Quebec had the nerve to say that an election would delay negotiations with Quebec. That is taking people for fools, especially knowing that the Conservatives have done everything they could to trigger an election. The truth is that the Conservatives knew they would lose votes in Canada if they were fair to Quebec. The truth is that the Conservative MPs are prepared to sacrifice the interests of Quebec in order to obey their master. When the time comes to speak for Quebec, to represent the consensus in Quebec, they keep quiet, as usual. They deliberately chose to ignore Quebec and turn their backs on their province. Quebeckers will not forget that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418792">There is a total of $5 billion worth of disputes between Ottawa and Quebec that the Conservatives have completely ignored. We are talking about $630 for every Quebecker, including babies. For a family of four, this represents $2,500. Two thousand, five hundred dollars is the amount of money Quebec families have to do without for health services and education. For every Quebecker, there is a tangible loss of $630 per person. We will remind Quebeckers of that. Our requests meet with consensus and are simply fair. Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Atlantic provinces, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have all had their turn. Now it is Quebec's turn and the Conservative leader has chosen, with the complicity of his MPs from Quebec, to cast us aside. Quebeckers will not forget that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418793">When it comes to social programs, the Conservatives do not care about the middle class. The budget ignores the amply demonstrated need for real reform of employment insurance. The Conservatives do not care about the sad fate of the unemployed. The Conservatives distort the facts, as usual, by saying that with the eligibility threshold of 360 hours that the Bloc Québécois is calling for, people will receive 50 weeks of benefits. That is not true and they know it. With that threshold, in Gaspé, it is 32 weeks, in Lac-Saint-Jean it is 20 weeks and in Gatineau it is 16 weeks—not 50.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418794">What is worse is that the Conservatives are telling us that they will be helping themselves to the EI fund to pay down their deficit, as the Liberals did before them. I will be clear and frank: that is theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418795">In Quebec, the forestry industry has been in a crisis for over seven years and many mills have shut down, throwing thousands of workers onto the street. Older workers who lost their jobs need an assistance program. The Conservatives ignored that too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418796">Our poorest seniors were offered a small increase to their guaranteed income supplement, but no one is fooled; the Conservatives were just hoping to score some political points, since they did not even have the heart to bring in automatic enrolment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2418797">This means that thousands of seniors will be left in the lurch, without any resources. We can see the full extent of the deceit and cynicism of these ideologues who claim to want to help our poorest seniors. There is only one word to describe the Conservatives' offensive attitude, and that is “hypocrisy”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418798">This budget continued to ignore the economy in the regions. After the automotive industry in Ontario got a gift of $10 billion, it should have been the turn of Quebec's forestry industry. But no, all it got were some crumbs. It was the same for Quebec's manufacturing industry, which cannot count on an extensive federal policy to help it overcome the Canadian dollar's oil-fuelled rise in value. All the Conservatives have to offer the regions of Quebec are tangible losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418799">In short, any way we look at this budget, it is clear that the Conservatives have ignored Quebec. We will remind Quebeckers of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418800">And the files are piling up. Yesterday, for example, the government announced that it had reached an agreement with Quebec on the Old Harry site, off the Magdalen Islands. But the Conservative government refuses to accept its responsibilities and ratify the border agreement between Quebec and the Atlantic provinces that Newfoundland disputes. The Conservatives refuse to impose a moratorium on the exploration and development on the Newfoundland side until Quebec has completed its environmental assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418801">There is another question. When the agreement is signed, does the Conservative government intend to offer Quebec the same terms as Newfoundland, which received $4.5 billion under the side deals? This very Wednesday, the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> clearly stated that Canada' interests take precedence over those of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418802">The government is about to offer a loan guarantee for the installation of an underwater electricity cable that will save Newfoundland and Labrador hundreds of millions of dollars but will be detrimental to Hydro-Québec and, therefore, to all of Quebec. What are the Conservative members from Quebec doing? They take it lying down and saying nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418803">It is very clear that Quebec cannot trust the Conservatives with its future. It is even more apparent that the Conservative leader wants to obtain a majority and the risk that he will do so is very real. That is a real danger to Quebec. If it happens, the Conservatives would be free to impose their ideological policies, which are harmful and contrary to the interests and values of Quebeckers. The Conservative ideology is foreign and warlike; Quebeckers find it disgraceful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418804">We are talking about billions of dollars in additional and often useless military expenditures. The Conservative ideology means protecting the interests of big oil companies. It means more prisons and more guns in circulation. The Conservative ideology means continued assaults against the environment, the distribution of wealth, gender equality, science, truth and democracy. A Conservative majority means the completely negation of everything we are and new assaults against Quebec culture. It means that our economic interests will be completely ignored and our regions will be even more neglected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418805">We cannot ignore this threat. Quebeckers therefore have a very clear choice to make. On one hand, there are the Conservatives, who have a cynical, sneaky, deceitful and cheating attitude. Their goal is to obtain a majority so that they can impose their backward and dangerous ideology without anyone being able to stop them. And, when it comes time to speak on behalf of Quebec, the Conservatives do not say anything. They bow before their leader and turn their backs on Quebeckers. We saw this in Quebec City on the issue of the arena, as well as on many other issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418806">On the other hand, there is the Bloc Québécois, the only party in Quebec that is able to stand in the way of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s goals. Today, we are voting to show that the elected representatives of the Quebec people do not have confidence in this government, which has turned its back on Quebec. We cannot trust these Conservatives, who have tried to mislead the public, who have engaged in undemocratic behaviour and who have disregarded any notion of integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418807">The Conservative leader and his cohorts are known to be repeat offenders. They must be condemned without hesitation. They do not deserve our confidence. Today, it is the people's representatives who are voting. In a few weeks, it will be the voters' turn to do so. There is only one way to protect our values and democracy and that is through democracy itself.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2418818">In 2004, when the current Prime Minister was the opposition leader, he called a meeting in Montreal at the Delta hotel. He presented us with a plan indicating that the Governor General at the time, Adrienne Clarkson, had no other choice, if the Martin government was defeated on the fiscal imbalance—which was 30 seconds away from happening—and Mr. Harper would become prime minister. For that to happen, it is easy to understand that he had to have the support of the Bloc and the NDP on a throne speech or a budget, otherwise he himself would have been defeated.

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2418823">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House to speak to the non-confidence motion moved by the Liberals regarding the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418824">People know that I have been sitting in the House of Commons for about 14 years. The House of Commons is the place where laws are passed and where we determine a direction and a vision for our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418825">The Conservative government was elected in 2006 because it claimed to want to be a transparent government, a fair government, a government that believes in democracy, a government that does not believe in the Senate. I remind members that this is the same government that refused to hand over the documents we asked for on Afghanistan. We had to turn to the Speaker of the House, who forced us to hold meetings. Even there, the Conservatives refused, forcing the meetings to be held in camera. The NDP refused to participate in these discussions with the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Bloc. Today, we do not know what happened with that issue. There are only three individuals in Parliament who know; the rest do not know. That is not transparency and that does not respect a member of Parliament's right to have access to information, as the Speaker of the House said. We did not have that right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418826">Later, the Conservatives introduced some crime bills. For four months, the hon. members on the Standing Committee on Finance kept asking for information on the cost of these bills. How much would the megaprisons cost? How much would all this cost the provinces? The Conservatives introduced bills on young offenders. Rather than give us information, the government waited until it was forced by the Speaker of the House to come before the committee. The first day in committee, the government presented a large document, which was tabled yesterday by the Conservative leader in the House of Commons. Even Professor Franks, from Queen's University in Toronto, said it would take until July to get through all this information. That is truly contempt of Parliament and contempt of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418827">It was this same government who said that the Liberals were corrupt. During the 2006 election campaign, the Conservatives exceeded the electoral spending ceiling by $1.5 million. They cheated the democratic system. Am I making this up? No. The RCMP had to search the Conservatives' offices for documents. Is that the type of government Canadians need? No.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418828">People do not care a fig about what is going on in Parliament right now. They do not care whatsoever about corruption. I have more faith in Canadians than that. In the next 35 days, we will show them there is an alternative in Canada. This government told us it believed in bilingualism, but last week, on March 8, it announced that the Atlantic administrative region would be unilingual English. Is this the same government that said it would respect both of our country's official languages?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418829">The <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages</Affiliation> just told us that the government house leader has announced that he is very proud that he voted against forcing Supreme Court justices to be bilingual. That is true: it is in a newspaper, in an ad paid for by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418830">The government is saying that it does not want an election, yet it has just spent $26 million. It knows that Elections Canada cannot do anything about that. It has spent money for an election campaign before an election has been called. These things need to change in Parliament, in our democracy. This government said that senators should not vote on Parliament's bills. These are the same Conservatives who asked the senators to vote against the NDP's environment bill, Bill <Document DbId="4328110" Type="4">C-311</Document>. That bill would have helped our country's environment, but the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s unelected senators voted against it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2418831">That is outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2418832">In today's democracy, here, we have senators who are not even elected and who vote down bills introduced by elected members. My people sent me here. They voted for me. All of the members in the House of Commons were elected by the public. When the House of Commons passes a bill, the only thing the Senate can do, as has always been said, is study it to make it better, protect the regions and protect minorities. That is not what they are doing. The senators are listening to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada.</ParaText>
