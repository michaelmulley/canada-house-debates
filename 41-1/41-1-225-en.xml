Welcome to pastagate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246460">Born in Ukraine in 1930, Mr. Huculak witnessed the ravages of the Holodomor and World War II as a boy. He immigrated to Canada as a displaced person in 1948 with his family. Erast Huculak had a visionary entrepreneurial spirit as a business owner, founding and becoming president of Medical Pharmacies Group, serving long-term care facilities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246461">Mr. Huculak was dedicated to giving back to Canada and supporting the Ukrainian Canadian community. When Ukraine won her independence, he donated a building in Ottawa for the first Ukrainian embassy in Canada. He founded the Children of Chernobyl Canadian Fund and served as president of the Canadian Friends of Rukh for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246462">For his humanitarian activities and advancement of Ukrainian studies, Mr. Huculak was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Alberta and the Ukrainian Free University in Munich. He was recognized with many honours, including the Order of Canada, the Taras Shevchenko medal and the Ukraine president's medal of merit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246463">Erast Huculak's life shall be celebrated for strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of Ukrainian Canadians in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246465">Roger's 35 years of work was always solid, fair and worldly. Whether he was covering the Olympics in Barcelona, the protests at Tiananmen Square or the many elections in Canada, he carried himself with good humour and humility. His main passion though was always his family, his wife Denise and children Jade and Kai. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246466">However, that is not the full story. We have learned through leaks from CTV's Ottawa bureau that, first, Roger's colleagues believe he had the best BS detector on the Hill. Second, no matter how busy, Roger would sneak out of the office for a 45-minute workout; his colleagues loved that. Third, on his last day of work, he left a note for the CTV team that said, “Work space for rent. I am gone, but hopefully never forgotten”. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246468">Mr. Speaker, our Conservative government has launched a comprehensive plan to develop a world-class tanker safety system in Canada and in particular, off the west coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246469">We are implementing eight tanker safety measures immediately. These include increasing tanker inspections, aerial surveillance and Canadian Coast Guard systems. We are creating a tanker safety expert panel to review current systems and propose new and stronger ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246470">As we continue working on increasing trade, we are also working to protect Canada's environment. In the weeks and months ahead, we will be working closely with aboriginal communities. This is good news for Canada's energy export sector. This is good news for Alberta's energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246471">We will be ready to fill the orders that come from around the world for our energy products. There are close to 400,000 jobs in our oil sands that contribute an average of $22 billion a year to government revenues. Over the next 25 years there will be over 700,000 jobs and $3.3 trillion that will be contributed to Canada's gross domestic product. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246472">Mr. Speaker, today Chancellor George Osborne announced that the United Kingdom would be the first G8 country to hit the international target of committing 0.7% of GDP to overseas development aid. This is a proud moment for the British government, which kept its promise to meet the United Nations goal, despite internal opposition and very tough economic times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246473">The UN target to commit 0.7% of GDP to international aid was a pledge put forward by Canada's very own Lester Pearson and is a very integral part of our reaching our millennium development goals. However, the Conservative government is far from the goal, with our percentage falling closer to 0.2% after drastic cuts in last year's omnibus budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246474">Looking to tomorrow's budget, we hope that the government will be reinvesting funds for life-saving development aid and join the United Kingdom as a leader on the world stage in our long-lasting commitment to the world's poorest of poor. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246478">Mr. Speaker, the Semaine internationale de la Francophonie is an opportunity to remember that Canada has a noticeable francophone identity from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246479">In my riding, from Smooth Rock Falls to Hearst, and in Dubreuilville, the majority of the population is French-speaking, and the local culture reflects their identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246480">This government's decisions disregard the identity of francophones, as if they were not important at all. From the appointment of a unilingual Auditor General to budget cuts that are forcing French-speaking public servants to work in English, it is now clear that the Conservatives are not complying with the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246481">For public servants, working in French is a right guaranteed under part V of the act. This right is claimed not only by francophones in Quebec, but by all francophones across the country. Canada is made up of a vast number of communities where the francophone culture is quite present, even from Espanola to Manitouwadge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246482">Diversity makes us stronger, but with it come obligations that stem from rights we must respect. Let us celebrate our language and culture with pride. Happy Semaine de la Francophonie to all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246483">Mr. Speaker, the NDP leader's statement in Washington that the Keystone XL pipeline would mean a 40,000-person job loss for Canadians is ridiculous and false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246484">This pipeline is a key instrument to ensuring strong Canada-U.S. relations, future economic growth and jobs on both sides of the border. In Canada alone, the Keystone and other pipeline projects will mean at least 905,000 new jobs by 2035. It also means $1.3 trillion of economic output and $281 billion in tax revenue. That is a lot of schools, a lot of hospitals and a lot of roads in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246485">Not only does the NDP want to discourage one of the biggest economic projects in Canada's history, it also wants to replace it with a $21 billion job-killing carbon tax that would cost thousands of Canadian jobs. Truly, the NDP is not fit to govern.</ParaText>

While he was down there, he made it a priority to sit down for dinner at a posh downtown hotel to take up the cause of a man convicted of shooting a front-line Chicago police officer, not once, not twice, but three times. That heinous and violent attack left police officer Terrence Knox paralyzed until his recent death.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246494">Seasonal businesses are facing an unprecedented situation. Many will lose a significant number of skilled employees with specific expertise. Why will they lose these people? Because the minister is forcing them to take work that is 100 km away from their homes for 70% of their salaries.</ParaText>

In the last five years, he has increased the federal debt by $125 billion, leaving the largest deficit in Canadian history, but it gets worse. Yesterday we learned that the minister directed his staff to secretly call individual private banks about mortgage rates. Rather than trying to balance the books on the back of a napkin, they refuse to create clear rules for the financial sector and to protect Canadian consumers. Now even the finance minister's own cabinet colleague is disavowing his reckless interference in the free market. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246766">Mr. Speaker, although it is always a privilege to speak in the House, today it is with a heavy heart that I rise to debate our NDP opposition day motion on science and scientific freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246767">Before moving to the motion, I would like to clarify that we use the term “science” in the broadest possible sense, encompassing the natural sciences, technology, engineering and math, the so-called STEM disciplines, as well as the social sciences and humanities. By science, we mean all forms of intellectual endeavour whereby truth is sought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246768">Our motion has three main points. The first is for all MPs to support the basic principle that federal scientists must be enabled to openly discuss their findings with the public. Second is also a fundamental principle that public science, basic research and the free and open exchange of scientific information are essential to evidence-based policy-making. The third point is a specific request that the federal government maintain support for basic scientific capacity across Canada, including immediately extending funding to the world-renowned Experimental Lakes Area research facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246769">To begin I will talk about our first principle, which we are asking the House to vote in support of tonight. This concerns allowing scientists to discuss their findings, a practice that sits at the very heart of what for centuries has been called the scientific method.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246770">Science is not test tubes or data sets or microscopes or space stations, but a method by which we explore and attempt to explain our world. Central to the scientific method is the public disclosure of data and test results. This is crucial as it allows others to replicate research and retest and re-examine how and why scientists reached their conclusions. Without a strict adherence to the scientific method, we do not generate science but mere propaganda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246771"> Our motion asks that the House recognize that we in this place support a critical component of the scientific method, namely that researchers employed by the Canadian government not be restricted in their ability to share their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246772">I was shocked to recently discover that during an interview on #FAQMP, the <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State (Science and Technology)</Affiliation> actually bragged about getting daily briefings to ascertain whether “some scientist leaked information to another country”. Is this what we have come to? Does the government live in such fear of our top researchers that it requires daily briefings as to whether our scientists are traitors? We ask government members to vote “yes” to our motion to prove otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246773">The second point concerns public science for Canadians. Our second principle concerns ensuring government policy is based on the best available research, and that this research is made available to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246774">Canadians support science through their tax dollars. However, by suppressing the results of public research, Conservatives either seem to think that Canadian taxpayers are incapable of understanding the science being done on their behalf or think it is too dangerous to allow them to be informed and make decisions for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246775">I would also like to mention at this point that I will be splitting my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246776">Despite their disdain for science, hopefully the members on the government side of the House can see how important it is that our policies, including those connected to the economy and the environment, be based on solid evidence and not ideology. It is hard for scientists to take comfort in platitudes from members opposite. They hear the same talking points about how the Conservative government values scientific research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246777">Canadian scientists know full well that the voices of their colleagues are being silenced. Canadian scientists know that our international partners are now choosing not to collaborate with us because they question the integrity of Canadian science and fear government interference with their work. Canadian scientists also know that promising young students are being turned away because funding for scholarships and research labs is being drastically cut. Canadian scientists know that labs across Canada must now scramble to secure emergency funding and finding none, wait for an eleventh hour pardon for the crime of believing that furthering knowledge is worthy of their life's effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246778">Finally, our NDP opposition day motion calls on the Conservatives to concretely demonstrate their commitment to discovery by ensuring long-term stable funding for basic research, starting with the extension of funds to the Experimental Lakes Area. In the grand scheme of things, the few hundred thousand dollars it takes to keep the ELA open is a pittance, both in real numbers, when compared to many other government schemes and policies, and in relative terms, recognizing how much Canadians and indeed the whole world has benefited from the work being done there.</ParaText>

Canada committed 1.8% of our gross domestic product to research and development in 2010, down from our 2.1% commitment in 2001.

What happens in the hallways is that people have ideas and data. They are 80% sure they understand what is going on and they share their ideas among their colleagues, who push, pull, squeeze and test the ideas. Then after those conversations, they may be 90% sure or perhaps 0% sure because someone shot down their idea. That 90% then becomes 95% and people keep talking. That is how scientific ideas are tested, hardened and refined.</ParaText>

This is a crucial issue because public science has direct implications for the air we breath, the water we drink and the environment around us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246803">Again this week, the <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State for Science and Technology</Affiliation> boasted that the Canadian government had never invested so much in science. However, he forgot to mention that his government blindly made cuts to the industrial research tax credit program. By reducing the tax credit provided by the scientific research and experimental development tax incentive program, the Conservatives are trying to save $500 million at the expense of entrepreneurs and people working in innovative companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246804">The <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State for Science and Technology</Affiliation> also forgot to mention that it is his government that made cuts to basic research and a dozen or so research programs at Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Library and Archives Canada, National Research Council Canada, Statistics Canada, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the National Council of Welfare and the First Nations Statistical Institute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246805">We should also remember that it was this government that eliminated the research tools and instruments grants program, put a moratorium on the major resources support program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, cut funding for the PEARL research station in the high Arctic, cut the centres of excellence budget by 17% and made the irresponsible decision to abolish funding for the experimental lakes program, a world-renowned research program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246806"> But the most telling statistic is gross domestic expenditures on research and development—an important indicator of research and development performed in Canada—which has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years under this government. In 2011, gross spending on research and development represented 1.74% of GDP, a significant reduction from 2.09% in 2001. </ParaText>

The EU framework program, France and Germany are all increasing their basic research envelope. He added that Germany is increasing funding for basic research by 5% and that European countries can do targeted recruitment and they are making spectacular offers. That is his main concern.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246817">On the one hand, the focus of research is controlled more and more by the government. Basic research that satisfies scientific curiosity is no longer valued. However, what the Conservatives do not understand is that basic research often leads to our greatest discoveries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246818">On the other hand, the government has tried to restrict scientists' freedom of speech in a number of ways: they cannot attend scientific conferences; they are not allowed to speak directly to specialized journalists; and certain studies that could contradict the policies and ideology of the Conservative government are not published.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246819">I have come up with some particularly absurd examples of government censorship. Scientist Scott Dallimore was told that the minister's office had to approve his message before he spoke to the media. His research was about flooding that occurred in northern Canada 13,000 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246820">I have another example of this government's paranoia. An <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> journalist called the National Research Council to obtain information about a Canada-U.S. study on the geometry of snowflakes. It only took him 15 minutes to contact a NASA scientist, but the NRC response was late and provided only after 11 officials exchanged 50 emails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246821">The Conservative government's attitude towards its scientists is problematic in many ways. Taxpayers have paid for these studies and therefore it seems only right that they be published and promoted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246822">Censorship affects democracy. Public policies must be based on science, not ideological prejudices. With its reign of terror, the Conservative government is trying to silence scientists who could contradict it. That is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246823">Furthermore, Canada's ability to innovate relies on the rapid and open dissemination of the results of scientific and technical research. Knowledge is acquired from the experiments conducted. It can be compared to the construction of a house: it is built brick by brick, fact by fact. If the government holds back information, science does not advance as quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246824">In closing, I would like to say a few words about one of these programs—the Experimental Lakes Area program—which is mentioned in the third part of today's motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246825">In the previous budget, the Conservative government announced that it would stop funding the Experimental Lakes Area program at the end of the month. The cancellation of this program by the Conservatives marks the end of 44 years of continuous research to improve fisheries and water quality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246826">New buyers have expressed an interest in the site, but the Conservatives are already dismantling the Experimental Lakes Area research facility, which will make transferring the site to a new operator much more difficult. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246827">Our hopes that the open-air laboratory would remain under federal management were dashed, but will the Conservative government at the very least not sabotage the program so that the site can retain its scientific value in the long term?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246828">I hope that the Conservative government will use the 2013 budget it is introducing tomorrow to fix its mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246829">The government must invest more in Canada's research capacity. It must stop firing and harassing federal scientists, and it must provide better support for companies that want to invest in research and development in Canada. Thousands of good jobs depend on that investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246830">In closing, I believe that we must leave future generations a legacy instead of the huge environmental debt that the Conservatives are running up.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Hon. Gary Goodyear (Minister of State (Science and Technology) (Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246847">Mr. Speaker, we could spend the day sending barbs back and forth. I could remind the member that just a couple of weeks ago, Fraunhofer announced that it would partner with the University of Western Ontario. We could also tell the member opposite that this idea about using federal funding as awards to stimulate research in areas of critical importance is very common around the world and has worked extremely well at meeting the needs and the challenges that societies face around the world. This is not in lieu of anything else. It is an idea that we consider to boost our scientific outputs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246848">It does, however, give me great opportunity to highlight the approach of the Government of Canada to supporting science and technology, which has been a major priority of our government since coming to office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246849">In 2007 the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> launched the science and technology strategy, a multi-year strategy, and since then we have made great strides and significant investments to strengthen Canada's advantages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246850"> We are quickly establishing Canada's leadership in many scientific fields. For example, last February, a Canadian team, led by the TRIUMF physics lab in Vancouver, announced the promising news that it had developed a method of making the next generation medical isotope in existing cyclotron. What this means is that we will no longer need to use nuclear reactors. In coming years, this advancement will help hospitals, save time and money and reduce patient wait times and improve treatment protocols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246851">A few months later, in April, a Canadian scientific team was part of the groundbreaking study that revealed ten distinct types of breast cancer. This discovery promises to make diagnoses more precise and ultimately allow for more effective treatments. We are very proud of saying yes and voting to fund these types of initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246852">In June researchers at the University of Montreal published their development of a new approach to visualize how proteins actually assemble themselves in a chemical reaction. This could lead to not only a much better understanding of diseases such Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, but it could have wider implications on how the world looks at things such as biomedical basic science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246853">In September researchers at the University of Waterloo's Institute for Quantum Computing participated in a groundbreaking experiment that even I find hard to believe. They teleported a particle over a distance of 143 kilometres. This is actually the farthest distance of teleportation that ever happened on this planet. This institute is part of a global effort to develop quantum Internet, which again will be Canadians behind changing the way we do business on the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246854">Promising advancements are also emerging from Canadian involvement in pure science at CERN, the European Nuclear Research Organisation. Canadian researchers, funded in part by this federal government, were partners in this year's great discoveries, like measuring the intrinsic properties of antimatter atoms and identifying the elusive Higgs boson, an elementary particle in the standard model of particle physics, sufficiently well known to have entered popular culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246855">Another significant event that Canadian researchers were involved in that took place in Ottawa just last fall and again funded by the federal government's dollars, was the National Research Council's achievement, which I believe is a major milestone for aviation. In fact, a civil jet powered by 100% unblended biofuel was flown. This is a historic flight that symbolizes a significant step, not only for the aerospace industry but also for the advancement of sustainable sources of renewable energy. That is exactly why, on my side of the House, we vote yes to funding science and technology at every chance we are given. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246856">Our celebrated astronaut, a personal friend of mine, Chris Hadfield, is currently serving as the first Canadian Commander of the International Space Station. We have been delighted for months with his engaging tweets, his humour, his incredible photographs of earth from the International Space Station. In fact, his communications have become almost more popular than the President of the Treasury Board's, if I can send a little humour out there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246857">These are just a few examples of only the research that made it to the headlines last year. We can take pride in these achievements and we definitely do that, not only as Canadians and members of Parliament, but as members of the global scientific community. That is because science knows no borders. It benefits everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246858">We know that science has to keep up with the frontiers and the challenges that face the globe and our nations. That is why we are focusing on such priorities as the Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg, the Bayfield Institute in Burlington and cleaning up Lake Winnipeg and Lake Simcoe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246859">I would remind members of the House that just a few years ago, in the midst the worst global economic downtown since the Great Depression, governments around the world were facing very difficult choices, not only for us in Canada, but countries all over the world. They continue to do so in many instances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246860">We have seen difficult cuts to science and technology spending from many of our peer nations, cuts that have cost scientists and professors in nations, such as England, the United States and many others. In contrast, in Canada, our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took an entirely different approach. We chose to invest in science and technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246861">The opposition, commonly known in the House as the no discovery party, voted against each and every one of the budgets that contained more funding for research. Now the New Democrats are standing wanting us to support an endeavour that they voted against in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246862">We have made historic investments in science infrastructure, ensuring that our scientists have state of the art laboratories and equipment. Through the knowledge infrastructure program, we invested $2 billion in more than 500 post-secondary research infrastructure projects all across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246863">We did this when jobs were needed the most, but the NDP voted against this $2 billion, which went on to be leveraged by the provinces, the private sectors and the institutions to total over $5 billion. These are good quality jobs for our construction sector when they need it most and laboratories and research capacities for our scientists today and tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246864">We know that investments in science and technology and innovation create those high-quality and value-added jobs. They grow our economy and are fundamental to the long-term prosperity of the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246865">However, the opposition rejects science when it is not convenient. For example, the NDP leader recently went to the United States and attacked the Keystone XL pipeline, when science has said it is supportable. The New Democrats attack it when it is not convenient for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246866">We continue to strengthen research infrastructure through organizations such as the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. Over the years, we have given them over $1 billion to put state-of-the-art equipment into their new laboratories and facilities. Of course, the NDP voted against that as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246867">I would like to mention for the NDP that the $2 billion in the knowledge infrastructure program was a stimulus project. It was for two years and it ended. The member takes that information, twists it and suggests that it has been cut. It was a temporary program. The definition of temporary is that it comes and we bump up the expenditure. When it ends, and it has done its job remarkably well, that expenditure is not in the funding. However, the NDP twists those facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246868">One fact that the New Democrats continue to ignore is that since 2006, when this government came to office, we have increased science and technology by $8 billion in new dollars. We have made significant investments in basic science and scientific research at colleges and universities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246869">Do not just listen to me. The OECD has said that Canada ranks at the top of the G7 in higher education expenditures on R and D as expressed as a percentage of our GDP. Our government is committed to building on these significant achievements. One of the ways we are doing that is through government programs that connect Canadian researchers and institutions to the international community to strengthen Canada's world-class research talent and reputation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246870">We have programs such as the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships, the Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships and the Canadian Excellence Research Chairs program that ensure that the brightest minds on the planet want to come to Canada, the brightest minds who are already here want to stay here and we have the ability to train the next generation brightest minds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246871">The Canada Excellence Research Chairs is a $10 million program over seven years. It is the most generous program on the planet. That is exactly why we have a brain gain in the country, despite what one might hear from the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246872">We are delivering programs that enhance collaboration as well among the private and public sectors, programs such as the Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and Research, the College and Community Innovation Program, Business-Led Networks of Centres of Excellence and the Industrial Research and Development Internships program. These build industry and academic connections that lead to new products and new processes that will lead to new and better jobs and economic strength. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246873">Our efforts are clearly making a difference. In a highly competitive global environment, where innovation cannot lag behind and collaboration matters more each day, we cannot stay constantly with what we have done in the past, but must look to the future and organize our scientific endeavours with that in mind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246874">Perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> can take notes on this fact and share some of the following scientific facts on his next field trip outside Canada, rather than propaganda that costs Canadians jobs and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246875"> Last fall, the Council of Canadian Academies, an independent study group, released a report showing that Canadian science and technology was healthy. It is growing and it is recognized around the globe for its excellence, not in Canada or outside Canada by the NDP, but by the top scientific researchers around the world. They ranked Canada's science and technology as fourth in the world, only behind the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. It was not fourth as a percentage of our population or as a percentage of our GDP, but in absolute terms. They also said that with less than 0.5% of the globe's population, Canada produced more than 4% of the globe's scientific papers and nearly 5% of the world's most frequently cited papers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246876"> Canada clearly is punching above its weight in scientific expertise. Our reputation is helping to further strengthen that and our position and we do not expect or desire to lose that momentum. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246877">Canada has become a powerful magnet for high-quality researchers from abroad. We are pleased that researchers come to Canada to do their work and our researchers go to their nations. That is part of the ongoing ebb and tide of international scientific co-operation. We do not just force our scientists to stay here, we share them with the rest of the world and the rest of the world shares theirs with us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246878">That is why we will see a change of scientific numbers in Canada, but the bottom line is, as pointed out by many of the researchers, Canada has become a powerful magnet for high-quality researchers from around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246879">Unlike the opposition, our government is extremely proud of the world-class work that our scientists and researchers do. We value and support the important work they do every day. We rely on the critical knowledge that they produce to help us form public policy and meet the needs of Canadians, not just today, not necessarily yesterday, and certainly tomorrow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246880">Our government employs and supports scientists and researchers in countless capacities. In 2011-12 alone more than 20,000 scientific and professorial personnel worked for the federal government, including some 7,000 engaged in research and development.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246881">The exemplary work of these individuals helps us achieve key social goals, such as improving public health, ensuring safety of foods and products, building strong and vibrant economies all across the nation and ensuring a clean and healthy environment for future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246882">As a government, we understand that for these benefits to be fully realized, research findings must be effectively communicated and shared with Canadians. On federal science, as with all matters, the government's policy is to provide the public with clear and objective information about policies, programs and services, and there are many avenues through which this can happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246883">For example, each year scientists at federal departments and agencies produce thousands of peer-reviewed articles, research reports and data sets that are available to other scientists, to Canadians and to other scientific communities around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246884">For example, Environment Canada participated in more than 1,300 media interviews. In 2010, its scientists published 524 peer-reviewed journal articles. In 2012, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada issued 1,142 peer-reviewed scientific publications and 711 non-peer-reviewed publications. In 2010, NRCan published 487 scientific publications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246885">These are just a few of the numerous departments and agencies that actively share their research. The numbers show that this government not only stands behind its scientists and supports them in their work but also makes the data they generate available to Canadians and makes more data available to Canadians than ever before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246886">In recent years the government has also unveiled new measures to increase Canadians' access to federally funded scientific data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246887">For example, in 2012 the government enacted changes providing Canadians free access to Statistics Canada's main socio-economic database, CANSIM. Another example is the government's action plan on open government, led by the President of the Treasury Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246888">Open government is based on three core initiatives: open data, open information and open dialogue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246889"> Open data is about offering government data in a useful format. It allows citizens, the private sector and non-governmental organizations to leverage government data in innovative new ways. Open information is about proactively releasing information on government activities to Canadians on an ongoing basis. Open dialogue is about giving Canadians in an online community a stronger say in the development of government policies and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246890">Through this initiative, the federal government launched its open data portal, a one-stop shop for federal government data that can be downloaded free of charge by Canadian citizens, researchers, voluntary organizations, private sector business, and the list goes on and on. In fact, the portal features thousands of government data sets now freely available to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246891">We have also put in place initiatives to share federal scientific knowledge directly with Canadians. That can be found at the website science.gc.ca. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246892">These communication initiatives play an important role in our government's science and technology strategy, and it is through this strategy that we have redefined the way governments, business people and the research community band together and work together to drive economic activity through science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246893">We are working to bring the private, public and academic sectors together for the benefit of all Canadians. Why? It is because, as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has often said, science powers commerce. By moving this data out of our laboratories onto our factory floors and out to the living rooms and hospitals of the world, we will not only achieve more jobs and economic growth here, and a better quality of life, but we will also help people around the world do exactly the same thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246899">The minister's colleague, the present <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, was then the Minister of the Environment. Apparently a leak occurred in Environment Canada, according to the minister, who then summarily dispatched the RCMP to arrest a clerk who was responsible for clippings in the morning at the Department of the Environment. The clerk was led out in handcuffs in front of over 200 employees at a science-based department called Environment Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246900">Let us take this theme of environment and give this recount for Canadians: the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, gone; Sustainable Development Technology Canada, barely surviving; foundation for climate change research, eliminated; 700 and then 200 more positions announced at Environment Canada to be eliminated; the Global Environment Monitoring System, a UN partnership of decades, gone; Office of the National Science Advisor, gone; Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory, PEARL, gone; the Experimental Lakes Area, gone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246925">Scientists work for a better tomorrow through exciting discoveries, from aerospace to astronomy and from biotechnology to nanotechnology. Science matters more than ever before because the challenges we face, climate change, shrinking biodiversity, are greater and the potential benefits are larger. Canada therefore needs robust science for the public good—for example, to identify risks to ecosystems and human health and to develop solutions to reduce dangers and protect the health and safety of Canadians and the communities in which we live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246926">Tragically, science is under persistent attack in Canada, despite the fact that the benefits of university research and development are $15 billion and 150,000 to 200,000 person-years of employment per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246927">In 2008, an editorial in the prestigious journal <I>Nature</I> criticized the Conservative government for closing the Office of the National Science Advisor, skepticism about the science of climate change, and silencing federal researchers. Budget 2009 cut $148 million over three years from the federal research granting councils. Moreover, the government attempted to direct research towards subjects it perceived as priorities. Scholarships were to be focused on business-related degrees. This was a flawed strategy, as no one can predict with any certainty what the most important inventions and technologies will be in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246928">As one of Canada's Nobel laureates, John Polanyi, wrote, “We have struggled for a long time to come to terms with the fact that our universities serve the public interest best when free of government interference in academic affairs.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246929">The reality is that countries that maintain and increase their investments in research and development during difficult economic times emerge stronger and more competitive when the recovery begins. In 2009, James Turk, the executive director of Canadian Association of University Teachers, warned that lack of funding and increasing government micromanagement means we could lose a lot of our top researchers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246930">James Drummond, the chief scientist at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory, in <I>Eureka</I>, explained that he would be able to improve the lab through new infrastructure funding but would not be able to operate it. On April 30, 2012, PEARL was scheduled to cease full-time, year-round operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246931">In addition to government cuts to research funding, cuts to federal science programs and scientists, there have been new media protocols for government scientists since the Conservatives came to power in 2006. For example, Canadian journalists have documented numerous cases, from an unexplained virus in salmon, to a two-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures being possibly unavoidable by 2100, to a 13,000-year-old flood in northern Canada, in which prominent researchers have been prevented from discussing peer-reviewed articles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246932">Researchers would once have responded quickly to journalists, but are now required to direct inquiries to a media relations office which requires written questions in advance and that still might not allow scientists to speak. Federal scientists are under growing surveillance and control. Numerous studies have shown a pattern of suppression, manipulation and a distortion of federal science. Officials have limited public access to scientific information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246933">Recently a symposium called "Unmuzzling Government Scientists: How to Re-Open the Discourse" was held at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in Vancouver. The government's media policies were once again under scrutiny. According to the journal, <I>Nature</I>, “The way forward is clear: it is time for the Canadian government to set its scientists free”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246934">I can attest not only to the muzzling but also to the fear on the part of scientists. I used to consult for Environment Canada, and I have numerous friends who are scientists across Canada and the United States. Because of fear of retribution if they speak out, Canadian scientists often ask me to speak to American colleagues, who can freely comment on what is happening in Canada. I have one friend who was so concerned that he or she wrote to me from the spouse's email account to my old university email account, and then explained that he or she would call on the spouse's cellphone from a busy mall so the call could not be traced.</ParaText>

Surely everyone should be outraged by the quashing of dissenting opinions, by the war on democracy, environment and science. The persistent attack on science for the public good reached a boiling point on July 10, 2012, when Canadian scientists rallied on Parliament Hill in order to protest the closure of federal science programs, the muzzling of scientists and the “untimely death of scientific evidence and evidence-based decision-making in Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246936">At the end of the month, Canada's world-renowned Experimental Lakes Area, with 58 lakes and considered to be one of Canada's most important aquatic research facilities, will shut down. In fact, the government has already begun dismantling the station. In the space of a few weeks, 11,000 Canadians signed a public petition, sent hundreds of letters of support for the ELA to government officials and held rallies across the country. Leading scientists from around the world and across Canada support ELA's cause. Opposition members of Parliament have delivered petition after petition and undertaken press conferences, including one to push the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> to adopt the 58 lake facility. Liberal MPs held briefings for all members of Parliament and senators and put forth motions to study the value of the ELA and the potential effects of transferring the facility to a third party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246937">Following the presentation of two Liberal motions regarding the ELA, in both the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, the issue was addressed in camera without public explanation, and the motions are now no longer before the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246938">The Canadian public supports the ELA. An Environics Research poll showed that over 73% of Canadians oppose the decision to cancel federal funding for the ELA, including 60% of those identifying as Conservative voters. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans claims it cannot find the $2 million per year required to run the ELA, although it would require $50 million to remediate the lakes in the area upon the centre's closing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246939">Scientists suggest the Conservatives are trying to silence a source of inconvenient data. As a first example, PEARL, the Polar Environmental Atmospheric Research Lab, which gathered atmospheric information related to air quality, climate change and ozone required only $1.5 million to permit its year-round science program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246940">Also potentially on the chopping block is one of Canada's oldest and most celebrated scientific research stations, the 50-year-old Kluane Lake Research Station, located in the Yukon adjacent to the largest non-polar icefield in the world. The sensitive region is ideal to measure climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246941">ELA has been compared to the Hubble telescope for its service in aiding scientific research. The research conducted at the ELA must continue. The research must be made public and ELA must be owned by the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246942">In closing, we must fight for a government that understands that scientific research is fundamental to meeting Canada's needs, will restore science to its rightful place, will back promises with action and money, and will protect scientific findings from being altered, distorted or suppressed. All Conservative cabinet ministers should stand up for science, for scientists, for unmuzzling researchers, and for ensuring a scientific integrity policy so Canadians can receive the best cutting-edge science to ensure evidence-based decision-making. The government must protect our water now and for our future generations, and not protect navigation as it did in Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>.

              <ParaText id="3246956">On this side of the House, we fully understand the importance of having proper research and science in place in order to produce the best public policies for the benefit of all Canadians. Unfortunately, we have a government that does not believe in science. In fact, it is worse than that. We have a government that has launched an attack on science in this country. It has closed or cut funding to some of the best scientific research centres in Canada and has muzzled our scientists. This is absolutely unacceptable. Canadians have the right to know the results of our scientific research that is funded by tax dollars. However, we have seen many federal department crack down on what their scientists are allowed to say in public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246957">We know DFO's new communication policy: Crack down hard on scientists. All interview requests are now forwarded to the minister's office, and they are routinely denied. This is truly hard to believe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246958">Within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, many research centres have been negatively affected by the Conservative government. This department is in constant need of more science dollars for the survival of our many economically important fisheries throughout the country and for the survival of our oceans, lakes and rivers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246959">However, rather than ensure proper science funding for DFO, the Conservative government has slashed funding for many of its important research stations. These stations include the Institute of Ocean Sciences, the Freshwater Institute, the Kluane Lake Research Station, the Maurice Lamontagne Institute, the Gulf Fisheries Centre, the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, the St. Andrews Biological Station and the Experimental Lakes Area, one of the most important research areas in the country. This is only for DFO. Many more harmful scientific cuts have been made in other federal departments and programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246960">The closure I want to focus on, and the one that I believe is perhaps the best example of the government's shameful attack on science, is the Experimental Lakes Area, or the ELA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246961">The ELA is one of the world's most renowned facilities for freshwater research. It is one of a kind and has produced a lot of critical information and policy over the last 40 years. Last spring, the government announced that it would be ending the operation of the ELA. Later the government stated that it would try to find a new operator by March 31, 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246962">This facility is located in northwestern Ontario. It includes 58 small lakes and is managed through a joint agreement between the Canadian and Ontario governments. It is truly a living natural laboratory for freshwater research, and it is the only place in Canada where whole-lake ecosystem research can take place. In fact, it is the only place in the world where this type of research can take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246963">The ELA has been critical in developing evidence-based environmental policy, regulations and legislation, including regulations to control phosphorus in the Great Lakes. ELA research led to Canada becoming the first country to ban phosphorus from laundry detergents. Other research led to legislation to curb acid rain production and demonstrated that reducing mercury emissions from burning fossil fuels will rapidly lower mercury levels in fish. Ongoing research evaluates nitrogen removal from municipal waste water and the effects many household products could have on our freshwater. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246964">Information produced at the ELA is also used by researchers across the country and around the world to investigate how climate change will affect Canada's aquatic resources. Research at the ELA also provides the scientific evidence required to manage commercial and recreational fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246965"> The fact that we can now conduct responsible monitoring in the oil sands is a direct result of invaluable research done at the ELA.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246966">First nations chiefs in Ontario and Manitoba have called upon the Conservative government to reverse its decision to terminate the ELA. Four former regional director generals of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have spoken out against this closure. Liberal members of Parliament have been actively fighting the closure and are working with the Coalition to Save ELA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246967">Last October I introduced a motion for the fisheries committee to study the ELA, the research done at the facility, its impacts on public policy and the potential consequences of closing, remediating or transferring the ELA to a third party. I know that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170334" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation> did the same in the environment committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246968">The ELA costs the federal government $2 million or less to operate per year. In fact, we are hearing that the ELA could keep going for as little as $600,000. However, closing the facility entirely could cost up to $50 million. The government is now saying that the cost of closing the facility could be as low as $8 million, but we well know that it is going to be a lot of millions. Either way, it seems that the priorities of the government are severely misguided. For the cost of shutting down the ELA, the government could keep it open, and Canadians, in fact the entire world, could benefit from its research for years to come, perhaps even decades to come. However, the government would rather close up shop than keep this scientific research alive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246969">In fact, even though March 31 of this year was the date given for the government to find a new operator, we now know that the destruction of the buildings on the site has already begun. It was also reported that scientists have been told to remove their belongings in preparation for the demolition of the site. There were rumours that the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the IISD, the Winnipeg-based United Nations think tank, was the only group known to be discussing the possible takeover of the facility. The IISD was not aware of the destruction that was taking place at the ELA. This brings into serious doubt that the government is sincere that it will actually transfer the facility to a new operator.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246970"> It is certainly my fear, and the fear of all members on this side of the House, that it is not its intention at all. It is my fear that the research produced by the ELA does not go along with the government's agenda, and it has decided to shut it down, no matter what it costs. Canadians will be the ones who bear the cost of the closure of this facility, not only for the millions of dollars it would take to shut the facility down and clean up the site but also for the loss of all the possible research and policy the ELA could have produced for decades into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246971">For a country like ours, where nature is such an iconic symbol, to lose one of our most important natural research facilities is beyond belief. It is a black eye on the country, along with many other policies of the government. It has severely damaged our reputation on the international stage. The government repeatedly says that it is closing the ELA because it no longer fits the core mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. I find this excuse completely unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246972">I hope that government members will look at what is, in fact, taking place: the destruction of the scientific community across Canada, the muzzling of scientists, and their making sure that we do not have the best possible scientific advice to put policy in place for this country. Again, I urge government members across the way to take a look at this, support this very important motion and save the scientific work that is so important for fisheries and other aspects across this country.</ParaText>

It points out the need to continue what we started to do on climate change, and under this government, have systematically abandoned. The Conservative government appears to want to ignore scientists who would tell us that the continued use of fossil fuels will forever change the climate and cause floods, famine, water shortages, drought, wildfires, tornados, rising seas, et cetera, which may result in millions of refugees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246975">The Conservatives have also killed Kyoto. They have decided that Kyoto is not something worth pursuing. They have removed environmental assessments from the Canadian landscape. Even where environmental assessments remain, they do not study human health as part of their assessment process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246976">In the words of a senior scientist at the University of Victoria: “I suspect the federal government would prefer that its scientists don't discuss research that points out just how serious the climate change challenge is”. That is in regard to the muzzling of scientists, as the member referred to earlier. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246990">Today's debate is vital. The current ecological and economic crisis is a reminder that Canada needs to invest in public science and basic research and freely distribute scientific data. Climate change is real, and we are already suffering from its effects. We are at a crossroads, and we need science now more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246991">Need I remind hon. members that, just 40 years ago, our industries were polluting the St. Lawrence River, we were burning toxic waste and miners were dying of cancer because they did not have the information and protection they needed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246992">We have come a long way since then. We set up research institutes, cleaned up our lakes and rivers and decontaminated thousands of sites across the country, but there is still a lot of work to be done. Today, we are paying for the mistakes of the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246993">Right now, the situation in Canada is of grave concern. This Conservative government is undoing all the progress that we have made over the past decades. By making cuts to scientific research, censoring scientists, abolishing our environmental laws and destroying world-renowned research institutes, such as the NRTEE, the government is setting us back 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246994">The experimental lakes program is a very good example. For 40 years now, the research conducted on 58 lakes has allowed us to make extraordinary advances in the field of biology that are recognized throughout the world. For example, this research has helped us to better understand the blue-green algae phenomenon and the role of phosphates in the development of cyanobacteria. This research has helped to improve water quality in many of our lakes. And that is not all. The research on these lakes in their natural state has helped to advance scientific studies at the international level. This is the only laboratory of its kind in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246995">Yet the Conservatives do not really seem to understand the importance of this institution. Their decision to do away with the experimental lakes program is a monumental mistake. The government is saying that it will save $2 million by closing this site, yet it costs only $6,000 to operate and replacing it or getting a private institution to run it would cost several million dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246996">What is more, the Conservatives are not considering the cost of depriving our country of data that are essential to preserving the quality of our water. The Conservatives seem to think that this is no big deal, that we will stick future generations with the bill and that they will deal with the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246997">In addition, this week we learned that Fisheries and Oceans Canada had locked up the Experimental Lakes Area cabins and was preventing scientists from accessing the site. Yet Ottawa had announced that it would continue managing the site until next September, but that it would not be paying for any research after March 31.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246998">For months the government has been saying that it is looking for a private sector organization to take over the program, but nothing has happened yet. Britt Hall, a biochemist at the University of Regina and the director of the Coalition to Save ELA, is worried that 44 years' worth of data will be lost and that experiments will be cancelled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246999">Researchers at Trent University in Peterborough had to stop their work. They were working on the use of microscopic amounts of silver to prevent bacteria. It will be impossible for them to finish their research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247000">Cuts at the PEARL atmospheric research station in Nunavut also demonstrate this government's lack of a long-term vision. This winter, researchers were not able to gather data. It is important to continue funding research in areas as vital as climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247001">The list of this government's strategic errors is long: cuts to experimental farms and Mont-Joli's Maurice Lamontagne Institute, abolishing Statistics Canada's long form census, cuts to fishery research, cuts at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, at the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada's major resources support program, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247002">Thanks to documents obtained under the Access to Information Act, we recently learned that there is concern amongst Environment Canada scientists who are responsible for monitoring air quality. Many of them work in offices in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver, ensuring that we are complying with laws limiting land and atmospheric pollution. Employees are saying that the government will eliminate positions and that monitoring will be compromised. There is cause for concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247003">When the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> goes to Copenhagen, Rio or Durban and says that his government is protecting the environment, but we here in Canada see that cuts are being made to essential, basic scientific research, there is every reason to doubt the sincerity of his remarks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247004">Yet public research is essential for a developed economy such as ours. The three key players in scientific research—universities, the private sector and the government—all play a fundamental role. The government funds research through programs, institutions and tax credits. Therefore, why eliminate these incentives in science and continue to offer tax breaks to oil companies? That is a double standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247005">Public research cannot always be replaced by the private sector. Take Statistics Canada's consumer price index, for instance. Only the government can measure it, and companies really need that information.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">People often say the Conservatives are opposed to science. I think instead that they are in favour of strategic ignorance, so they can justify their inaction in certain areas that could hurt industries.

              <ParaText id="3247008">It is troubling to see that these cuts to science are accompanied by drastic changes in environmental legislation. With Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, the Conservative government drastically modified the environmental assessment process for hydrocarbons. Consultations were reduced to a minimum, almost to nothing, in fact. With Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, it took away all protection for our lakes and rivers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247009">All of this is accompanied by a culture of secrecy and censorship that has been imposed by the Conservative government since 2006. The prestigious Royal Society of Canada, an institution that has been around for more than 100 years and whose members are scientists in all fields, wrote an open letter to condemn the Conservatives' attitude. The Royal Society of Canada made a very simple request, namely, that the government stop preventing scientists from announcing their discoveries to the Canadian public. It is a fairly basic request. In a democratic society, it is important to discuss what action to take based on fact rather than simply being guided by ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247010">For instance, the census is one of the tools that enabled Canada to become one of the most developed countries in the world. It is one way for the government to develop targeted, effective public policies. For instance, it tells us what the average age is in a given area, which helps public health authorities target their actions. It guides entrepreneurs who are looking for opportunities, by mapping out the average income in a given region. It also helps community organizations that want to reach out to a specific clientele.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247011">Let us talk about the status of French, since today is the International Day of La Francophonie. The status of French in Canada is another example that proves how useful the census can be. The data collected made it possible to accurately follow major linguistic trends, thereby allowing governments to adapt their policies in order to ensure the vitality of the French language. Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could not care less. He has decided to put his own ideological interests ahead of the country's interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247012">For a government that claims to care about important issues like economic development, public health, the environment and the status of French, its attitude—tossing aside all scientific data and muzzling scientists—is not very responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247013">In my opinion, good public policies should be based on proven, credible facts. We will continue to advocate for complete freedom for all Canadian researchers and an end to this censorship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247014">I hope the Conservatives will put their shoulders to the wheel and support this important motion, so that our scientists can restore their image, regain their zeal and continue to participate in the essential research that Canada so desperately needs. Above all, I hope that we can give new hope to young Canadians who are thinking about a future in innovation, research, science and technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247035">In 2004, I went back to school to complete a BA in the pure sciences. It was a wonderful experience to submit to the rigour of scientific inquiry. My studies in agricultural and environmental sciences were a wonderful experience because of the team work and the quest for answers to our questions. It is interesting to note that when we asked a question or formulated a hypothesis, other questions surfaced. That is what science is all about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247036">Knowledge is rooted in science. When we engage in scientific inquiry or conduct experiments, we are searching for science. These studies allowed me to look at the world in a different way and to take another look at the universe, whether it was an infinitely small universe or an infinitely immense universe, in microbiology or in physics. These studies provide the opportunity to see the world in a different light. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247037">The 2011 election gave me the opportunity to become an MP and sit in Parliament. In my opinion, Parliament is a place for debate where we ask ourselves questions and look for the best solutions to the important issues brought before us. Parliament Hill and the public service employees who serve Canadians exist to help parliamentarians find the answers they need so that the laws introduced in the House of Commons are based on facts, evidence and probative data from Statistics Canada or scientific research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247038">Public research is interesting. As my colleague said earlier, research and development is carried out by universities and industries, and also by the government. That is called public research. In Canada, for a number of decades, we have been interested in various subjects. We are a Nordic country, with a particular climate. Thus, we are interested in meteorological data. In fact, Canada began establishing meteorological stations in the mid-1800s and even earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247039">These data have been collected over the years and allow us to see daily weather trends. Meteorological data allow us to see if it is time for farmers to plant or, later in the year, to harvest, or if we should be wearing a winter coat or a raincoat. When these meteorological data are collected over a number of years, they also reveal climate trends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247040">It is the same for environmental data. Environmental monitoring must take place over a number of years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247041">The beauty of public scientific research is that it provides the data needed to track trends. That is what the Experimental Lakes Area did. Since 1968, when this program was established, the region has served as a living laboratory to answer our questions about, say, lakes that were dead. What was the cause? What would fix the problem? The ELA allowed us—and will allow us, if the government wakes up and realizes the need to continue—to collect essential data. It is very important for us as parliamentarians and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247042">I would also like to point out that while I was in Vancouver, I was one of the only parliamentarians who attended the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference. I had the opportunity to meet with science professionals who denounced the muzzling of scientists, which we have already talked about. I spoke about my studies and the importance of being able to debate issues and how to address them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247043">Then, last spring, I participated in a protest against muzzling scientists. It was very exciting to see a number of scientists rise up during the protest to denounce this.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Hon. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247335">Mr. Speaker, on November 22, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="170678" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, Prince Edward Island's representative at the cabinet table, to explain the reasons her department decided that it is in the best interests of Canadians to have the document centre located in Borden-Carleton privatized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247336">The concern I raised is that privatizing the record centre, ending the relationship with the Government of Canada, which has direct control over these critical, important and private documents, could, in fact, create a problem in terms of security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247337">The termination of the Borden-Carleton centre with the Government of Canada is part of the government's attack on front-line services that are critical to Canadians, an attack that has most severely targeted Atlantic Canada as a region, and an attack by the government that is felt in every province and in a growing number of Atlantic communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247338">What the minister from P.E.I. has done is ensure that more than 70 positions will be eliminated or replaced somewhere with minimum wage jobs by workers with no affiliation with the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247339">The submissions made to CRA by Canadians often consist of documents of a highly sensitive and personal nature. Most importantly, they could be medical records. When I asked the minister to explain her actions, which will risk sensitive documents, including medical records, the minister declared that “we do not keep medical records”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247340">Actually, Canadians must submit documents on a regular basis for tax and benefits purposes. CRA files, in fact, do contain medical records. The minister was wrong. The minister confirmed that the purpose of the privatization of the Borden-Carleton facility was to do records management at a lower cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247341">How low will the Conservative government go? Is it willing to privatize to a facility paying minimum wage? Is the minister from P.E.I. willing to allow the private sector to move records off Prince Edward Island, away from the island, with the loss of those jobs as well? Does the minister not realize that paying decent wages and benefits lessens the risk to the security of the system? Citizens' records are important. To put records at risk is just not sensible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247342">On February 2, 2013, in response to a letter I sent to the <Affiliation DbId="170678" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, the minister stated that her officials had consulted the Privacy Commissioner and Justice Canada with respect to the control of these sensitive documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247343">What is interesting is that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has acknowledged that on December 12 it would be making a decision. However, according to the Union of Taxation Employees, which had called for an investigation by the Privacy Commissioner, that investigation, as of today, has not been concluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247344">The question remains: Why has the government taken this action to privatize or close this facility? Why did the minister not give us the proper information on what the Privacy Commissioner is really doing and where that investigation is at?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247345">Mr. Speaker, I am sure that we will be able to put the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>'s mind at ease in terms of a response to his question. Of course, our top priority is the economy, which includes meeting the needs of Canadians while making sure that tax dollars are spent wisely. Re-engineering the way we manage paper records to a records management service provider will ensure the privacy and security of taxpayers' records and will do so at a lower cost to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247346">Also let me clarify that the benefit programs directorate within the Canada Revenue Agency does not keep medical records. Certainly as a former medical health care practitioner, there is a significant difference. We do have documents that contain limited information related to an applicant's eligibility determination for the disability tax credit. Let me assure the hon. member that the privacy and security of taxpayer information is always our foremost consideration when it comes to making business decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247347">Our decision to find a records management service provider involved a thorough risk assessment with due consideration paid to all aspects of physical, personal and technological security. I can assure the member that privacy risks have been properly assessed and due diligence was done, including extensive consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247348">Currently, CRA is in the process of finding a records management service provider through a competitive process. The RFP has clearly identified and addressed privacy-related requirements including placing priority on keeping sensitive taxpayer information under government control and within Canadian borders. Consequently, the contractual documents require that all records processing, storage, transportation and destruction must take place in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247349">The successful bidder's facilities will be state-of-the-art, with remotely monitored alarm systems, digital closed-circuit TV systems, infrared motion detection systems and other technical safeguards such as fire detection and suppression and biometric access controls to protect the privacy and security of taxpayer information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247350">Using a records management service provider gives the agency access to ongoing technology, and process improvements will eliminate processing steps and will reduce total costs to the CRA, while ensuring the security, privacy and safety of the records.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247351">Private sector innovation and expertise offer the agency economies of scale and storage costs that are directly proportional to the storage and service used. Moving to using a records management service provider will provide the CRA with ongoing annual savings beyond 2015, while ensuring the safety, privacy and security of our records.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247352">Mr. Speaker, I just had to shake my head. Wow. Is that not great? All this technology. The government would be happy if it could just get rid of people because that is what it is basically doing. It is getting rid of the people who are doing the jobs and who are receiving reasonable incomes. The Conservatives are, regardless of what the parliamentary secretary says, risking sensitive information. Has the member never seen the information that goes on Canada pension disability applications? That is very sensitive medical information in many cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247353">The answer is quite simple. The government has not answered my question to date. Why is the minister from P.E.I. moving jobs off Prince Edward Island and trying to move government paid workers to lower minimum wage jobs? It just makes no sense in terms of our economy on the island and it makes no sense to Canadian taxpayers who deserve decent services and decent wages for the taxes they pay the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247354">Mr. Speaker, records management storage providers are currently being used by other government departments to store sensitive documents. Other jurisdictions, including the U.K., the Australian tax office and the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, have also found a managed service model to be an efficient and effective solution to improved paper records management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247355">The U.K. government procurement office recently announced it had completed a procurement that establishes an agreement to provide government-wide standardized practices and pricing for records management document storage and services delivered by four vendors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247356">By using a records management service provider, the Canada Revenue Agency will continue to provide taxpayers and benefit recipients with the high standard of service and security they expect and deserve, while doing so at the lowest possible cost for all Canadians and, most importantly, protecting the integrity of the Canadian tax system.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247357">Mr. Speaker, in early December last year, I was trying to get the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> to understand that the changes made to employment insurance and the appeal mechanisms she wants to introduce beginning this April violate the rights of unemployed workers. I was not satisfied with the answer I received, so I would like to revisit the issue here this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247358">The structure of the new the social security tribunal, commonly known as the SST, is unacceptable. The Conservatives have systematically reduced access to programs, and they are now doing the same thing with appeal mechanisms. Furthermore, instead of creating a more efficient system, they are only adding to processing times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247359">I am here to repeat my question: why discourage unemployed workers from appealing, if not to deter them from applying for the benefits to which they are entitled, or to force them to move and accept a lower wage? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247360">There are many negative aspects to the changes made to the appeal mechanism. At present, when someone's EI claim is denied, they can appeal the decision directly before a tribunal—known as the board of referees—that is made up of three people. It normally consists of a chair and two assessors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247361">Beginning in April, with the elimination of the board of referees and the tripartite system, hearings are not guaranteed and a single member of the new social security tribunal will make the decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247362">We also now know that the Conservatives save well-paying jobs for their cronies or even former candidates who were defeated. In Quebec, of all the appointments made so far, none of the new members of the social security tribunal is a former labour representative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247363">The appeal system has also been consolidated and centralized, reducing the number of members from 700 to 850 part-time and 39 full-time members to review some 27,000 cases annually across the country. How can there not be new wait times? The numbers speak for themselves, and it is absolutely disgusting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247364">Also, in the new first-level appeal system, claimants will have the right to appeal within 30 days of the decision, in writing please. They may also face a summary rejection on a paper review or at a hearing in <I>x</I> number of days. It may also be possible to extend the appeal period for special reasons, but within a maximum of one year. A review of the decision will be possible in the event of new information but, once again, within a maximum of one year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247365">At the second level, the system will go from 32 judges hearing about 2,300 cases a year, to 13 judges for all of Canada. It will be possible to appeal with permission only within 30 days. We believe that this new system will abandon the unemployed and cut them off from the employment insurance system. They will have less access to it, and our families will suffer more and more.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247366">Mr. Speaker, all Canadians have the right to fair and impartial decisions with their social security appeals, and we are not about changing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247367">Right now four different tribunals hear cases with respect to employment insurance, the Canadian pension plan and old age security. In three of the four current tribunals, each case is heard by a three-member panel chosen from among over 1,200 part-time members. These members hear appeals, on average, two days per month. This is inefficient, as we can tell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247368">A great deal of complex logistics and administrative support is required to keep these part-time members engaged and fully informed. Support staff must train these members and keep them informed of current appeal and other legal decisions that may affect cases put before tribunal members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247369">In addition, under the current system files are generated manually, resulting in a lot of cumbersome paperwork.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247370">Panel members must hear cases in person, and that means that there are significant administrative and travel expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247371">The new social security tribunal would be made up of 70 members, all working full time, appointed by order in council. In place of panels, cases would be dealt with by one member. These members would be dedicated solely to hearing and deciding on appeals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247372">Having full-time members would allow the social security tribunal's support staff to concentrate on what they should doing, that is, the appeal process itself. This would enable members to hear and render decisions more effectively. It would also significantly reduce the work that is involved in appointing, training and briefing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247373">With respect to fairness, one of the hallmarks of the current process is the independent relationships members have with the department and their impartiality. This independence would be preserved in the social security tribunal, and the importance of objectivity and neutrality would continue to be emphasized. The expertise of decision-makers would not be affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247374">The new social security tribunal would provide two levels of appeal. The first, the general division, would have two sections for appeals, one for employment insurance and the other for CPP and OAS. The second level, the appeal division, would hear all appeals from the general division. Both divisions would be dedicated to providing fair and impartial reviews of government decisions. Members would be assigned to one section, based upon their particular experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247375">As for the appeals themselves, we are going to see quite a few changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247376">First, case files would be generated electronically, eliminating heavy paperwork. Instead of appearing in person, appellants could apply to have their cases taken by phone or video conference whenever possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247377">Canadians have told us that they want less bureaucracy. They want us to cut red tape. That is exactly what we would be doing in the establishment of the new social security tribunal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247378">Mr. Speaker, I wonder who this will benefit. It certainly will not benefit unemployed workers, who used to have the right to be heard. With the new social security tribunal, they can make their case in writing. If the tribunal decides to uphold the decision, it can do so without providing any new information to the person making the appeal. The <Affiliation DbId="170869" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and to the Minister of Labour</Affiliation> talked about impartiality.

              <ParaText id="3247379">Furthermore, we know very well that there are proposed cuts in this area, quotas of $485,000. The unemployed workers will suffer the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247380">I will repeat my question for the parliamentary secretary. Why is this government so bent on punishing unemployed workers, treating them like criminals and putting their fate in the hands of failed Conservative candidates?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247385">Mr. Speaker, my intervention today follows up on the question I asked on December 4 last year about the many changes made to the Navigable Waters Protection Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247386">I would like to point out that the reform of the Navigable Waters Protection Act was never announced during the election campaign or in the Conservative government's mammoth budgets. It was a real surprise, especially since the government did not announce it during the election campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247387">Unfortunately, when I asked the <Affiliation DbId="170700" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> my question, he did not respond in any way to the concerns of Canadians about the changes to this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247388">However, my question was quite clear, simple and inspired by comments from Canadians. I travelled around the riding of Mégantic—L'Érable and the Chaudière River area to find out if the public knew about this reform. They told me that they did not know that Lac Mégantic, Rivière Chaudière, or even Rivière Saint-François, in my riding, would no longer have environmental protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247389">Following my visit, people came to see me. They could not believe that their Conservative MP did not stand up for their river or lake. Even after I got back to my riding, I received a number of calls from people who wanted to thank me and to tell me that they were angry about this situation. These are a few examples of people in the community who were not aware of this reform. They were shocked and angry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247390">When it comes to protecting navigable waters, I highly doubt that the legendary slogan that the Conservatives used to appeal to Canadians—“Our region in power”—can be applied. Instead, our slogan—“Our region abandoned by the Conservatives”—seems more fitting. The comments my colleague made earlier about employment insurance shows that this is true. The same thing is happening here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247391">In this respect, we are wondering why the Conservatives allowed the President of the Treasury Board to protect the lakes of the rich and famous in his riding and abandon the rest of Canadians. That is the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247392">I examined the whole situation carefully and there is no reasonable explanation. It is important to mention that, when asked a question in the House, my NDP colleague clearly showed that the website regarding the Navigable Waters Protection Act mentioned the word “environment” dozens of times. As soon as she mentioned this in the House—the next day, I believe—the website was completely changed with every instance of the word “environment” removed. This may have been a coincidence, but I think that it was arranged by the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247393">People are upset that the government is abandoning environmental protection. They do not understand why certain lakes and rivers are protected while others, such as Rivière Saint-François, Lac Mégantic, and Rivière Chaudière, are not. That is my question. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247394">Mr. Speaker, all of the waterways mentioned by the hon. member are protected. Environmental laws will continue to apply to all of our country's waterways, as he said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247395">The changes made to the Navigable Waters Protection Act are not environmental in nature because this is not an environmental law. This law is not environmental and it never has been; therefore, the amendments will have no impact on the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247396">The Navigable Waters Protection Act exists to reconcile conflicting interests in the case of ships and bridges, for example. It allows Canadians to have access to these waters for transportation and construction. That is the main reason this law was created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247397">Currently, the law applies to waters where navigation is questionable. Our public servants are obliged to work on projects that have nothing to do with navigation. In order to eliminate this waste and keep our economy working as it should, we changed the law to focus on navigable waters.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3247398">Happily, all of the laws protecting the environment continue to apply just as they always have. For example, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Fisheries Act and the laws on wildlife habitat will continue to apply. All of those laws will continue to protect the waterways that the member mentioned in his speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247399">The reality is that the laws on navigation will apply only to those waters that have navigation. It would seem to me that would make sense. When there is a small stream that is not capable of carrying any large-scale navigation and a farmer wants to build a small footbridge over it, I do not think it is necessary for the national transportation department to come out and make sure that a shipping vessel will not be interrupted by that footbridge. When the people at Wabamun Lake in Alberta want to build small recreational docks so their kids can fish off them, or God forbid, jump in the lake, I do not think it is necessary to have federal bureaucrats ensuring that shipping tankers will not be interrupted. We know that is not necessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247400">Navigation laws will now focus on navigation. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247401">Mr. Speaker, before getting back to the Navigable Waters Protection Act, I want to point out that my hon. colleague was saying that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the fish habitat protection provisions of the Fisheries Act could apply. However, these two pieces of legislation were targeted in Bills <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>. They were amended and the protections were reduced. In fact, the government is attacking environmental protection. Why is there a double standard in the Navigable Waters Protection Act?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247402">If my hon. colleague is saying that we do not need to protect the environment, then why is it that the Treasury Board is protecting the lakes in one riding in particular? This supposedly does not protect the environment. However, those lakes are protected when tens of thousands of other lakes and rivers in Canada are not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247403">The question needs to be asked. Why this injustice? Why is it that the Treasury Board is protecting lakes in one riding full of rich and famous people? What are we doing for all the other Canadian lakes?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247404">Mr. Speaker, I will try to explain it again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247405">Let us once again go back to the example of Wabamun Lake in Alberta. If people want to build recreational docks on that lake, they are not interrupting shipping or navigation, so we do not need bureaucrats from Ottawa or a federal department to ensure that navigation is not interrupted. Rather, if someone were trying to build something of an environmentally damaging nature on that same lake, then federal legislation protecting the environment would continue to apply. That is because the changes we are bringing to the Navigable Waters Protection Act have literally nothing to do with the environment. The environmental legislation, which is adequate and copious, will continue to be in place to protect our environment.</ParaText>
