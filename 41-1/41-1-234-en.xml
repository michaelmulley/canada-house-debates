I joined Treble Victor at its Highland Mess Dinner, which was graciously hosted by our friends at the 48th Highlanders of Canada. Treble Victor is a volunteer network of Canadian and allied veterans who have served their country with distinction and transitioned into successful careers in the private sector. The men and women of Treble Victor continue to serve our country and their comrades-in-arms. They have raised funds for military families, wounded veterans and other charities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3276799">Most importantly, Treble Victor members have helped Canadian Forces members transition out of uniform. They have also educated corporate Canada on the tremendous value of hiring veterans.</ParaText>

He was a member of the rural development association, the agriculture board, a long-time member of the Lions Club and deputy governor. He was instrumental in the construction of the Lion Max Simms Memorial Camp.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277091">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege concerning the disclosure of information contained in legislation not yet introduced in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277092">This arises from a story written by Steven Chase in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and published this afternoon at 1:36 eastern daylight time. I would like to quote portions of that article. “The...government is temporarily delaying the introduction of its electoral reform legislation following a discussion in Conservative caucus Wednesday morning”. Sources say Tory MPs, in the closed door meeting, “raised concerns” about how some sections of the bill were drafted and suggested rewrites. “Asked for comment Wednesday afternoon...the minister of state for democratic reform said the Tories found some last-minute problems with the new bill”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277093">One of the lines that I quoted implies that instead of any general briefing and discussion on the orientation of the awaited bill, the Conservative caucus may have been provided with actual text of the draft bill, which is yet to be introduced, and as such, should have remained secret.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277094">This is why, whether they are private bills or government bills, when they are being drafted, they are printed secretly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277095">It is also worth noting that the Conservative caucus may imply that some others than the Conservative parliamentarians may have had access to this. We have in our caucus non-parliamentarians who participate, and I suspect it may be the same for other caucuses as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277096">If the yet to be seen text has already been introduced specifically, this may very well constitute a serious breach of parliamentary privilege. I would like to quote the 40th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, in 2001, where such an incident had occurred.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277101">It has been reinforced many times that the normal procedure for a government bill, once placed on notice, is that the bill be kept confidential until introduced in Parliament. If what we heard is true, for a few select parliamentarians to be able to view the content of government bills prior to the rest of their colleagues in the House damages the integrity, the dignity and the authority of the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277103">The reports that appeared earlier this afternoon, at 1:07 p.m. precisely, in an article by Steven Chase of <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, do suggest that certain members of the Conservative caucus had access to the content of this new bill, which is currently on the notice paper, prior to the rest of the members of this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277104">Given the seriousness of the matter of prematurely disclosing the content of a bill, it is my duty as a member of Parliament to bring this question to the attention of the Chair and to this House at the earliest opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277105">In that article, Steven Chase said that sources say Tory MPs, in the closed door meeting, “raised concerns” about how some sections of the bill were drafted and suggested rewrites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277106">The bill being mentioned, I should emphasize, if that is not clear, is the one that has been put on the notice paper yesterday by a minister of cabinet, the <Affiliation DbId="170707" Type="4">Minister of State for Democratic Reform</Affiliation>, entitled “An act to enact the Canada political financing act and to amend the Canada Elections Act and other acts”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277107">The<I> Globe</I> article, by advancing that some MPs have expressed concerns about specific sections of the bill, clearly implies that those Conservative MPs have had access to a copy of the bill that is still on the notice paper and has yet to be introduced for first reading in this House. We will definitely need clarification on whether or not they have seen the text of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277108">The question of the premature disclosure of a bill has been raised multiple times before this House. For instance, on March 14, 2001, the member for Provencher at the time, who is now the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, rose on a question of privilege regarding a briefing the Department of Justice held for members of the media where there was discussion regarding a bill not yet introduced in the House, Bill C-15 of the 37th Parliament, while denying access of the same information to all members of Parliament.</ParaText>

However, with respect to material to be placed before parliament, the House must take precedence. Once a bill has been placed on notice, whether it has been presented in a different form to a different session of parliament has no bearing and the bill is considered a new matter. The convention of the confidentiality of bills on notice is necessary, not only so that members themselves may be well informed, but also because of the pre-eminent rule which the House plays and must play in the legislative affairs of the nation.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3277120">I would add that it is all the more serious that the interventions within the Conservative caucus resulted in it being decided that the bill would not be tabled on the day the minister said it would be. That means that they have had an earlier vantage point on the bill than we have had. Under the minister's announced scheme, we would be debating this next Wednesday in the House. If he had not been convinced to pull it back, the members of the Conservative caucus would have seen it a week in advance of any attempt by our caucus to discuss the same bill. It is not just the fact that this was looked at today and withdrawn; it is the fact that had nothing occurred and the bill had gone forward, the Conservative caucus would have had a week's advantage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277121">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my two hon. friends for raising this point, as they have done, at the earliest possible opportunity. That is one of the disadvantages they labour under. The other disadvantage is that they are asserting facts about a meeting that they did not attend and are relying on assertions from a news article written by somebody who also was not in attendance at the subject meeting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277122">I can clarify this matter fairly simply to make it clear that in the case of this caucus meeting on this particular legislation that is on notice in draft form, there were no draft copies of this legislation circulated at any caucus meeting that the Conservative Party held today. There were no draft copies displayed for anybody to review at this meeting. There were no sections of the bill on display, and there were no excerpts provided. None of what he is alleging, in fact, happened. I can assure him, with 100% certainly, notwithstanding the normal practice of not discussing what happens in caucus, that this is something that did not happen in caucus. Therefore, I feel quite comfortable discussing it here on the floor of the House for all Canadians to hear.</ParaText>

After the member for <Affiliation DbId="170455" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation> spoke, I had the opportunity to ask her a question, which was, essentially, how the government would deal with the more than $100 billion it has added to the national debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277126">Unfortunately, in the written record of <I>Hansard</I>, it says $100 million. Now, $100 million is a lot of money, but it is still 1,000 times less than the debt the government has added in the past seven years. I wanted everyone to know that the figure is over $100 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277148">Mr. Speaker, today marks an inauspicious day for the government. It is a record that no government would ever seek to have, because today breaks the all-time record for the invocation of closure, the shutting down of debate, the use and abuse of the powers, the guillotine. The Conservatives may clap for this, but Canadians will not because they have also done it at a pace exceeding the previous Liberal government, which they used to criticize.</ParaText>

The current government is doing it almost every seven sitting days of the House, five times faster than even the worst abuse of power previously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277150">Parliament exists for two fundamental reasons. Members of Parliament are elected to do two central things. The first is to speak on behalf of those we represent with all the capacity and ability that we have. The second is to hold government to account. However, how can we perform the roles that members of Parliament are meant to do if we have a government sitting in majority that consistently and without shame abuses the power that is given to it under our system? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277151">Time and again the government has to justify not only muzzling its own MPs, shutting down debate in Parliament, but ignoring the wishes and hopes of Canadians. There will be a time of judgment for the government for the abusing of the powers that were given to it under our system. The government has no shame, has no recourse and Canadians will decide its fate come the next election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277155">Our House leader has ably pointed out that this is the 31st time the Conservatives have shut down debate, and it is a very sad record in Canadian history. This time we have Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> on matrimonial real property and once again it is an example of the government unilaterally imposing its legislative agenda on first nations without allowing appropriate debate. The bill has been before the House a number of times, but on this occasion it has been barely debated in the House and it has never before made it to a parliamentary committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277156">Why does the minister not want all the members in the House to perform their duties as parliamentarians and have an honest, legitimate debate on this very important legislation?</ParaText>

During all this time, it is the aboriginal families living on reserve that pay the price of inaction. After all those hours of debate that have taken place in the last few years, we simply want to render justice to that segment of the Canadian population.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277158">Mr. Speaker, it is important for us to make note that this is now, as has been pointed out, 31 times in which the government has chosen to use time allocation to try to get legislation passed through the House of Commons. It is, indeed, unprecedented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277159"> I would look to the government House leader to respond to the question as to why his government has failed in its ability to negotiate a way in which legislation could pass through the House in a more timely fashion that would ensure that members of Parliament would be afforded the opportunity to contribute to debate, not to be constantly limited in terms of how much time they would have to spend on very important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277160">As I say, there have been 31 occasions now where the government has brought in time allocation with respect to things such as the Canadian Wheat Board, the pooled pension plan, the copyright bill, back-to-work legislation, financial systems review, budget legislation and the list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277161">The question I have for the government House leader is why the government has failed to sit down with opposition parties? Why has it not be able to negotiate in good faith a time frame that would allow for adequate debate on the many pieces of legislation that need to pass through the House?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277228"> I also have to say, because the NDP is voting against every one of these things, that right now a spouse on reserve who holds interest in the on-reserve family home can sell the home without the consent of the other spouse, and can keep all the money. Apparently the NDP thinks that is okay. The spouse who holds the interest in the family home can bar the other spouse from their own family home. Apparently the NDP thinks that is okay.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3277255">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak to the piece of legislation before us, Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document>. This bill marks the fourth attempt by the government to address a serious problem in the first nations community, a problem created by the Indian Act itself. Sadly, like the first three attempts taken by the government, it simply misses the mark.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3277256">Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> is a very simplistic attempt to rectify a very complex problem that stems from the Indian Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277257">On reserves, gender discrimination clearly exists when it comes to matrimonial real property. However, Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> will be impossible to implement for the following reasons: a lack of financial resources to support first nations governments to actually implement the law; a lack of funding for lawyers and legal advice; a lack of funding to account for limited geographic access to provincial courts; a lack of on-reserve housing; and a lack of land mass that would be necessary to give both spouses separate homes on reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277258">There are no measures in the legislation to address the systemic problem of violence that faces so many women and that leads to divorce. According to Statistics Canada, first nations women are 3.5 times more likely to be victims of violence than non-aboriginal women, and 35% of aboriginal women have already been victims of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277259">Overcrowded housing has been linked to a number of health and social problems, including higher rates of respiratory infections as well as mental health and domestic violence problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277260">In 2006, 14% of aboriginal women and girls were living in overcrowded housing—a proportion three times higher than among non-aboriginal women. On reserves, 26% of women and girls were living in overcrowded conditions, compared to 6% of those living off-reserve.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3277261">All the statistics I have just read into the record show that we have a serious problem before us. Those problems require a serious, well-thought-out solution. That is not what the Conservatives have brought before us today. They are once again fast-tracking legislation without addressing all of the relevant non-legislative problems first nations women and families have identified. They are showing that they are not interested in a fulsome discussion of this bill or any other issue affecting the indigenous peoples of this land. I am left with the strong impression that all they want is to quickly enact a bad law, just to say that they have done something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277262">The problems we are facing require a comprehensive response that is led by first nations communities first and foremost. The Conservatives did do some consulting with first nations and the Native Women's Association of Canada, but then in typical Conservative style, they ignored the results of the consultation when preparing the original legislation. As a result, both the Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations are demanding better legislation, because the consequences of passing inadequate legislation are so dire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277263">One of the basic problems with this bill is that while it removes some of the most onerous parts of previous legislative attempts, it still refuses to recognize first nations' inherent right and jurisdiction in this matter. As a result, we again have the government telling first nations how they should run their lives, their communities and their systems rather than respecting their laws, their traditions and their inherent right to self-government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277264">This is the ultimate “daddy knows best” approach taken by the government, and it does nothing to make life better for women who live on reserve. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3277265">The Assembly of First Nations determined that three broad principles were key to addressing matrimonial rights and interests on reserves: recognition of first nation jurisdiction; access to justice, dispute resolution and remedies; and addressing underlying issues, such as access to housing and economic security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277266">Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> does not take any of these three principles into account in any meaningful way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277267">My province, Quebec, is a good example of the problems this bill will create. According to lawyer David Schulze, the particularities of my province have been overlooked in Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document>. Under the Civil Code, common-law partners do not hold any rights to property, but they would under Bill S-2. For example, a first nations member would have rights to his spouse's home on the Uashat reserve, but she would not have any rights to his home in Sept-Îles, across the street.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277268">The lands covered by the most recent treaties, such as the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act, which applies to large portions of my riding, are excluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277269">Under this bill, a Naskapi would have rights to his Innu spouse's home in Schefferville, but she would have no rights to his home 80 km away in Kawawachikamach, which is part of the Category I-N lands under the CN Commercialization Act and the Northeastern Quebec Agreement.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3277270">These examples show the new problems this legislation would cause in my home province alone, and they highlight another glaring problem with the bill: the imposition of provincial law on reserve. Imposing provincial legislation on first nations without their consent is ethically lacking and practically problematic and ignores the inherent rights of first nations citizens. By taking this avenue, the Conservatives are trying to make a quick fix, the equivalent of slapping a band-aid on an injury that requires major surgery. This approach is lazy and disrespectful toward those women who they claim to seek to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277271">This proposed bill also runs afoul of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which the Conservatives finally endorsed in 2010. According to the declaration, consultation requires consent as well. While Canada has conducted some limited consultations, no consent was given by the rights holders to have provincial laws applied in their communities. Therefore, if the House passes and moves to enforce Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document>, we will be in violation of article 32 of the UN declaration, which ensures free, prior and informed consent on any matter relating to the lands or welfare of the rights holders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277272">Given the government's view of the UN declaration, I doubt that it sees that as a problem. Maybe that is why, after 14 months, we are still waiting for the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> to reply to the request of the UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Rights to study Canada.

              <ParaText id="3277273">We have a big problem before us. It will require a comprehensive approach to arrive at a solution, one that must be led by first nations communities and be respectful of their own laws and traditions. Simply forcing provincial laws that were not written with those traditions and laws in mind will only make matters worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277274">Part of the reason many first nations find themselves in this legal position today is that past governments took the “daddy knows best” approach, telling first nations how they should act, behave and govern themselves without giving any thought to their wishes, their needs, their desires or their rights. Today we know that this approach was wrong and a mistake, yet the Conservative government is determined to force us down the same failed path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277275">We cannot have true reconciliation and build that better tomorrow for all Canadians until we throw that failed approach into the trash can of history, where it belongs. We must renew a nation to nation relationship that begins with working with first nations communities, not dictating to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277276">The Conservatives obviously have a great deal to learn about this. They seem more interested in being seen to do something while doing nothing, which is something they do with great skill. Now is not the time for pretending. It is the time to act and do this correctly right now. I hope that the government will take my words to heart, agree, and start to work with us to get this right, right now.</ParaText>

However, how many of those women are living in isolated communities where there is a dearth of safe housing for anyone, including men, women and children? They cannot afford the bus fare, let alone have an available bus to go to town to hire a lawyer, let alone have the resources to hire a lawyer to fight these matters in court. Can the member speak to that and elaborate on the fact that the offer of the extension of the right is an extremely superficial one?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277290">Mr. Speaker, I am indeed pleased to speak today in support of Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document>, the family homes on reserves and matrimonial interests or rights act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277291">Let me start by affirming and stating quite clearly that it is completely unacceptable that men, women and children living on reserve have for decades been deprived of the same basic rights and protections afforded Canadians living off reserve simply because of where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277292">Through this legislation, our government is addressing a long-standing legislative gap and ensuring that women, children and families on reserve can live in safe, stable home environments. I believe that the bill offers a practical, balanced and much needed solution that I wish to insist has been informed by national consultations with stakeholders, numerous reports, in-depth analysis and reasoned debate. I say now is the time for action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277293">I cannot emphasize enough the urgency of the issues that Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> proposes to resolve. Every day that passes until a solution is in place is one more day that women and children living on reserve do not have access to the same protections offered those living off reserve. Without the rights to matrimonial real property that other Canadians enjoy, more and more individuals and families, primarily aboriginal women and children living on reserve, are left defenceless, and in many cases, homeless and destitute. They are ostracized from the only community they have ever known and are forced to start life all over again elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277294">Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> offers an effective solution that would provide individuals with the rights and protections they need to ensure that they have access to the family home no matter which spouse is listed as the owner. The effect that the absence of legislation has on the lives on many individuals and families is a compelling reason for the members of the House to acknowledge the urgency of the situation and to pass Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277295">Currently, and no one can dispute that, there is no law in place addressing matters related to on-reserve matrimonial real property and interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277296">More than 25 years ago, two Supreme Court of Canada rulings clarified that provincial laws pertaining to matrimonial real property rights and interests do not apply in first nation communities. Given that no equivalent federal law exists, these interests and rights are not protected for individuals living on reserve in the event of a breakdown of a conjugal relationship or the death of a spouse or a common-law partner. This situation is unacceptable and should make endorsing Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> a top priority for the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277297">Individuals who live off reserve have access to the protections and legal recourse set out in the provincial or territorial laws. However, individuals living in first nations communities, with few exceptions, do not benefit from such protections. No judge, police officer or court representative is authorized to intervene if someone throws his or her spouse out of the house or sells the family home and keeps all the proceeds from that sale. In other words, our justice system is not currently in a position to be able to end the harmful discrimination faced by an identifiable group of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277298">Canadians should not tolerate this fundamental injustice. The fact that this has been going on for 25 years is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277299">It is true that a small number of first nations have developed laws pertaining to matrimonial rights and interests under the First Nations Land Management Act or self-government agreements. However, these options are not currently available to most first nations. As a result, over 100,000 Canadians do not have any legal protection in this regard. This has been harmful to many people, families and communities. These injustices have a negative impact on the lives of all Canadians, without exception. The only way to move forward is to enact an effective legislative solution, which is what Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> seeks to do.</ParaText>

The committee heard from more than 30 witnesses and adopted 12 amendments to improve the bill and reflect the input and comments received from stakeholders, including first nations and provinces. That version of the bill died on the order paper with the dissolution of Parliament, it but serves as an example of how previous studies and testimony have strengthened the legislation now before us.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Ms. Linda Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3277362">Mr. Speaker, on December 5, I put a question to the <Affiliation DbId="154354" Type="96">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation> asking if her new anti-corruption measures would address any subcontracting problems or illegalities, including those related to a half-billion dollar contract with SNC-Lavalin to manage 300-plus federal buildings. The contract involved numerous subcontractors. It may be noted that she advised that these concerns about this general contractor were brought to her attention by the media, not by her own officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277363">My question was whether the new improved measures would be made retroactive to existing contracts and subcontracts and whether they are being applied and enforced by the government or by contractors. I still await an answer to those questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277364">This scenario also raises the question of how well the government is delivering its own watchdog responsibilities. It is fine to strengthen the code of conduct, but if not closely monitored and stringently enforced, it has little deterrence, let alone punishment, value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277365">The minister reiterated that her government's contractual obligations are with only the general contractor—in other words, not with the subcontractors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277366">The minister also responded that following specific allegations about the bidding process, officials brought in a private forensic auditing company, PricewaterhouseCoopers. What did this cost? Are there no compliance or audit officials within Public Works and Government Services?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277367">The audit called for increased frequency of audits of contracts and improved documentation of expenditures, including providing time sheets. These are pretty basic duties one would have expected to already be in place for a contract to spend half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money. These are pretty basic accounting and audit functions for any contract. A great concern is that these functions were not already being addressed. Are they now being better addressed in light of staff reductions? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277368">Problems with procurement can also be found within Public Works and Government Services itself. We have the case of the two-decade long dispute over federally contracted relocation services for military, RCMP and public servants. It ended in a 15-month trial, with a finding against the government. The case centred on conflict of interest allegations about Public Works and Government Services, then under a Liberal government. The contract was awarded, cancelled, re-tendered, re-awarded to the same company, reviewed by an international trade tribunal, then by a parliamentary committee, and then the Auditor General, before finally being referred to the courts. The report of the Auditor General is scathing. The case centred around yet another public works procurement pilot case to address rising costs of relocation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277369">This month, the court found the federal government at fault with a $30-million cost award. The case is noteworthy, as the government is apparently yet again receiving complaints about its latest pilot relocation procurement process from potential bidders and federal employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277370">I am advised that the latest reform may shortchange both the small moving companies and the families of service men and women. Concerns raised about the latest new, improved procurement process for relocation mirrors many of the exact concerns raised in the successful ongoing court action. This includes failure to fully disclose information necessary to submit a well documented bid. As noted by a former senior official, the government needs to understand that the key role of Public Works and Government Services is to protect the integrity of the bidding process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277371">Of concern, the judge in the Envoy case noted that the problems in the procurement process were not detected until the audit by the Auditor General. These were not findings of kickbacks, bribes, or political meddling under the code of practice. The root of the problem appeared to be the lack of scrutiny or fairness in the overall procurement process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277372">I ask the government this: What measures have they taken to address these failings, with the resulting monumental costs to taxpayers, beyond a revised code? What reassurance is there that the same failed processes will not be repeated in the 2014 renewal?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277374">As part of enhancing the integrity of the real property and procurement process, Public Works and Government Services Canada is constantly reviewing and strengthening its measures to improve integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277375">In 2007, as part of the Federal Accountability Act and the federal accountability action plan, Public Works and Government Services Canada added a code of conduct for procurement to its RFP documents. The department also added measures to render suppliers ineligible to bid on procurement contracts if they have been convicted of fraud or if they have paid a contingency fee to a person to whom the Lobbying Act applies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277376">In 2010, Public Works and Government Services Canada added an offence to its list of measures regarding integrity, thereby rendering suppliers ineligible to bid on procurement contracts if they have been convicted of corruption, collusion, bid rigging or any other anti-competitive activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277377">In July 2012, Public Works and Government Services Canada implemented additional measures to strengthen the integrity of its real property and procurement operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277378">As a result of these measures, the department is strengthening due diligence, reducing the risk of fraud and improving its ability to manage risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277379">Allow me to summarize. We have already put in place provisions allowing us to render ineligible bidders found guilty of one of the following offences: fraud against the government under the Criminal Code of Canada; fraud under the Financial Administration Act; corruption, collusion, bid rigging or any other anti-competitive activity under the Competition Act; and the payment of contingency fees to individuals covered by the Lobbying Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277380">On July 11, 2012, Public Works and Government Services Canada extended the application of integrity provisions to its real property transactions, such as leasing contracts, and added six new offences that would render suppliers ineligible to do business with the department: money laundering, involvement in organized crime, income and excise tax evasion, bribery of foreign public officials and drug trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277381">These measures came into force when announced and apply to all future PWGSC solicitations and real property transactions, which include leasing agreements, letting of space, and acquisition and disposal of crown assets. These measures will also allow the department to terminate contracts and leases with companies or individuals that are convicted before the end of their contract or lease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277382">We are very proud of the efforts made by our department to ensure accountability and integrity in the way we do business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3277388">Mr. Speaker, after the government received yet another embarrassing grade on the environment, I asked whether the <Affiliation DbId="170675" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> would do the right thing and restore funding to the Experimental Lakes Area, or ELA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277389">Let me begin by discussing the government's dismal record on the environment, followed by why the government should fund the ELA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277390">The 2008 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Canada 56th of 57 countries in terms of tackling emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277391">In 2009 and again in 2013, the Conference Board of Canada ranked Canada 15th of 17 wealthy industrial nations on environmental performance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277392">In 2010, Simon Fraser University and the David Suzuki Foundation ranked Canada 24th of 25 OECD nations on environmental performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277393">Having received such failing grades, an accountable, responsible government would have taken meaningful action to protect our fragile environment and the health and safety of Canadians, while building a vibrant green economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277394">Instead, the government gutted environmental legislation of the last 50 years through economic plans 2012 and 2013 and its draconian omnibus implementation bills, Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, severely cut the budget to Environment Canada, cancelled the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, and continues to muzzle government scientists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277395">The government's appalling environmental policies have been rightly criticized by policy makers, scientists, Canadians, the international community and repeatedly by the prestigious international science journal <I>Nature</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277396">The Conservative government once again had the opportunity to improve its negative performance by changing its reckless decision to close the world-renowned ELA, with 58 lakes, and considered to be one of Canada's most important aquatic research facilities. Instead, the government began dismantling the station at the end of last month. In the space of a few weeks, 11,000 Canadians signed a public petition, sent hundreds of letters of support for the ELA to government officials and held rallies across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277397">Leading scientists from around the world and across Canada support the ELA's cause. Liberal MPs held briefings for all members of Parliament and senators and put forth motions to study the value of the ELA and the potential effects of transferring the facility to a third party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277398">Following the presentation of two Liberal motions regarding the ELA, in both the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans the issue was addressed in camera, without public explanation, and the motions are no longer before the committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277399">Scientists suggest the Conservatives are trying to silence a source of inconvenient data regarding climate change with the closures of the Polar Environmental Atmospheric Research Lab, the ELA and with the Kluane Lake Research Station on the chopping block.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3277401">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the member opposite on the Experimental Lakes Area. The government has made its decision, as we have said many times. Fisheries and Oceans Canada will no longer operate the Experimental Lakes Area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277402">However, DFO understands that significant work has been done at the facility. As a result, the department hopes to transfer the facility to another operator that is better suited to managing it. That would ensure the facility is available to scientists, in universities or elsewhere, who would like to conduct whole lake experiments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277403">At the same time, Fisheries and Oceans Canada is focusing on scientific work being conducted at other locations across the country. The department's science program in freshwater environments is diverse. The results of this diversity of freshwater research help to ensure the sustainability of our aquatic ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277404">Let me provide a little more detail about DFO's freshwater research. One of the priority areas for freshwater research in the department is fish habitat science. That is where departmental scientists conduct research and provide science advice related to the effects of human activities on fish habitat and the productivity of commercial, recreational and aboriginal fisheries. One such example of fish habitat science is research and advice related to the impacts of hydroelectric development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277405">There are hundreds of hydroelectric facilities across the country, generating electricity for Canadians. The rising demand for energy and the growing interest in renewable energy would require additional hydroelectric facilities and increased production from the existing installations. It is essential that we understand the potential effects of hydro power on fish habitat and fisheries productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277406">At Fisheries and Oceans Canada, scientific research focuses on the potential impacts of reservoir construction and management, fish passage, and modification to river flow as they may affect fisheries productivity. The results of this kind of research improve our understanding of the potential effects of hydro power and help to inform decision-making and promote the sustainable development of hydroelectric resources in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277407">However, DFO scientists do not work in isolation. To complement the department's science program, DFO scientists collaborate with universities, other government departments, industry partners, and other science organizations. HydroNet is an excellent example. It is a collaborative national research network that aims to develop a better understanding of the effects of hydroelectric operations on aquatic ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277408"> HydroNet is part of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada's strategic network grants program and receives support from DFO. Through the network, research professionals from DFO, provincial governments, universities and industry come together to exchange ideas, expertise, data, and solutions related to sustainable hydro power and health aquatic ecosystems in Canada.This collaboration enhances scientific knowledge on the effects of hydroelectricity in support of the department's mandate and helps to leverage investments in government science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277409">I have described tonight some of the excellent work that Fisheries and Oceans Canada is doing to understand the effects of human activities on fish habitat and fisheries productivity. This is just one area of freshwater science where the department is conducting scientific research. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3277410">We will continue to make wise investments in priority science areas that directly support conservation and fisheries management and ensure sustainable aquatic ecosystems.</ParaText>
