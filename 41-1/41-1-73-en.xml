              <ParaText id="2673694">Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to open debate at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document>, the financial system review act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673695">This proposed legislation matters to Canadians because it concerns one of the most fundamental drivers of our economy, the financial services sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673696">Before I go any further I would like to note that the proposed legislation is in fact mandatory. Every five years, the government is bound to review the statutes that govern federally regulated financial institutions to maintain the safety and the soundness of the sector, while ensuring that Canada remains a global leader in financial services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673697">The Canadian Bankers Association has remarked that its members “believe strongly in the importance of ensuring that the legislative and regulatory framework is reviewed regularly”. As the last review was conducted in 2007, the Bank Act requires that this be completed this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673698">For the information of members and Canadians watching at home, the current five year review was launched on September 20, 2010 when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> initiated an open public consultation process on how to improve our financial system.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2673699">Here in Canada, the financial sector plays a key role in fostering financial stability, safeguarding Canadians' savings and fuelling economic growth and productivity. Aside from the fact that these institutions offer essential services worldwide, the industry employs over 750,000 Canadians. It represents about 7% of Canada's GDP and is known for its use of information technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673700">Not only are our banks the foundation of our economy, but their strength and stability are a model for the entire world. Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries, we did not have to nationalize, bail out or buy stock in our banks. In fact, for the fourth year in a row, the World Economic Forum has stated that Canada has the soundest banks in the world. The Financial System Review Act will help to ensure that our banks remain strong and effective and that they adapt to the new realities of an evolving global marketplace. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2673701">As the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association has noted, the act represents a welcome fine tuning of the various financial institution statutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673702">To effectively describe the benefits of this proposed legislation to the House it is worth revisiting our government's response to recent financial volatility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673703">Beginning in 2007 and through 2008, turmoil in global markets revealed serious weakness in the international financial system. Around the world many major financial institutions failed and needed to be bailed out by governments at the expense of taxpayers, but not here in Canada. Thanks to sound regulation by our Conservative government, not one single bank failed and not a single bailout was necessary, making Canada a model for the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673704">Listen for example to the words of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron who praised our banking system on a recent visit to Canada:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673705">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In the last few years, Canada has got every major decision right. Look at the facts. Not a single Canadian bank fell or faltered during the global banking crisis... Your economic leadership has helped the Canadian economy to weather the global storms far better than many of your international competitors.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="2673706">
                <I>The Irish Times</I> also declared that Canada's “strict banking supervision was a reason why it was one of the world's strongest performers during the recession”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673707">The International Monetary Fund also said it “commended Canada's strong financial regulation and supervision. This has resulted in a stable and resilient banking sector, which has resisted the international financial crisis well and remains well prepared to deal with most adverse scenarios”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673708">A U.S. Congressional Research Service report added that “Canada's financial system in particular is garnering attention, because it seemed to be more resistant to the failures and bailouts that have marked banks in the United States and Europe”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673709">Even so, we have responded to the crisis with quick action to ensure the long-term stability of our financial system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2673710">First, in budget 2008, the government ensured that the Bank of Canada had modern, appropriate tools to enhance the stability of the financial system when necessary. In fact, the Bank of Canada used these improved tools to protect our financial system, particularly by redistributing liquid assets to financial institutions, which was key to preserving the flow of credit to Canadians and businesses during the so-called credit crunch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673711">In budget 2009, the Conservative government also strengthened the authority of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, or CDIC. This enhancement gave CDIC a broader range of tools to provide financial assistance to troubled financial institutions, thus promoting stability and protecting Canadian's deposits. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2673712">We also took steps to protect our mortgage market. The American sub-prime mortgage crisis, and the recession which followed, illustrate the importance of a stable and well functioning housing market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673713">In Canada, our system of mortgage insurance ensures that real estate remains stable. In order to protect it from the dangerous excesses experienced by other countries, our government has acted three times to adjust the mortgage guarantee framework. These adjustments included reducing the maximum amortization period to 30 years from 35 years for government-backed insured mortgages with loan-to-value ratios of more than 80%. We also reduced borrowing limits for refinancing and withdrew government insurance from home equity lines of credit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673714">In budget 2011, our government announced that we would give the current rules on the mortgage insurance framework a basis in legislation. This would further promote financial stability. We are actively developing this framework.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2673715">As you can see, the government has not been idle since the last financial institutions legislative review in 2006. We have renewed many key elements of our financial system and bolstered it by adding new tools to ensure its stability. It is perhaps because of these changes that, during the consultations conducted during the 2011 review, we found that only a few minor adjustments are now necessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673716">Numerous detailed and thoughtful submissions were received from various stakeholders, including industry associations, financial institutions, consumer groups and individual Canadians. I am pleased to announce that the participants were satisfied with the process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2673717">The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association stated at the Senate committee on banking, trade and commerce, which completed its study of this bill late last year, that:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673718">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The consultation process was very positive and reflected the technical nature of this review.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673719">From these consultations, we received a number of excellent proposals for fine-tuning, clarifying, harmonizing and modernizing the existing framework. Our government has listened and is committed to doing just that with the proposals contained in the bill before the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673720">The current framework works well. Canada's financial system continues to be recognized as one of the soundest in the world. With that in mind, I will outline the key measures contained in Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> for members and Canadians watching at home. I remind them that this is very technical in nature. I hope that they will be able to understand the measures I will outline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673721">The proposed legislative package includes measures that will: respond to changes in the sector; ensure access to banking services for all Canadians; level the playing field by promoting co-operation among our financial institutions; improve the efficiency of our system; and, finally, clarify the intent of existing legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673722">Among the examples, to better respond to changes in the sector, our government is improving the ability of regulators to share information efficiently with their international counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673723">Also, to keep pace with the growing global financial sector we are increasing the widely held ownership threshold for large banks from $8 billion to $12 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673724">To ensure universal access to banking services, the legislation clarifies that all Canadians, including bank customers, are able to cash government cheques under $1,500 free of charge at any bank in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673725">To better protect consumers, we will enhance the supervisory powers of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada by increasing the maximum penalty for a violation of a consumer provision, consistent with penalties for other violations under financial institutions statutes. To improve efficiency, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will have the authority to issue a certificate to assist financial institutions in documenting incorporation information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673726">I am especially pleased with the responsiveness of <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document>'s measures to promote co-operation among our financial institutions. I would like to highlight them now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673727">For instance, federal credit unions will vote with the co-operatives class in the governance of the Canadian Payments Association. Competition and innovation will be promoted by enabling co-operative credit associations to provide technology services to a broader market. We have heard time and time again from stakeholders about the importance of these changes to the Canadian Payments Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673728">The Credit Union Central of Canada stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673729">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Placing the federal credit union in the cooperatives class will preserve and strengthen the credit union system representation at the CPA. It will ensure that a federal credit union will be represented by a director, who speaks for the interests of cooperative financial institutions in CPA matters. A strong advocate at the CPA is important for the credit union system's ability to advocate on behalf of credit unions and to continue to operate payments facility efficiently and cost effectively, which has a direct impact on overall credit union system competitiveness.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673730">Furthermore, the legislation reduces red tape and lessens the administrative burden for federally regulated insurance companies offering adjustable policies in foreign jurisdictions by removing duplicative disclosure requirements.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2673731">Here are some of the other technical changes included in Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> to improve the efficiency of the financial sector. Mutual funds controlled by insurance companies through investments made from segregated funds will be permitted to hold market-indexed shares in managing life insurance companies. Greater flexibility will be provided in adjusting to new terminology under the international financial reporting standards in order to continue to promote prudential objectives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673732">Future adjustments on the limits on transfers to shareholders from participating policy accounts will be facilitated by adding regulatory flexibility. The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act will be fine-tuned to enhance the corporation’s ability to protect insured depositors and manage the resolution of a member institution. Limited testimonial immunity will be provided to the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, as well as their employees and agents, to enhance operational efficiencies and protect the confidentiality of information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673733">Finally, the bill before us includes a number of technical changes to clarify intent. For example, the bill clarifies the order of priorities where multiple security interests, including those taken under the Bank Act and under provincial legislation, are taken on the same collateral. It clarifies that derivatives can be cleared by a clearing and settlement system. It also confirms that banks can have an asset manager who also acts as a trustee of a mutual fund trust. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2673734">Many of the financial sector solutions now being promoted and adopted around the globe are based on the Canadian system that has served us so very well. For the fourth year in a row, the World Economic Forum rated Canada's banking system as the soundest in the world and as noted, <I>Toronto Sun</I> columnist, Peter Worthington, observed, “Canada's banking system is now widely recognized as arguably the world’s best. No Canadians fear for their deposits as many Americans do”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673735">The measures proposed in the financial system review act will further strengthen our system by reinforcing stability in the financial sector, fine tuning the consumer protection framework and adjusting the regulatory framework to better adapt to new developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673736">As I have mentioned, the statutes which govern federally regulated financial institutions are subject to a five-year review cycle to ensure that Canada remains a global leader in financial services. It is imperative that this legislation be renewed by April 20 to allow financial institutions to stay in business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673737"> Today's act would provide for a framework that would benefit Canadians by ensuring that we would have a safe and secure financial system that we could rely on by maintaining the long-standing practice of ensuring reviews of the regulatory framework for financial institutions, a unique practice that sets Canada apart from almost every other country in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673738">Our Conservative government recognizes that it must constantly evaluate what regulatory changes are needed to foster competitiveness and ensure the safety and soundness of our financial system for the benefit of all Canadians, and we have done exactly that with the measures contained in the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673739">As the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association noted during the Senate committee stage consideration, “prompt passage of the bill will ensure the legislative stability and continuity that are so important to the financial services sector”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673740">I therefore urge all members in the House to give the financial system review act careful consideration. I hope that opposition members will allow us to ensure that this moves quickly and prepares Canadians for more good things to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2673744">With regard to the bill, I acknowledge, as my colleague mentioned, that this will affect hundreds of thousands of Canadians. In fact, it will affect all Canadians. Financial systems affect not only the people who are working, but those who are benefiting from other forms of income. For example, it benefits our children. Therefore, it is very important that we continue to evaluate and ensure we get this right for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673745">With regard to the Senate, we have some wonderful senators who work very hard to help move these kinds of very important legislation forward. The legislation has to go through both Houses before a decision can finally be implemented. We have a number of agenda items that affect the financial system and Canadians, including the pooled registered pension plan that we introduced recently and a number of other bills that are coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673746">Since we have such a charged agenda, it is important that we also move Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> because of the sunset date. In our opinion, it is prudent to ensure we get this through as quickly as possible and use the expertise and the senators in a way that would help us do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673747">I assure the member that the senators took great care in looking at the bill, as we will in the House. We have had a number of reviews already and I look forward to that member voting in favour to pass the bill in a timely manner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2673748">Madam Speaker, while I listened to the hon. parliamentary secretary, I could not help but be struck by what I would consider taking undue credit for the strength of the Canadian financial system. I am glad the legislation has some renewals on sunset clauses and technical amendments because, in the past, Conservatives urged deregulation of Canada's financial system. I believe the strength of Canada's financial system really is due to the resistance by previous Liberal governments to deregulate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673749">After the 2006 election, we had proof of the Conservative's desire to deregulate when the finance minister brought in 40-year mortgages with no down payment. Over the years, they realized that was a mistake because it encouraged consumers to take on too much risk. We know that the allowance of these mortgages was amended over the years. A couple of years later it was changed so that only 35 years was allowed for the period of a mortgage, requiring a down payment of 5%. Just last year they said that was maybe a little too risky. They had to back off some more and changed it to 30 years, with a 5% down payment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673750">The bill is worth supporting because the renewal of the sunset clauses is needed as well as some of the technical amendments, which could be tweaked. However, I want to counter what the parliamentary secretary has said in taking credit for the strength of Canada's financial system, which is recognized by the rest of the world.

Our government has taken measures time and time again to strengthen the financial system and our ability to stay in a fiscally advantaged position. The IMF and OECD have both said that Canada is a place to do business because it has such a strong and sound banking system. It is because it has a tremendous regulatory system that it allows for this kind of thing to go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673755">I disagree wholeheartedly with the member's assertions about the Liberal record. In fact, I remind the member that it was the Liberals who stole $57 billion out of the EI account when it was in a surplus and put it toward their pet projects. In fact, it was our government that took a $38 billion sum and put it onto our debt so that it would save Canadians money and strengthen our system so we could weather things like the economic crisis much better than other countries. It is this government that has a record of doing good things for our fiscal system and not the government of Liberals and that colleague. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2673768">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document>. I thank the parliamentary secretary for her kind words with respect to my addition to the finance committee. I look forward to working with her and other members of that committee in the weeks and months ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673769">I want to make it clear that the official opposition will support Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> at second reading in principle. As she herself has said, it is a very technical bill. It has not received a lot of public discussion. As is the case with a bill of this nature, the devil is sometimes in the details. It will be incumbent upon us in the chamber and certainly members of the finance committee to bring witnesses forward and discuss those details to make sure there is not something untoward that causes concern. Assuming we do not find anything, we will support the bill at third reading, but we will see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673770">There is no question the financial services industry is a major financial force in this country. It employs hundreds of thousands of Canadian women and men and deals with trillions of dollars in assets. We also know that the banking industry is not an ordinary sector of the economy. Banks have the power to shape and influence the livelihoods of Canadians. They have the power to create currency through credit. Therefore, it is extremely important that we pay attention to the practices and procedures of these financial institutions. We only have to look at what has been happening around the world over the past couple of years to see how important that is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673771">While I want to go through the bill to some degree, I want to say at the outset that it makes me chuckle how the Conservatives like to take credit for the Canadian banking system that has relied on a strong regulatory and supervisory tradition and framework. Unlike our American neighbours, the Canadian government, but more importantly Canadians, have recognized how important it is that we not allow our financial institutions to run amok and do what it is they do. We therefore have been slower in deregulating our financial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673772">I suggest that had there not been a minority government from 2005 onward and given what we have seen over the past number of months since the Conservatives have been in a majority situation, they may have moved before 2008 to remove some of the important regulations that saved our system in 2008. Luckily we got through that time. Even they recognize the value of maintaining regulations and supervisory control over the industry and we are continuing in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673773">We saw with the financial meltdown that we in this country are not immune to what happens in foreign countries. It was the single largest default by a foreign financial institution which created a domino effect. It affected us and financial markets around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673774">It is important to recognize, which I know the government has failed to do on a number of occasions, that the Bank of Canada back in 2008 had to advance $75 billion through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to buy back $75 billion in mortgages from Canadian chartered banks to stem a liquidity crisis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2673775">While the Conservatives want to try to take credit, it is important to recognize it is an established tradition that Canadians have followed. I am glad that we are going to continue along those lines for the foreseeable future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673776">We have a few concerns with respect to the process by which Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> reached the House. The government made a commitment in the last budget that it was going to initiate a review at that time. There is a statutory sunset clause that comes into effect on April 20 this year. The government recognized that we have to conduct this review. Unfortunately, what it did was post a request for submissions on the website. It was very quietly done, and it did not seek permission from the groups and individuals who were submitting that those presentations would be allowed to be public. Only 3 of the 30 submissions that were made have been made public and that was by those organizations themselves that posted the information on the government's website. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673777">This idea gets to what the parliamentary secretary said in her debate. She said to Canadians who were watching that this is a very technical bill and that she would talk about very technical issues which they might not understand. That is an issue which goes to the heart of the whole question of consultation around such important matters. We need to demystify these issues. We need to present them in common language so that Canadians do understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673778">One problem we are facing, which has been cited by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, is that Canadians are overly indebted. Household debt has reached very problematic levels. Part of the reason we run into these situations is that we do not have a sufficiently clear and honest discussion about matters such as those contained in the bill. The questions that have been dealt with by the bill deal with consumer protection. Those are matters in which Canadians should be involved. Canadians are continuing to be gouged, in that hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and taxes are being imposed by the banks on every type of financial activity. Canadians need to play a role in discussions on the regulations that the government permits and the legislation that goes through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673779">It is a concern to us that the government decided to introduce this legislation in the unelected chamber. It did not start such an important bill before the members of this House who are duly elected by Canadians. The government took another route. Some would say the bill came in through the back door. It came in through the Senate. Even some august senators said that there was not sufficient time given to them to have a proper review of it. They raised concerns about it. I also asked that question of the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673780"> Members of this caucus hope that the government will not bring in closure number 14 on this bill to limit debate by elected members of the House. This is far too important. It is important that Canadians understand what is going on. We need to take every opportunity to explain what it is that is being proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document>, to ask questions of government, to listen to the answers, and to have a general debate about what it is contained in the bill and how it will affect Canadians. That is what we are going to do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2673781">It has been suggested that there are a multitude of housekeeping changes. However, there are a few things within the bill that I would like to speak to directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673782">We welcome the broadening of the supervisory and enforcement powers of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and the broadening of the jurisdictional scope of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673783">We heard this morning that the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions is watching closely the practices of banks, which appear to be loosening up credit, in some instances. That it is paying attention is a good thing. It is a good thing that the banks and financial institutions are not going to go down the road of predatory lending practices, which would have an impact. We have seen they have had an impact in other countries. We would not want to see that happen here. We welcome the broadening of the jurisdictional scope of the superintendent that is contained in the bill. However, we would say there was an opportunity in the bill for the government to go further to protect Canadian citizens from the predatory monopolistic practices of the banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673784">I said that we have concerns that Canadians continue to be gouged by the banks in the form of service charges, user fees, and abusive credit card rates. That is one of the reasons we need to have a fulsome debate with Canadians about issues regarding our financial institutions and borrowing and lending practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673785">It is also a fact that we need to provide in the bill and in regulation further protection for consumers because they are continuing to be gouged. The former leader of the opposition, Mr. Layton, was an outspoken advocate for a reduction in the credit card interest rates and the predatory practices of the banks and financial institutions as they dealt with credit cards. That is something we believe needs to happen. It is particularly galling at a time when these extra charges on Canadians are allowing banks to recognize record profits, which last year amounted to $25.5 billion, at a time when Canadian wages are declining. It is just wrong and we need to deal with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673786">The responsibility for consumer protection unfortunately is not dealt with in this legislation. It is dispersed among multiple jurisdictions, departments and agencies. Again, it raises doubts as to whether the government is truly committed to the robust protection of consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673787">The modest changes that are brought about for consumer protection in the bill have yet to be tested by consumer advocates and users. We certainly hope we have the opportunity at the finance committee to bring representatives forward to deal with these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673788">We are concerned by increasingly risky lending practices in terms of mortgages and home equity credit lines by banks and other lending institutions. That concern is well-founded. It is something we heard about today and is shared by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. Members of this House and members of the finance committee need to pay attention to that when we are discussing this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673789">Again let me say that it was through greater regulation that Canada avoided the mortgage-induced crisis, such as the one that occurred in the United States in 2007-08. We have a strong tradition in this country of supervisory and regulatory protections over our banking system, and we need to ensure that we are vigilant going forward.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2673790">This bill is missing an important step in creating a stronger economy, the regulation of financial speculation and derivatives. Billions of dollars continue to be gambled on a regular basis, destabilizing the economy and providing no benefit to everyday citizens. The government should use this opportunity to work in concert with other governments to halt the destructive speculation in Canada and abroad. We are also concerned that under this bill, large foreign acquisitions by financial institutions would be subject to ministerial approval rather than simply the approval of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. We think this will unnecessarily politicize important decisions. These decisions should not be made in a partisan manner because there is the potential for political influence being exerted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673791">While I talk about the fact that the banking system in Canada has a tradition of regulation and supervision that has helped us avoid the kind of problems we have seen in other jurisdictions, there is a darker side to our stronger banking system. Canadian chartered banks have dominated the domestic market for decades. Their dominance and the fact that both Liberal and Conservative governments have only paid lip service to this issue have allowed them to continue to extract abusive fees, taxing Canadian consumers. These fees have created $25 billion in profits for the banking system. They provide the banks with enough net revenue to offset eventual speculative losses on the international capital markets and from overseas ventures, and allow them to pay out generous seven-figure bonuses to their CEOs and dividends to shareholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673792">In addition, Canadian banks have been benefiting for years from tax-arbitered schemes such as the dividend gross-up mechanism that has allowed them to reduce their effective tax rates by acquiring Canadian dividend-paying stocks while hedging away the economic risk of those stocks by the use of derivatives. Banks sometimes share those tax savings with non-taxable entities, such as pension funds. This amounts to an effective tax subsidy that costs Canadian taxpayers sums that could well be in the billions of dollars. In addition to the tax effects, dividend gross-up mechanisms tie up bank capital for years and trump bank lending to small businesses and entrepreneurs. This is a complex issue that deserves much more scrutiny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673793">The changes being brought forward by Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> are modest. They could be greater as they relate to consumer protection. There is much work to be done and we cannot be complacent. We have seen turmoil and the damage that can be done by over-speculation and risky lending by financial institutions around the world, and we need to be constantly vigilant. However, I again say to the members opposite that we need to have this conversation about lending, borrowing and spending openly with Canadians. We need to deal with the problems created by the lack of financial literacy in this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2673794">We recognize that the increasing indebtedness of ordinary Canadians is a serious problem. The economy continues to be flat and has not been growing to expectations. Recently, we heard announcements indicating that the job creation figures continue to be weak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673795">The government is moving in directions that are having a detrimental impact on Canadians. We need to have important and respectful conversations about matters as important as to how we are managing our financial system in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673796">As I said earlier, we will be supporting the bill as it moves forward from second reading to committee. I look forward as a member of that committee to engaging with witnesses and starting to deal with some of the details so we can find out exactly what is in this legislation and make sure that it is as strong as possible for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2673798">I want the government to recognize the fact that as the world economy was going into a downward spiral, Canada stood out on top. Other economies in the world recognized how strong and healthy Canada's financial markets were. They did that because of inspirational leaders like Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien and Liberal administrations that believed in having a regulated industry. Those individuals did more than anything the Conservative government has ever done to protect the integrity of the financial institutions we have in Canada today. The government needs to be aware of that fact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673799">When the Conservatives talk about financial responsibilities, they need to be aware of the fact that when they took office there was a $60 billion surplus handed to them. The Conservatives need to recognize that they are the ones who are messing up priorities, and we need only look at what they are doing to seniors in this wealthy country of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673800">I would ask my colleague about the potential role of credit unions in this regard. Over the last five to ten years our credit unions have been expanding in places where banks have been withdrawing. They have been making it more affordable for the average consumer to do more banking, whether online or offline or going to the counter for services. I believe there is a good role for credit unions in the Canadian financial market in the future. </ParaText>

They should be commended for the work they do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673803">I will also respond in part to the member's quibble with the Conservative government for trying to take credit for the banking system. That member wants the Liberals to have the credit for the banking system. The traditions of our banking system are well established. They were established by members of the House, by Canadians from one end of this country to the other, who worked hard to make sure that we have a viable, respected and trusted banking system in this country. We should be thanking Canadians for responsible financial management rather than trying to break our arms by patting ourselves on the back.</ParaText>

Without bothering to notify stakeholders or the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agri-Food, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency declared that the Quebec method of producing ice wine prohibits Quebec wineries from using the “ice wine” appellation. Yet, this method, which is used because of the climate, is recognized by the Government of Quebec and the International Organization of Vine and Wine.</ParaText>

If this trend of losing one refinery per year continues, there may not be a single refinery operating in Canada by 2030. This puts Canada in an absurd position. We will be shipping our crude oil out to China and the U.S. and then buying it back as gasoline. This is softwood lumber on steroids.</ParaText>

This government recognizes that innovation fuels business competitiveness, quality and productivity and, ultimately, jobs for hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673852">One businessperson has said that this program is “about the government recognizing that the gap between innovators' ideas and the marketplace is simply someone willing to bet on them, willing to take a chance on their product and then willing to give them feedback”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2673853">Today our government has announced that we are doing just that with 35 more Canadian businesses promoting 36 innovations. We know this is an important step to help them create jobs and economic growth in Canada.</ParaText>

The scheme the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced in Switzerland does not make those human needs go away for those modest income seniors. It just dumps them onto provincial welfare. How is that any better?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674041">Madam Speaker, in a recent <I>National Post</I> article, B.C. journalist Terry Glavin raised concerns about the extent of Chinese ownership in the oil sands. He pointed out that Sinopec, which is owned by the Communist Party of China and is the seventh largest corporation in the world, plus PetroChina and a number of others now have a $20 billion stake in direct ownership of the oil sands. He raised this question: “Just how Sinopec became co-author of” the Prime Minister's “new foreign policy and energy strategy isn't a question any of us are supposed to be asking”. </ParaText>

On the surface, this bill does not seem particularly controversial to me. However, as usual, the Conservative government's way of doing things, its approach and its attitude leave much to be desired. Once again, the government has introduced a bill that it says must be passed immediately. In other words, this government sees no need to consult Canadians or experts. The government would probably tell people that, since it is in power, it can make any decision it likes. It does not matter what anyone else thinks; this bill must be passed right away.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674091">Madam Speaker, I was trying to save time. I thought I had received unanimous consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674092">On the surface, this bill does not seem to have any major points of contention, as I have already said, but we cannot assume that everyone sees it that way. Financial institutions are a pillar of our economy and have to be treated with more respect. Allowing the Minister of Finance to have veto power over the acquisition of foreign entities by Canadian banks is something that should be analyzed further. The government tells us that this is to allow us to prevent crises like the one in 2008, but is this really necessary? No Canadian bank had problems similar to the ones experienced by the American or European banks and there is nothing to suggest that this could happen in the near future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674093">Why are the Conservatives imposing this condition in the bill? Do they have a hidden agenda? We do not know. Do they have any studies to support the fact that this necessary? Why do they not leave this responsibility to the real professionals? Representatives from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, who have always done excellent work, would be better qualified for this responsibility. Perhaps we are giving this veto power to the minister simply because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, as we all know, always likes to be in control of everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674094">All these questions make us realize one thing: the Conservatives do not like studies. They believe they have the answers to all the problems and they pass legislation without any consultation or debate. In 1995, former finance minister Paul Martin introduced the Bank Act and saw it passed. That legislation was not sloppy or passed at the last minute. We spent a year preparing it before passing it. The Liberal government at the time held many consultations and put a committee in charge of the matter. Public consultations were held, and the Liberals listened to expert advice in order to ensure that the legislation was drafted properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674095">The Liberal government of the day had a majority, as the Conservatives do today. Yet it did not impose legislation at the last minute or limit debate; instead, it listened to what parliamentarians and all Canadians had to say. This Liberal legislation saved our banks from the financial collapse of 2008. Now, we have barely two months to pass this bill. The problem is that parliamentarians are not necessarily experts in banking. We use banking services, but we are not experts. Consultations with people in the industry are needed, for instance, with people who receive and provide services, managers and others. And that takes time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674096">As I said earlier, is it really necessary to give the finance minister more power? Would another person or institution have been in a better position to make these decisions? Is there really a problem?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674097">Since we are taking the time to tackle the question of banks, are there other aspects that we should also focus on, as we heard this morning? Is this the best solution for the problem? These are some of the basic questions that could have been answered with an in-depth study. The last time we reviewed the legislation on financial institutions, in 2006 and 2007, I was chair of the Standing Committee on Finance and we examined Bill <Document DbId="2531869" Type="3">C-37</Document>. Thanks to the hard work of the Liberal members on the committee, we led consultations that lasted over three months. That diligent work allowed us to find several flaws in the Conservative bill. It is hard to do the same work today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674098">As I said earlier, the main problem with this bill is not so much its content as the uncertainty surrounding its review, given that the government does not intend to consult the players involved. This problem could have easily been avoided had the government introduced this bill in October rather than in February since, I repeat, the bill must be passed before April 20. The House of Commons simply does not have the time to seriously consider this bill. Even in the Senate, Senator Hervieux-Payette stated that they simply did not have time to thoroughly examine the issue. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674099">What were the Conservatives thinking when they introduced this bill in the Senate on November 23, 2011? The bill was read for the second time on December 6, 2011, just before the long Christmas break. Today, it is February 3 and the government is only now presenting the bill for second reading. Rather than wasting their time abolishing the firearms registry and rushing to pass regressive legislation to imprison our youth, why did the Conservatives not begin seriously reviewing the Bank Act? This is an urgent situation that needs to be resolved because, as I mentioned, the act must be revised before April 20. This should have been a priority but the Conservatives would rather invent threats than take care of real problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674100">Another problematic aspect of this bill is the fact that the changes to this legislation would allow a foreign government to own shares in a Canadian bank and thus have voting rights. How does this help Canadian banks? We do not know. Taxpayers who have pension plans with banks do not even have the right to vote, so why should a foreign government? What will the effects of this be? I doubt that we will have an answer before this reformed legislation is passed because we do not have enough time to consider the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674101">In summary, I am not against this bill but there are still some unresolved issues because this government took its time and did not adequately plan for this review of the Bank Act. A competent government, like the one that existed when the Liberals were in power, would have conducted many studies and allowed parliamentarians to carefully consider this bill. Now, there is not enough time and we will not know all the effects this bill will have until after it is passed.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2674110">Madam Speaker, the strength of the banking and financial system in Canada is that its legal framework is perpetually sunsetted every five years. It has to be re-enacted or it expires. Some might think this is a source of uncertainty or weakness, but the opposite is really true. By requiring Parliament to re-examine Canada's banking laws every five years, we are forced to pay attention and to keep them strong and up to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674111">Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> is a product of this five-year review process. It certainly has the questions that have just been referred to by my colleague, but hopefully Parliament will be able to address those questions in a satisfactory manner in the time that remains before the bill needs to be passed. It has to be enacted before April 20, 2012, to keep our whole system intact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674112">In that sense, this proposed legislation is rather routine. It renews and extends Canada's basic financial laws for another five years. That is important, but beyond that, Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document>, quite frankly, is not very ambitious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674113">It does not, for example, address the chronic problem that small businesses have in getting fairness from the big banks on their debit and credit card arrangements. It does not address the problem that will soon arise from another piece of legislation that was before the House this week, and that is the bill creating the new pooled registered pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674114">Experience in other countries has demonstrated that a key issue will be the management fees and the other charges enacted by big financial institutions to operate these new pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674115">A report from Australia shows that its PRPP system generated handsome profits for banks and insurance companies, but the average pensioner would actually have been better off simply buying a government bond. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674116">There is nothing in legislation from the government to ensure a level of return on PRPPs equivalent to the extraordinary performance of the Canada pension plan, or to prevent fee gouging by the banks, insurance companies and other companies that run these new plans. Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> is probably most noteworthy for what it does not do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674117">The last significant work on the overall framework governing our financial sector was undertaken some 15 years ago by the Task Force on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector. It was chaired for Canada by an eminent Saskatchewanian, Mr. Harold MacKay. His report was a powerful piece of work. He laid out those principles and values that have given this country the strongest financial services sector in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674118">The current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to travel the world bragging about the success of Canadian banks and financial institutions. He did so in his recent alpine speech to the rich and famous in Davos, Switzerland. Before he launched his attack on low and middle income future seniors, he spent some time taking credit for the strength of Canadian banks as well as for the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674119">There is more than a little irony here; some would say hypocrisy. In the mid-1990s, when Mr. MacKay was doing his work, there was huge pressure on the Liberal government of the day to go in the opposite direction. The big banks and the political right in Canada, including the predecessors of the Conservative government, were pushing hard for what they called a more American-like system. They wanted weaker prudential standards. They wanted less regulatory oversight. They wanted big banks to merge, so the biggest five or six could become the big two or three, and they could better take on the American competition, like Lehman Brothers, for example. That was their Conservative line back then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674120">All that right-wing advice turned out to be really bad advice. Lehman Brothers and other U.S. banks have gone the way of the dodo bird, and Canadian banks have turned out to be the most successful and the most respected.</ParaText>

They went on the attack against the CPP, the Canada pension plan. They called it a huge boondoggle. They called it a big, European-style socialist welfare scheme. They said it should be scrapped altogether, that Canadians should just fend for themselves with private savings. The rich, of course, would do very well under a scheme like that, and as for all the rest, well, who cares. That was the right-wing line back in the 1990s. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674122">We can hear echoes of that sort of thing today in the current debate about old age security and the old age pension. Never mind that 75% of those who receive the old age pension have incomes below $40,000. Never mind that many are elderly widows living alone. Never mind that without the old age pension, poverty among seniors would rise by as much as one-third. “Never mind all that”, the right-wingers say, “just cut them back and let provincial welfare programs pick up the slack”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674123">There is only one taxpayer, federal or provincial. Cutting down the OAS would not make the human needs go away. It would just download the burden onto the provinces, like health care downloading and prison cost downloading. It is false economy. That is true today, just as it was 10 or 15 years ago, when the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his colleagues attacked the CPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674124">He went to Davos and bragged about how the CPP is so actuarially sound, which it is, but no thanks to him. It was refurbished for the future despite the Conservatives, not because of them. The CPP has a superlative investment and return record and the plan is assured for at least another 75 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674125">Once in government, the incompetence of the party across the way has continued. The Conservatives increased federal spending by three times the rate of inflation. They eliminated contingency reserves and prudence factors from federal budget making and they put Canada back into deficit again, all before there was any recession, not because of the recession, but before it. Then during the recession they dug their deficit hole deeper and deeper, $50 billion or more per year, with no coherent rules or objectives. Millions of dollars were siphoned into useless pork-barrel projects like the G8 and G20 fiasco, with all its fake lakes, ornamental gazebos, and sidewalks to nowhere. The Auditor General called it unprecedented and very wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674126">Now, while earmarking billions to be squandered on bigger jails and wildly expensive fighter jets, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says his government can no longer afford pillars of Canadian life like universal health care and old age pensions for middle- and low-income seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674127">The fiscal pressure on the Conservatives is entirely self-concocted and they are rather happy about that. I can hear them chuckling across the way right now. They want an excuse to pull away from medicare and pensions, and they really could care less who suffers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674128">It is important to keep Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> in context. It will be passed before April 20 to maintain Canada's banking success. However, for so many Canadians beyond the big banks the story is not very rosy. Economic growth stalled in October; it turned negative in November. Household debt is at an all-time record high, at 153% of disposable income. Unemployment went up again last month and it worsened again just today, with another 450 jobs lost at the Electro-Motive plant in London.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674129">Strong banks are a must, but they are certainly not all by themselves sufficient to achieve a strong, successful country overall with growing and shared prosperity for all Canadians. It is that last element that the government seems to care very little about. It does not care if growth is sustainable. It certainly does not care if it is shared. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674130">We will continue to battle the Conservatives on that fundamental principle: prosperity. We have proven we know the formula for making the economy grow. We did that through 12 very successful years of economic prosperity in this country. We also must work together on the sharing and the sustainability of that prosperity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674142">Former prime minister Paul Martin used to quote a number of around 7% as a natural rate of unemployment.

              <ParaText id="2674143">Madam Speaker, the definition of that term depends on a number of the factors used to consider what is natural or unnatural. In the United States I believe that number is guesstimated to be in the neighbourhood of 4%. In Canada it would be somewhat higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674144">Since the time that Mr. Martin was the minister of finance, 10 or 15 years ago, I suspect that the number has come down a bit below the 7% figure. The most profound influence on that calculation today is the aging of the baby boomer generation. It may well be, before the 7% moderates very much, that we will have to get past the retirement rate of the baby boomers, which is a very significant economic factor.</ParaText>

Bill S-5 is important legislation because it provides a framework to regulate financial products and services, helping to ensure the continued safety and security of our financial system that Canadians and their families depend on every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674146">Before continuing, by way of background, I would note for the benefit of the House that today's legislation is the result of a mandated review. In Canada financial sector legislation is subject to a full review on a five-year cycle to ensure the stability of the sector, with the latest review completed in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674147">The current review began with a public and open consultation process in September 2010, when all Canadians were invited to share their views on how to improve and strengthen our financial system. This practice sets Canada apart from almost every other country in the world and ensures that laws and regulations by which our financial systems are governed remain the safest and most secure anywhere.</ParaText>

Only days ago, an independent global organization, known as the Financial Stability Board, praised Canada's financial system, calling it a model for all countries. The Financial Stability Board stated:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The strength of the economy and of the financial system at the onset of the crisis meant that no Canadian financial institution failed or required government support in the form of a capital injection or debt guarantees.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674154">As the past few years have shown, international praise for our system is well-founded. While the global financial crisis resulted in nearly $2 trillion in losses for banks and insurance companies, Canada's banks stood solid, bolstered by sound risk management and supported by an effective regulatory and supervisory framework. In fact, Canada was the only country in the G7 that did not have to bail out its major banks with taxpayer money in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674155">I neglected to announce that I am splitting my time today with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170234" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674156">This Canadian resilience matters. A strong financial sector plays a fundamental role in supporting a strong economy, and not just in times of crisis. Families, workers, retirees and pensioners count on it for the security and growth of their deposits and investments and to maintain the standard of living that they worked hard to build. Consumers rely on it for competitive financial products to keep their mortgages and other household financing affordable. Businesses, large and small, also depend on it for access to competitive financing to allow them to invest and grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674157">The financial crisis highlighted the importance of evaluating the overall size of financial institutions, their global linkages and the impact of these factors on the best interests of Canada's financial system. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674158">The crisis also resulted in extensive changes in the regulatory framework, which continues to ensure that Canada is home to one of the safest and soundest financial sectors anywhere in the world. The financial system review act would build on these reforms and fine-tune the efficiency and effectiveness of this framework. It would improve the ability of regulators to share information efficiently with their international counterparts. This would help to fulfill our G20 commitments at a time when financial institutions increasingly operate on a global scale and would ensure effective supervision and regulation across borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674159">The bill also recognizes the implications of global reform on Canadian banks. Since 2001, Canadian banks and their holdings have grown significantly. The new Basel III capital standards in 2013 will further increase capital levels. Based on projections until 2017, the threshold defining a large bank will be raised to maintain the current policy. Today's bill would increase the large bank ownership threshold from $8 billion to $12 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674160">Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> would also strengthen consumer protection for the financial sector, most notably by enhancing the supervisory powers of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada also known as the FCAC. The agency is mandated to ensure that federally regulated financial institutions adhere to the consumer provisions of the legislation governing financial institutions and their public commitments. FCAC is also the government's lead agency on financial education and literacy and has moved forward with an array of excellent initiatives in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674161"> The agency has developed innovative tools to help Canadians plan their financial future, like a mortgage calculator that quickly determines payments as well as the potential savings which can be realized by paying early. It also publishes valuable information online to help consumers choose credit card and banking packages best suited to their own needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674162">Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> also proposes to increase the maximum fine that can be levied by the agency for consumer protection violations to better protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674163">Finally, the financial system review act would build on this government's ongoing actions to cut red tape by proposing to reduce the administrative burden on financial institutions and increase regulatory flexibility. This includes eliminating duplicative disclosure requirements and allowing limited testimonial immunity for federal officials to enhance operational efficiencies. These measures would contribute to a well-functioning financial system that meets the needs of Canadians and supports our future economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674164">Today's legislation is important because it concerns one of the key foundations of the global economy. Canada's financial sector plays a pivotal role in fostering financial stability in safeguarding the savings of Canadians and in fuelling the economic growth that is essential to our standard of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674165"> We also recognize that Canada's financial sector is a critical component of the Canadian economy, employing over three-quarters of a million Canadians in well-paying jobs. What is more, the sector represents about 7% of Canada's GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674166">As the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association declared during the Senate's consideration of this important legislation, “prompt passage of the bill will ensure the legislative stability and continuity that are so important to the financial services sector”. Updates to the financial legislative framework will continue to ensure that Canada's financial institutions operate in a competitive, efficient and stable environment and will help Canada maintain its well-earned reputation as a global leader in financial services.</ParaText>

The government has a long established practice of reviewing the statutes governing federally regulated financial institutions every five years to maintain the safety and soundness of the sector for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674195">For the information of the House, the latest legislative review and subsequent legislation were completed in the 39th Parliament through Bill <Document DbId="2531869" Type="3">C-37</Document>. The present five-year review began in September 2010 when the finance minister launched an open consultation process with Canadians on how to improve our financial system. The financial system review act addresses a number of key areas that were identified in the review and consultation process to achieve increased legislative and regulatory efficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674196">Currently, financial institution statutes have a built-in sunset clause that causes them to lapse five years after they come into force. The proposed common sense amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">S-5</Document> modify the statutes to lengthen the automatic extension period of the sunset date, triggered by the dissolution of Parliament, from three months to six months. This will allow greater flexibility and more security for consumers and Canadian institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674197">We all know that consumers have the ability to manage their finances. In properly managing financial affairs, we know that knowledge is critical. That is why the government is moving forward to implement the recommendations of the task force on financial literacy aimed at improving financial literacy for all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674198">At the same time, the government is responding to concerns about the terms and conditions associated with network branded pre-paid cards by developing measures to enhance the consumer protection framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674199">Changes in today's legislation fine-tune the consumer protection framework and enhances the supervisory power of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada by confirming that all Canadians are able to cash government cheques in amounts of less than $1,500 free of charge at any bank in Canada; and increasing the maximum penalty for violation of a consumer provision, consistent with penalties for other violations under financial institution statutes. These are all important measures that will protect consumers when dealing with financial institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674200">As members know, the rate of change in the financial services sector has only increased in recent years. Another objective of today's act is to allow financial institutions to respond to change by allowing them to better adapt to new developments in the industry. In other words, financial institutions must be able to effectively respond to developing trends such as globalization, convergence, consolidation and technological innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674201">To summarize, the measures proposed in the financial system review act would reinforce stability in the financial sector, fine-tune the consumer protection framework and adjust the regulatory framework to new developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674202"> Renewing Canadian financial institution legislation on a regular basis has resulted in a robust and effective financial system that is aligned with and more responsive to developments in the financial markets and the broader economy. Today's act provides framework that would benefit all participants in the financial services sector, financial institutions as well as all Canadians. It maintains the longstanding practice of ensuring regular reviews of the regulatory framework for financial institutions, a unique practice that sets Canada apart from almost every other country in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674203">Therefore, I urge all members to support the proposed financial system review act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674220">Mr. Hollande, who is the Socialist Party candidate in the next French election, said that his enemy was faceless; that enemy would never be a candidate, was not a member of a political party and had no political platform, but nevertheless was in control. He was talking about the financial sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674221">At present, this bill certainly reflects his words. Here we have a bill that is remarkable not for what it says, but for what it does not say and what it does not do. It should be protecting the Canadian economy; it should be protecting Canadians; it should be protecting the economic aspirations of the Canadian public; but it does not do that. It is utterly and completely silent on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674222">There is probably good reason why this bill was introduced in the Senate. The bill was introduced to do nothing. It was introduced in haste. It contains only technical points and items that are hardly essential to the growth of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674223"> It does not talk about supporting industrial capital and investment in job creation, which our financial sector could be ordered to do. No, that is not what it talks about; it speaks only about purely technical items. We will see, later, that these technical items are essentially going to allow the financial sector to do more of the same: more money and more bonuses, but certainly no more services for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674224"> We have been talking about service charges and use of the banking sector for a long time, and this relates directly to the Bank Act. Those charges are excessive. They mean that consumers are not just the people who supply the banks with the money so they can lend it out again, but also the customers who have to pay truly excessive charges to use their own money. They have enabled the banking system to increase its profits to the $25 billion point, an impressive number indeed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674225"> At the same time, the financial sector’s budget for bonuses has climbed to $9 billion. That was the fastest-growing item in the financial sector. As in the United States, France and England, the financial sector is motivated by bonuses, and in that sector the board members have little to gain by defending the interests of the shareholders, their customers and the economy of their country. They are motivated solely by bonuses. In this regard, just like all the other laws in the other countries, the government of Canada is modelling its approach directly on the worst elements of the banking laws of the other countries. We could talk about excessive credit card interest rates. That is something that is directly connected with too many bankruptcies experienced by Canadians. They are not talking about that. They do not want to talk about it. There are a lot more things missing as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674226"> Let us talk about the waiting time that allows banking institutions to hold a cheque for a certain number of days. People deposit their cheques and cannot withdraw their money immediately. That means that an entire parallel service is created: a new financial sector, the cheque-depositing sector, where the cheque is paid out immediately in return for a charge that may range from 5% to 20%. But that is not a problem. We will not talk about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674227"> Nor is a compensation fund for victims of fraud being created by players in the financial industry, something that is considerably more serious. People are told to go ahead: the financial sector is safe and is there for them, but if it does not work out, no one will be there to support them anymore.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674228"> There will be no one to reimburse them and protect them, but in exchange, they will be allowed easier access to financial literacy. That was very useful to Nortel's shareholders and the people who invested in Norbourg, when those two companies were praised to the skies by the financial world. There were countless articles in the economic press praising the management of those two companies and encouraging Canadians to participate actively in financing them. And yet once again they decide it is not necessary to protect consumers and investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674229"> Even investors now have to take on the task of managing their own RRSPs. They alone will be responsible for losses in their RRSPs. That is impressive. Obviously, we are going to use the time for examining this bill in the Standing Committee on Finance to give it a few more teeth. In spite of the short time the government is giving us, we will be fighting hard to make this bill better suited to defending the interests of modern Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674230">The bill talks about foreign acquisitions, an important point, particularly in Canada; we have been visited by the Union de banques suisses, the UBS. We could call them “itinerant bankers” or carpetbaggers. These people represent a foreign financial institution— the UBS—and they send people to meet with the wealthiest Canadians and ask them to invest in their discreet, secret, numbered bank accounts and they will not have to pay Canadian income taxes. That is marvellous. And that is what they have done. The problem is that it is not really legal. It is called tax evasion. It is flat out illegal. And yet no lasting changes are being made to Canada’s Bank Act to prevent activities like that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674231"> There should be a power of life or death over a Canadian institution owned by foreign entities, to prohibit it from ever doing anything inside Canada. They could be much more stringent, and yet they are not. They are raising the ceiling on shareholder equity. They already raised it in 2007. At the time, it was $5 billion. Now we are told it has to be $12 billion. This is an opening for what is called leverage. It is going to be much easier to make speculative investments. That is the most obvious opening for speculation in the financial sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674232"> In other words, this bill is not an instrument to strengthen the regulatory framework that protects Canada, as it did in the last recession. The entire financial sector was unscathed. What we are really looking at is deregulation of all the intervening new economic factors. They are regulating only the old financial sector. The new one can do as it wishes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674233">On that last point, there is an important item to note: pooled registered pension plans, this government’s most recent invention. These plans will allow financial institutions to take money. All the Canadian workers who contribute to the plans will know exactly how much they will pay every week—$25 or $50 or $60—but they will never know exactly how much they will get when they retire. This is what is called a defined contribution plan. However, people will not know what their benefit rate will be when they reach the age of 65—or 67—depending on the whim of the people opposite. That will be largely determined by the management fees. That is why it is important to talk about this and to regulate this sector. </ParaText>

Most importantly, we have to ensure that the emerging economic sector is as well regulated as the old one so that people who invest in pooled registered pension plans can count on better protection than Canadians had during the latest economic recession.</ParaText>

However, before I begin, I would like to express my displeasure at the fact that this bill was examined by the other place before being studied here.

              <ParaText id="2674242">On the other hand, we do support this bill, the <Document DbId="5266523" Type="3">Financial System Review Act</Document>. We know that the financial services industry employs many Canadians. This sector is very important to the NDP. However, it is not necessarily straightforward. It is rather complex; it is not an ordinary sector for the economy. Banks and financial institutions have several ways of influencing politicians—this is more obvious if one looks at the other side of the House—and the economy. This very important sector forms part of the foundation of our country and our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674243">We know that the legislation must be reviewed every five years. The last review was in 2007. We find it deplorable that, when the opportunity arises to review such legislation, the review is done so quickly, without giving members the opportunity to closely examine the bill and without consulting the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674244">With regard to procedures, we know that the bill was examined by the unelected members of the Senate for three weeks. Moreover, after hearing Senator Boisvenu's comments, we are of the opinion that the Senate's judgment may sometimes leave something to be desired. Why not examine a bill as important as this one here in the House of Commons? Why not discuss it and find real solutions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674245">On this side of the House, we would like to abolish the Senate. Thus, we do not necessarily agree that this bill should have been examined there. This is an important bill since financial institutions really have an impact. We also find it deplorable that there were only 30 Internet submissions, 27 of which were anonymous. That was the basis for the study. Only three people dared to say where they were from and what their suggestions were. We do not feel as though the study was very thorough. We would definitely like to examine this bill more closely when it is sent to the Standing Committee on Finance. We must take the time to examine it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674251">The bill is designed to make March 26 Purple Day all across Canada every year. The purpose is to raise awareness of epilepsy and to help epilepsy sufferers, their families, friends and communities recognize that there are many among us who suffer from epilepsy, but they are a part of us. Awareness will help all of us recognize how to help epilepsy sufferers during seizures and reduce the stigma attached to epilepsy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674252">I will start by mentioning the presence here of Susan Harrison, executive director of the Epilepsy and Seizure Disorder Resource Centre in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170105" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674253">I am not standing on debate today because I am an expert on epilepsy. I am relatively ignorant of epilepsy. I am standing today because of a young woman who is a friend, a constituent and a resident of Kingston. She told me during the last election campaign that I really had to go to an event called Purple Day. At first I did not know what it was, but I attended it. I sat and listened and really realized that I did not understand epilepsy at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674254">I want to start off by thanking this young woman, Kim McFarlane, who is the secretary of the Epilepsy and Seizure Disorder Resource Centres of Southeastern Ontario, for inviting me to the event and also for sharing a lot of her own personal experiences, which I will relate in my speech today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674255">I did not know that, for example, one in a hundred people suffer from epilepsy. That means about 300,000 Canadians. Probably a couple of members of the House of Commons are epilepsy sufferers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674256">What is very important is I did not realize how many different types of epilepsy there were and that there were stereotypes, mostly in our visual entertainment, of what it meant to have an epilepsy seizure. That means we do not often recognize it in our daily lives. We may confuse it and think that something else is happening, when really we have to recognize that epilepsy is a possibility and deal with it accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674257">I would like to quote from my friend Kim, who talks about her own type of epilepsy. She says:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I apparently look spaced out with a glazed look over my face for 15 seconds to a minute. However, when I come around, I don't remember anything and usually I'm pretty tired. I could walk from point A to point B, but I won't remember how I got there. I could even have a conversation with someone, yet I won't remember a word of it. One moment, I'm working away, the next thing I know that there's a lapse of time I can't account for and I'm trying to piece together what happened. Of course, I'll never remember that brief period. All seizures are different and not everyone will have the exact same every single time. Sometimes I “space out”, sometimes I'll mumble, and other times well, even carry on what I was doing. This is just a snapshot of two of the many different types of seizures that exist. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="2674259"> If somebody told me about those symptoms a year ago, I would not have associated them with epilepsy at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674260">In recognition of a day like Purple Day, giving it official recognition across the country will help with that awareness, and every bit of awareness of fellow members of our community will help bring us closer and allow us to help each other better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674261">Another aspect of awareness of different kinds of seizures is to help people who are suffering from seizures with safety during the seizure and also help support them when they come out of a seizure. Often when people come out of seizures, they are confused. They might be scared because they do not remember what happened and they have to figure out where they are now that the seizure is over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674262">I would like to again quote from my friend, Kim, about the stigma that is connected with seizures. This is the second thing about awareness, not only when somebody is having a seizure or right afterward and learning what to do, but learning how to live with other members of the community who have epilepsy and recognizing that they are just like everybody else. There is a couple of things they cannot do. They need special care for a few minutes sometimes, or longer, but we really have to avoid the stigma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674263">To understand what that stigma can mean, I would like to quote from Kim McFarlane again. She suffered from epilepsy as a young child, just like the person who is responsible for this bill, Cassidy Megan, a resident of the constituency of <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I remember the first time I ever directly felt the stigma attached to epilepsy. I was in grade 6 rehearsing for our spring play, when at the moment that it was my turn to say my lines; I had an absence seizure in front of everyone. Since I wasn't saying my lines, my teacher thought I must have been defiant. She threatened to send me to the office if I didn't answer her....[T]hat day still sticks with me. There have been many other instances, too, where I've heard comments over the years, including more recently, which one could describe as ignorant. Imagine if you will hearing someone refer to the second hand of a clock as something that looks like it's having a seizure; or standing in Dundas Square in Toronto watching hip hop/breakdancers and hearing 2 guys behind you say they “look like they are having seizures”; or watching one of your favourite reality shows, and a judge refers to a contestant's dance piece as though he's having a seizure because the body movements were a little crazy and all over the place. This is only a smidgen of things I've heard, and I'm only one person. Other times people just automatically assume that because I said the word “epilepsy” or the word “seizure”--they start panicking and think I must have tonic-clonic seizures and that I will convulse on the ground because this is the only type of seizure that is typically portrayed on primetime shows. However, the reality is I'd rather someone stop and ask me questions, than just make assumptions. It's better to become educated than to remain ignorant. The point of Purple Day is about raising awareness, about education, and about eliminating the stigma that is attached to epilepsy. As long as that stigma remains, many with the disorder will not disclose or talk about it for fear of backlash and prejudice.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="2674266">That is one of the purposes of designating March 26 as Purple Day, to deal with the stigma and to educate people. It is also an opportunity to tell people about some famous people who have also suffered from epilepsy. I draw today from a speech which my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation> gave. He mentioned a number of famous people who suffered from epilepsy: Dostoevsky and Neil Young, artists; FloJo, Florence Griffith Joyner, the athlete; Margaux Hemingway and Danny Glover, actors; and Pope Pius IX.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674267">Purple Day is a chance to tell children especially that there are many very accomplished people in history and in the world who are co-sufferers of epilepsy. Maybe even “suffering” is the wrong word to use in some cases; it is just part of who they are. They are not somebody different; they are not outside the mainstream of society. That is another opportunity we would have, if we were to make Purple Day a national day of recognition and awareness.</ParaText>

If 1 in 100 Canadians have epilepsy, statistically speaking, how many Members of Parliament, Senators, staff members, and all of their family and friends, have this neurological disorder? Help bring epilepsy out of the shadows by not only supporting Bill C-278 and asking questions instead of making assumptions, but by encouraging discussion, dialogue, and awareness not only here on Parliament Hill, but also in your own constituencies.</QuotePara>

I am grateful to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="5120448" Type="4">C-278</Document>, introduced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, which promotes epilepsy awareness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674271">The bill calls on the Government of Canada to establish each March 26 as Purple Day in Canada. Every year on March 26, people would be encouraged to wear the colour purple to indicate their support for those living with epilepsy and to raise awareness of this serious condition. Any opportunity we have to raise awareness of this important health issue and its causes is worthy of consideration. There are many reasons for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674272">Almost 190,000 Canadians are living with epilepsy, a number growing by almost 15,000 every year, many of whom are in my home riding of Oshawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674273">I was diagnosed and grew up with petit mal epilepsy. I know what it is like to deal with this condition. People living with epilepsy experience brief recurring seizures that can pose serious harm. Epilepsy can begin at any age, but new cases are most common among children and older adults. While many strides have been made in addressing epilepsy, much remains to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674274">Socially, people with epilepsy can suffer from the stigma associated with it because there is little understanding about the nature of the disease. At times, people with epilepsy can also face difficulty finding employment or even obtaining private health insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674275">To underscore the challenges of living with epilepsy, we need only listen to the stories of our fellow Canadians, like Norm Beam from Niagara Falls, Ontario. Mr. Beam said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674281">Mr. Beam's and Mr. Cunningham's stories are but two examples of the countless challenges that Canadians with epilepsy face every day. As such, we must do more to raise awareness about epilepsy. In doing so, we can decrease the stigma faced by epileptics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674282">Epileptic seizures are classified as a neurological condition caused by sudden, brief electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. This condition can be separated into two types, idiopathic epilepsy and symptomatic epilepsy. Idiopathic epilepsy accounts for 60% of cases. It cannot be prevented. Its cause is unknown. Symptomatic epilepsy, also known as secondary epilepsy, the kind I was diagnosed with, can be caused by brain damage during birth, strokes, brain infections, brain tumours and severe brain injuries caused by accidents. All of these factors can contribute to epileptic seizures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674283">Research shows greater occurrences of epilepsy in children and seniors. For example, nearly a quarter of new seizure cases occur after the age of 60. One contributing factor in this case is a greater risk of injuries stemming from falls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674284">Studies show that children and seniors have a greater chance of incurring head injuries, which as I mentioned can cause secondary epilepsy. As such, activities that address supportive environments and injury prevention must be embraced. The Government of Canada is doing just that. For example, the government supports initiatives that enable both young and old to live safely and actively. It promotes active and safe routes to school, age-friendly communities and a broad range of injury prevention efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674285">The government has also provided $5 million to address sports and recreational injuries among children and youth through the active and safe injury prevention initiative.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674286">This initiative draws attention to the importance of safety and precaution in recreational activities while encouraging children and youth to be active. While these positive initiatives are making a difference from a prevention perspective, there remains a lack of information about epilepsy that must be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674287">That is why, in collaboration with Canada's major neurological charities, the government has implemented a four year $15 million population study. This study will determine the rates of neurological conditions in Canada and the effects of these conditions on individuals, families and caregivers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674288">The study involves the assistance of 25 neurological health charities, including Neurological Health Charities Canada and the Canadian Epilepsy Alliance. Data from the study will be used to better understand and meet the needs of Canadians affected by these conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674289">In addition, the government has invested more than $44 million in epilepsy-specific research since 2006, through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR. Funding for this research comes through the Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction, as well as the Institute of Human Development, Child and Youth Health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674290">This research is crucial. It helps create new understanding about how we can build understanding and awareness of the impact of genetics on epilepsy, how epilepsy affects brain development, and what types of interventions can improve the quality of care and well-being for those living with epilepsy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674291">This knowledge is filling the gaps related to epilepsy that can be used to inform policies and programs and to help improve the health of Canadians. While research is key, continued action from all sectors is also critical. Right now, communities across Canada are taking action to raise awareness about epilepsy and injury prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674292">Our international partners are also taking a higher profile stance on this issue. The World Health Organization is leading a global campaign to raise awareness and provide better information about epilepsy. Together, global partners, including Canada, are building a stronger evidence base. We are strengthening and sharing our knowledge. Collectively, we are making great strides in advancing these efforts. But we can do even more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674293">The Canadian Epilepsy Alliance, CEA, a national support and information network, has been leading efforts to gain Canadian and international support for Purple Day. Last March, the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> recognized March as National Epilepsy Month. By drawing further attention to this issue and by declaring March 26 as Purple Day, the government will take a leadership role in these awareness raising efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674294">Before I close, I want to take a moment to offer some considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674295">The best possible path for all Canadians is to take precautions in prevention and treatment. First, proper health care and treatment is essential. Individuals with epilepsy need to ensure they seek medical advice and take their medications as directed. Even missing a dose can cause a seizure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674296">Additionally, those with other medical complications compounding their epilepsy must take care to ensure their medications and dosages are well managed. For people living with epilepsy, it is important to ensure their family, friends and colleagues know how to respond appropriately in the event of a seizure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674297">Taking precautions to prevent injuries is a shared role. We can all help to provide a safe environment. Whether we are driving, swimming, or at home, we should always be mindful of potential dangers such as falls. We would do well to remember that it is possible to prevent some forms of epilepsy by taking precautions. For example, wearing helmets helps prevent head injuries, which in turn can prevent secondary epilepsy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674298">For those with epilepsy, managing it well can help ensure a full life and the ability to participate in many activities. There is hope for a cure and there is hope for those living with this condition. I am evidence of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674299">Bill <Document DbId="5120448" Type="4">C-278</Document> represents a progressive step forward in raising awareness of epilepsy. It also lets epileptics know that they are not alone. By supporting this bill, we would officially enshrine in law every March 26 as Purple Day. This would increase Canadians' awareness of epilepsy and its causes. It would enable us to better support people living with epilepsy and to better understand the link between epilepsy and injury prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674300">I encourage all members to support the bill. I am confident it would make great strides toward improving the quality of life for those living with epilepsy and their families. I know this bill is extremely important to many families in Oshawa who have loved ones who suffer from epilepsy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674301">Again, I thank the hon. member for bringing this important issue forward for our consideration so that we can all ensure that this happens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674303">I was not very familiar with this issue. In preparing to address the House, I realized that I did not know very much about epilepsy. Other members may also lack awareness, as I did. This proves that this bill and a day to raise awareness are important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674304">March 26, the day proposed to this House for raising public awareness, would be called Purple Day. We often hear criticism of awareness campaigns. Some supporters say that raising awareness does not solve the problem and is merely a symbolic gesture that could seem meaningless. I would argue otherwise and stress the importance of raising awareness. That is why we support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674305">I said at the outset that there is a lack of understanding of illnesses such as epilepsy. This proves that it is important to raise awareness. This illness is not well understood and is also unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of the seizures that makes it so difficult for people to understand this illness. The unpredictable nature of epilepsy also makes it hard for caregivers, for example. I will come back to this point a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674306">I would like to start with a very simple suggestion. The NDP members will make this suggestion in committee. I am talking about very minor changes that are backed by the organization Épilepsie Montréal métropolitain. These are changes to the French version that will improve the French. We would like to substitute “Journée lavande” for “Journée pourpre”. Thus, “couleur pourpre” would become “couleur lavande”. In addition, the term “condition” would be used instead of “maladie” in describing epilepsy in order to better represent the situation of people who suffer from epilepsy. As I mentioned, these changes are supported by Épilepsie Montréal métropolitain, more specifically Aurore Therrien, the executive director of this organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674307">It seems obvious to me that the epilepsy community and the various agencies that work in this field support this bill. I am thinking about the director of the epilepsy clinic and epilepsy research group at the Sainte-Justine Hospital, Lionel Carmant. He fully supports Purple Day and he does not see anything else wrong with the bill. He thinks there are many other opportunities. He adds that the bill should receive media coverage and that we should address the discrimination that people with epilepsy suffer at work and in many other areas of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674308">I think this shows once again the importance of awareness and the impact it can have in society. Even though this is a symbolic gesture, it launches very important work that can result in major progress and breakthroughs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674309">I think all parties in the House support bills on work toward possible medical breakthroughs. I think we all consider matters of health to be important. These are non-partisan issues. Here we are looking not only at raising awareness, but also at medical initiatives that could result in treatments. I am no expert, but based on what I have learned in the past few days, this illness is not properly understood according to current data. For example, there are surgeries available, but very few people with this illness undergo surgery, even though in many cases it would improve matters.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674310">The same is true of the various medications available. That is a more general and very important issue that MPs have tried to grapple with recently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674311">Let us talk about medication shortages and availability. Epilepsy medications are less readily available because companies make relatively little money on them. That makes them harder to come by. This situation has made people more aware of this problem, and they want solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674312">There is no doubt that the House would be willing to consider the problem of medication availability. If society were aware of this problem, that would help us deal with the issue. Members of the House, including parliamentary secretaries, ministers and committee members, could keep working on this issue. That is another important reason to support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674313">With respect to raising awareness, consider family caregivers. I had a very touching, very interesting conversation that was very difficult for me. My colleagues will understand why. While I was at a grocery store in my riding over the holidays, I ran into a family friend who lives in my riding. His wife, a family friend, passed away in September. She had a malignant brain tumour. During the final months of her life, the family had a very hard time dealing with the situation. Their experience is relevant to this discussion because we are talking about the problems that people with neurological diseases face. Of course, the severity of the disease varies from one person to the next—cancer is not the same thing as epilepsy, but it does affect neurological functions, which can be very difficult for loved ones. People with cancer and those with epilepsy have somewhat similar experiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674314">Out of respect for this man, who is one of my constituents and also a friend and a friend of my family, I will not name him. During our conversation, he spoke at length about the importance of family caregivers. He talked about how much a bill like this could have helped not only his wife, but also him and his family, who made sacrifices in terms of their jobs and the time they spent trying to create a positive environment for their loved one. In this case, they were trying to make the most of her final days. In my opinion, it is just as relevant in non-terminal cases, as with epilepsy for instance, to create an environment in which the person can function normally and feel less stigmatized, which is one of the consequences of living with an illness that not everyone understands. In such cases, awareness is very important and can be a first step towards financing and understanding family caregivers, who are a very important part of health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674315">Family caregivers and the resources available to them are at the crux of the matter. People often lack resources and are misunderstood. Medication can help people live day to day, support them at work and enhance their emotional or social well-being, but it starts with public awareness. I cannot emphasize this enough. It is an important gesture that may seem symbolic from the outside, but it is a first step in the right direction for our society and all Canadians, in order to improve the living conditions of people who are living with a very difficult illness. I commend them and congratulate them because, from what I have read over the past few days, life is not easy for them. They are working very hard to get legislation like this passed.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="170662" Type="2">Mr. Leon Benoit (Vegreville—Wainwright, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2674316">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to support Bill <Document DbId="5120448" Type="4">C-278</Document>, which promotes awareness about epilepsy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674317"> I would like to commend and thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation> who brought this bill forward. He probably had a dozen other choices that he could have debated in a private member's bill or motion, but he chose this issue because he felt it was important. I commend him for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674318">Bill <Document DbId="5120448" Type="4">C-278</Document> seeks to establish March 26 each year in Canada as Purple Day. As part of Purple Day, Canadians would be encouraged to wear something purple to indicate their support for people living with epilepsy. By supporting Bill C-278, we can show our dedication to raising awareness of epilepsy, which would lead to a greater acceptance and understanding of this condition. This increase in information and awareness could lead, and often does lead, to greater action taken by governments, by individuals, by society in general to help make life just a bit better for those with a certain condition, in this case, epilepsy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674319">I tabled a motion, and the second hour of debate on it is coming up, which deals with making more information available for those who are in the advanced stages of MS, multiple sclerosis, and are considering whether to go somewhere to have the so-called liberation therapy treatment. Because it is not available in Canada, my motion seeks to provide information about other places people could go to have this treatment and to provide information about what the process involves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674320">One of the benefits of my motion, perhaps its greatest benefit, would be to raise awareness, as the member's private member's bill raises awareness, and to garner support and in the end, help make people's lives a bit easier. I commend the member for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674321">Credit for Purple Day and this bill is owed to a special young Canadian. Her noble efforts should be applauded. Cassidy Megan, a young girl from Nova Scotia, was seven years old when she had her first epileptic attack. Her own questions and struggles with this condition led her to suggest that countries worldwide should take steps to recognize the many challenges of living with epilepsy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674322">As a way of doing this, Cassidy came up with the idea of Purple Day. The choice of the colour purple has a broad significance. The lavender flower, representing purple on the colour spectrum, is internationally recognized as the symbol of epilepsy. It represents the feelings of isolation that many people affected with epilepsy and seizure disorders often feel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674323">I can say very honestly that I know very little about epilepsy. That is part of the reason I commend the member for bringing this bill forward, in that I have learned a little. However, I know about having a child who has lived with a lot of isolation because of a condition that the child is living with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674324">Our youngest daughter was born with a moderate hearing impairment. All through her life in many situations she simply did not know what was going on around her. Even in a crowd she was isolated because she just did not know. Our daughter never complained about that. She never let it hold her back. She became an engineer. She has a great job. She got married last summer. She is doing very well in spite of this condition. However, as a parent, seeing the isolation and the pain that this caused her certainly has led me to understand the importance of trying to help those who have conditions that really do make them feel isolated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674325">I believe that the greater understanding brought about because of this bill will, through understanding and acceptance, lead to a little less isolation on the part of people suffering from epilepsy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674326">Back to Cassidy and epilepsy. Cassidy's motivation for starting Purple Day is inspiring and her own personal story is making an impact. For instance, the Canadian Epilepsy Association is now working to have Purple Day endorsed by the World Health Organization and the United Nations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674327">Purple Day is a way to get people to talk about epilepsy. We must do all we can to recognize this condition and raise awareness of its associated challenges. By doing so, we are letting people living with epilepsy know that they are really not alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674328">For anyone unfamiliar with epilepsy, let me take a few moments to explain what it is and why it needs our attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674329"> Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological conditions in Canada. Epilepsy affects more than 50 million Canadians worldwide. In Canada, nearly 190,000 people live with epilepsy. This number grows by more than 50,000 every year. The World Health Organization has declared that epilepsy is the most common serious brain disorder globally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674330">One of the hallmarks of this disease is the brief recurring seizures experienced by epileptics. These mild to severe seizures often occur when nerve cells or neurons in the brain send out the wrong signals. When having a seizure, an epileptic may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Due to the perceived stigma associated with epilepsy, many with the disorder are reluctant to report having it or to seek treatment, so the number of those affected may be even higher than the reported numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674331">The most common known causes of epilepsy result from injuries resulting from a brain tumour, head trauma, substance abuse or serious infection. However, in more than half of all epileptic cases, the cause simply remains unknown. That said, many Canadians living with epilepsy enjoy productive lives, but living with this condition still presents challenges for patients, their families and for society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674332">Some of these challenges include physical hazards related to unpredictable seizures, social exclusion and other forms of stigma. It can also affect participation in key aspects of life, including communities, schools, employment and leisure. Raising awareness about epilepsy is part of confronting the condition and its challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674333"> By supporting this bill and enshrining Purple Day into law, we build on initiatives already in place to enhance the understanding of epilepsy in Canada. For example, March is recognized as National Epilepsy Month. In March Canadians are encouraged to learn more about epilepsy and to help foster a national focus on a discussion of the condition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674334">In addition, the Government of Canada works in tandem with its key partners to help us better prepare to meet the needs of those living with neurological conditions, including epilepsy. Furthermore, I am pleased to say that the Government of Canada has invested $15 million over four years in a national population study of neurological conditions, working with major neurological health charities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674335"> Raising awareness about epilepsy is exactly what Bill <Document DbId="5120448" Type="4">C-278</Document> is all about and I have talked about why that is important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674336">On a final note, I would like to close with some words from Cassidy Megan. As Cassidy said in a recent public message:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2674340">Madam Speaker, first, I would like to commend the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation> for introducing this very important bill and, particularly the founder of Purple Day, Cassidy Megan, and her family for their excellent work. This is a great example of involvement and commitment that can bring about change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674341">I am pleased to participate in a debate on an issue as important as a condition that has such a major impact on Canadians and their families. Unfortunately, I must apologize to those who suffer from epilepsy because our government and we politicians have not done enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674342">Let us look at the situation. Today, in 2012, 30% of patients do not respond to the treatments that are currently available. This figure shows how necessary it is to produce new anti-epileptic drugs, improve access to global epilepsy assessment and treatment programs and increase funding for research in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674343">One in four people has seizures that cannot be controlled with anti-epileptic drugs. Surgery is an option for nearly half of these people. Dr. Valiente noted that, in Ontario, 10,000 people with epilepsy could benefit from brain surgery but only 2% have the operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674344"> According to a briefing note about anti-epileptic drug shortages by the Canadian Epilepsy Alliance, drug manufacturers are not in any rush to address the current shortages, which largely affect lower-cost generic drugs with small profit margins. That is shameful. The shortage of drugs used to treat epilepsy can have serious consequences that can reduce the quality of life of those with the condition and even put their lives at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674345">I sympathize with the people who have this illness because this situation is unacceptable and even deplorable. We must take action and that is why I support this bill. Even though this bill does not necessarily focus on access to medication, I support it because it will make Canadians more aware of epilepsy. However, my party is still calling upon the government to deliver concrete results for Canadians in matters of health. Canadians deserve more than empty words. The government can and must do more to help Canadians with epilepsy and their loved ones. The NDP is advocating and asking for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674346">Indeed, members opposite and all members of this Parliament are speaking eloquently about the challenges people with epilepsy face, but previous governments had no plan to help these people. I wonder if all members are going to pressure this government to implement measures such as help for caregivers and employment assistance measures for people in difficult situations. We know that a number of people with epilepsy are also under-employed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674347">Is this government going to take the drug shortage seriously? This shortage has devastating effects on people with epilepsy. Previous Liberal governments were no better. The Liberals were in power for 13 years and had a majority government for 11 of those years. They did not increase public awareness about epilepsy and did not help those with epilepsy fight discrimination, which is still far too common. Purple Day was created in 2008, when the Liberals no longer formed the government. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2674348">We know that this condition affects many Canadians and has serious repercussions on their lives and their families' lives. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases in the world and affects almost 300,000 people in Canada and 50 million people worldwide. Epilepsy can also have profound physical, psychological and social repercussions and its impact on quality of life is sometimes worse than other chronic diseases. It is believed that certain factors can contribute to this situation, including the unpredictability of the episodes and the social stigma associated with epilepsy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674349">People with epilepsy are more likely to have low self-esteem, to be depressed and even to commit suicide. This illness can also have repercussions on a person's education, job opportunities, independence, and the ability to drive or get a driver's licence. These very difficult conditions have to be taken into account by this government and future governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674350">More than 30% of patients do not respond to current treatments and suffer unpredictable seizures. This highlights the need to manufacture new anti-epileptic drugs, improve access to comprehensive programs to fight this condition and increase funding for research. We cannot eradicate this illness without research. That is what we on this side of the House and the experts who agree with us are asking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674351"> Together with the experts, I fully support Purple Day to raise public awareness of epilepsy. The Canadian Epilepsy Alliance and its 25 member organizations are strong supporters of Bill <Document DbId="5120448" Type="4">C-278</Document>. Dr. Lionel Carmant, director of the epilepsy clinic and the epilepsy research group at Sainte-Justine Hospital and a professor in the pediatrics department at Université de Montreal, fully supports Purple Day. He does not see any other errors in the bill. He also believes that there other opportunities: obtain media coverage for the bill and tackle discrimination against people with epilepsy in the workplace and in other areas of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674352">I completely agree with that. The Epilepsy Support Centre in London, Ontario, said that it is critical to build public awareness of epilepsy because people with the illness can face social stigmatization. Information is still the best way to raise public awareness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674353">Épilepsie Montréal Métropolitain also supports the bill wholeheartedly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674354">Lastly, I would like to remind Canadians of the NDP's position. We support this bill because it would raise awareness among Canadians. We are asking the government to take responsibility for delivering real results for people with epilepsy. The government can and should do more to ensure that medications are available. Let us end the stigmatization of Canadians suffering from this illness.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2674356">Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for bringing up this important legislation. More awareness is needed for people dealing with epilepsy. If we choose to look the other way on this important issue, we will be turning our backs on 300,000 Canadians who live with epilepsy every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674357">A young girl from Nova Scotia took it upon herself to create purple day in 2008. She was only nine years-old, but she was motivated by her own struggles with epilepsy. In 2009, the day was created internationally, and now 35 countries recognize the importance of raising awareness of this condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674358">Epilepsy is not a small issue: it affects about 1 in every 100 people in Canada. That makes this condition the second most common neurological disorder after migraines. It is more common than muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and Parkinson's disease combined. Epilepsy may begin at any age, but the most common occurrence is in young children and the elderly over 65. They are our most vulnerable citizens and should not be forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674359">Purple day helps remove the stigma of a very common condition. In the developing countries of our planet, 60% to 90% of people living with epilepsy receive no treatment due to social stigma. Our country must set an example with people wearing purple on March 26 in order to remove the stigma of this common condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674360">People with epilepsy have been shown to have an increased risk of poor self-esteem, leading to depression, which can lead to higher rates of suicide. The House has been debating suicide prevention for some time now, and it is time to take concrete actions to undo the stigma and provide further health care for those who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674361">Epilepsy also adversely affects an individual's education and employment opportunities. As a government, we need to create possibilities for job growth in our country. Under this government, employment opportunities have been getting worse for average Canadians, so the disadvantaged are less likely to be employed and are more likely to sink into depression. Measures should be taken to fight discrimination against any Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2674362">Raising awareness to overcome stigmas is extremely important, but raising awareness also means speaking about the shortages in health care. An important point is that about 70% of people with epilepsy respond to current treatments. That is a good thing, but it also means that 30% do not respond to the currently available treatments. These people continue to experience uncontrollable seizures.</ParaText>
