The House resumed from March 28 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</Document>, be read the third time and passed.

            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170153" Type="2">Ms. Irene Mathyssen (London—Fanshawe, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3333671">Mr. Speaker, the New Democratic Party believes that we must seriously address the issue of nuclear security and comply with our international obligation in order to better co-operate with other countries on a counterterrorism strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333672">The bill before us is unique inasmuch as we usually oppose the introduction of a government bill through the Senate, because an unelected chamber is not the place to begin the legislative process. However, for Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>, one can see a helpful use of Senate time to do the first vetting of legislation that is intended merely to be technical to create compliance with international obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333673">This bill fulfills Canada's treaty obligations under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, CPPNM, and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, ICSANT. This includes extending international measures beyond protecting against the proliferation of nuclear materials to now include the protection of nuclear facilities. It reinforces Canada's obligation under UN Security Council resolution 1540, from 2004, to take and enforce effective measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials as well as chemical and biological weapons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333674">In this case, the implementation of the treaty requires amendments to Canadian legislation. The treaty is ratified only when such amendments or new legislation have been passed. To date, Canada has not ratified either the ICSANT or the CPPNM amendments. This is because Canada does not have legislation in place to criminalize the offences outlined in the ICSANT or some of the offences outlined in the CPPNM.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333675">The amendments Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> introduces into the code represent Canada's efforts to align its domestic legislation with what is required by both conventions. If these amendments become law, Canada will presumably be in a position to ratify both the conventions, something Canada, and other countries, committed to work toward at both the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit, held in Washington, D.C., and the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Korea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333676">New Democrats are committed to multilateral diplomacy and international co-operation, especially in areas of great common concern, such as nuclear terrorism. We thus need to work with other leading countries that are ratifying these conventions. Moreover, Canada has agreed to be legally bound by these conventions. It is important to fulfill our international obligations and ratify these conventions through the domestic implementation that Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> undertakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333677">To emphasize the seriousness of nuclear terrorism, I wish to quote from Professor Matthew Bunn, associate professor of public policy, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard University.</ParaText>

With at least two terrorist groups having pursued nuclear weapons seriously in the last 20 years, we cannot expect that they will be the last. Moreover, some terrorists have seriously considered sabotaging nuclear power plants, perhaps causing something like what we saw at Fukushima in Japan, or dispersing highly radioactive materials in a so-called “dirty bomb”.</QuotePara>

Kofi Annan, when he was secretary-general of the United Nations, warned that the economic effects would drive millions of people into poverty and create a second [terrifyingly significant] death toll in the developing world. Fears that terrorists might have another bomb that they might set off somewhere else would be acute. The world would be transformed, and not for the better.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3333706">Mr. Speaker, ever since September 11, the international community has been worried about international terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333707">The United Nations General Assembly and Security Council have been trying to establish international co-operation to eliminate terrorism. They have paid particular attention to nuclear terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333708">The UN General Assembly and Security Council passed resolutions that resulted in treaties on nuclear terrorism, calling upon member states to pass laws and adopt policies to keep up with the constant evolution of the terrorist threat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333709">Canada has been involved in this international co-operation for a long time. Canada ratified the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which encourages countries to create measures to prevent, detect and punish crimes involving nuclear materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333710">In 2005, that convention was amended to improve physical protection for nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. These changes will increase the scope of the convention and cover nuclear materials used for peaceful purposes while in domestic use, storage and transport, as well as domestic nuclear facilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333711"> Also in 2005, Canada signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, but that convention has not yet been ratified. A treaty can be ratified only when national legislative amendments have been made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333712"> The ICSANT calls upon countries to create new criminal offences for acts of nuclear terrorism. That is the purpose of Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>. The bill will amend Canada's laws to bring them into line with the two conventions I have just mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333713"> Once this bill has been passed, Canada will be able to ratify both international conventions and thus we will fulfill our obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333714">We are in favour of multilateral approaches that encourage co-operation between countries. Such co-operation is important in so-called transnational areas of concern, such as terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333715"> International co-operation is the only way we can protect ourselves from such threats. When a problem goes beyond our borders, our national laws cannot eliminate transnational activities or protect us from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333716"> That is why it is important to establish good co-operation that leads to international conventions that make it possible to extend the limited coverage provided by our own legislation. We support co-operation among the countries that have ratified these conventions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333717"> That is why we will support this bill. Its content meets the requirements of the convention very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333718">This bill was introduced in the Senate in March. It has 10 clauses that create four new crimes to be added to the Criminal Code. The bill would make it illegal to possess, use or dispose of nuclear or radioactive material or a nuclear or radioactive device or commit an act against a nuclear facility or its operations with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm or substantial damage to property or the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333719"> It would also make it illegal to use or alter nuclear or radioactive material or a nuclear or radioactive device or commit an act against a nuclear facility or its operation with the intent to compel a person, government or international organization to do or refrain from doing anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333720"> I would like to emphasize the word "compel". It is important because the prime objective of terrorism is to force a government or organization to do something, and that can include not doing certain things as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333721">How many attacks or kidnappings have been committed by terrorist organizations in order to discourage countries from taking part in the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq? Terrorist groups use threats and retribution to force governments to give in to their political demands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333722">The bill also makes it illegal to commit an indictable offence under federal law for the purpose of obtaining nuclear or radioactive material, a nuclear or radioactive device, or access to or control of a nuclear facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333723">Protecting against someone obtaining a nuclear device may be problematic. Quite often, people who try to make a nuclear device will try to find the parts individually and, often, the parts may seem harmless because they could be used for many things. One of the biggest difficulties for the RCMP and the security service is identifying how the parts will be used.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3333724">The bill also makes it illegal to threaten to commit any of the other three offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333725">This bill makes other important amendments to the Criminal Code, for instance, to add definitions for the terms used for these new offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333726">The bill also adds a new section to the Criminal Code to ensure that individuals who commit or attempt to commit any of these offences overseas can be prosecuted in Canada. This provision contains specific criteria, however. The offence must be committed on a ship that is registered or licensed or on an aircraft registered in Canada, by a Canadian citizen or someone who is present in Canada after the commission of the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333727">This bill will amend Criminal Code provisions on electronic surveillance and the taking of bodily substances. The Anti-Terrorism Act amended the code provisions on electronic surveillance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333728">Therefore, the four new offences were added to section 183 of the Criminal Code to justify the use of electronic surveillance for these offences. This provision was included to allow peace officers to apply for a warrant for the seizure of bodily substances when they are investigating individuals for these offences. It will also be mandatory to collect bodily substances from those convicted of these offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333729">These two tools are important for our front-line public safety officers. However, these provisions will have to be used in accordance with Canadian legislation and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. When new powers are granted, limits must be set to prevent any abuse on the part of our public safety officers who, I would like to stress, have my full confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333730">Finally, the bill amends the Canadian rule regarding double jeopardy. That rule does not apply if a trial abroad does not meet certain basic Canadian legal standards. In such cases, a Canadian court may retry the person for the same crime for which he was convicted abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333731">This Senate bill enables the government to meet its international obligations by creating new Criminal Code offences, but that is just one side of the coin. The other side, which is just as important, has to do with prevention and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333732">Mr. Jamieson, from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, made a presentation before the Special Senate Committee on the Anti-terrorism Act on June 4. He gave a brief outline of the prevention provisions adopted by the commission. He explained that the requirements relating to physical protection are gradual and reflect the level of risk and its consequences. He presented a partial list of security measures in nuclear facilities. The requirements range from controlling access to sites to providing an on-site response force. Employees and supervisors must meet security protocol awareness and training requirements, and they must undergo background checks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333733">Licensees must develop and maintain contingency plans as well as practise regular emergency drills. The transport of nuclear materials requires a licence. In order to obtain it, the licensee must submit a detailed security plan including a threat assessment, the proposed security measures, the route and other arrangements along the route. Security plans are required for all shipments, including those in transit through Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333734">Canada is a model for the world when it comes to nuclear safety, but the government must continue to invest the necessary funds in order to maximize the safety of Canadians, while minimizing the likelihood of a crime or a terrorist attack being committed in Canada or elsewhere in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333735">The International Atomic Energy Agency documented nearly 2,000 incidents related to the unauthorized use, transport or possession of nuclear and radioactive materials between 1993 and 2011. Government agencies with anti-terrorism responsibilities must work in an integrated manner in order for these organizations to be able to properly protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333736">It is not just a matter of creating indictable terrorist offences. It is also a question of investing the necessary funds to allow these organizations and their front-line officers to carry out their mission and the mandate assigned to them, which is to protect the safety of Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3333745">Mr. Speaker, today I am taking part in the debate at third reading on Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</Document>, or the Nuclear Terrorism Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333746">I have a keen interest in this bill. In fact, I can identify with a number of aspects of the nuclear issue as they are related to various stages in my life. My speech might be called “slices of life”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333747"> After an innocent childhood light years away from such concerns, it was in my teen years that I realized the incredible potential of nuclear energy, although I did not immediately become aware that there were major disadvantages hidden behind its advantages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333748"> I lived in Trois-Rivières my whole life, and in the 1970s I saw the first nuclear power plant built. Gentilly-1 was an experimental plant if ever there was one, and it was the pride of Canadian technology. It promised an incredible energy future and garnered international renown for Canada’s CANDU reactors. In addition, a friend's father, who worked for Atomic Energy of Canada Limited at the time, was sent to Korea to take part in the building and start-up of nuclear power stations using Canadian technology. To my mind, nothing but good could come of this, because I knew him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333749"> Remember, it was the early 1970s, a time when we thought that, by the end of the century, we would have a four-day workweek and a leisure society and floating cars, just like in the Star Wars films. Of course, at the time we also thought finding a solution to the problem of radioactive waste would be child’s play. During my first visit to Gentilly-1, the storage ponds for uranium fuel bundles and the use of robots in the handling procedures left me feeling confident in our ability to succeed. Life is so simple when you are young.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333750"> This idyllic view of the world was shattered by my first 20th-century history courses, when films of the fallout of the Hiroshima bombing made me realize that a major scientific breakthrough could be either beneficial or destructive, depending on whose hands it fell into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333751"> During my university years in Quebec City, while travelling along the 138 by the St. Lawrence River, I noticed the construction of Gentilly-2, which was in service from 1983 until 2012, and which produced a great deal of radioactive waste that is still stored on site. All the tourists who enjoyed a cruise on the St. Lawrence at Trois-Rivières were invariably told all about these two nuclear power stations during their trip.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333752"> It was not until much later, not until the disasters at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986, that I began to be more concerned about the issue of security at these facilities. Although terrorism was not a factor in these two disasters, I found that, while security of access to the Gentilly plants by land was adequate, access by the St. Lawrence River was significantly more problematic. In fact, my fears in this regard have not yet entirely dissipated, and my opinion is the same as it was back then. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333753"> Today, however, we cannot deny the possibility of a terrorist attack. While its former international reputation made a Canadian passport the best calling card for travel throughout the world and gave us the impression that we would never be targeted by terrorist movements, since this government came to power, the global community's ideas about Canada have changed radically, and there is very little to suggest that we are still sheltered from attacks or reprisals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333754">I am somewhat encouraged to see that we are discussing a bill today that could enable Canada to meet some of its international obligations, including under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The latter would extend the application of international measures beyond protecting against the proliferation of nuclear materials to include protection of nuclear facilities. I live next to Gentilly, and our region is the only one at risk in Quebec and will be for years because even though the power plant was shut down in December, it still needs to be decommissioned and dismantled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333755">This bill could help reassure millions of Canadians like me who live near a nuclear facility. Despite the complexity of the matter and the situation, the bill is relatively easy to understand.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3333756">The bill on nuclear terrorism includes 10 clauses that create four new offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333757">This bill makes it illegal to possess, use or dispose of nuclear or radioactive material or a nuclear or radioactive device or commit an act against a nuclear facility or its operations with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm or substantial damage to property or the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333758">It made me chuckle to see a Conservative bill that even bothers to mention the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333759">The bill also makes it illegal to use or alter nuclear or radioactive material or a nuclear or radioactive device or commit an act against a nuclear facility or its operation with the intent to compel a person, government or international organization to do or refrain from doing anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333760">It also makes it illegal to commit an indictable offence under federal law for the purpose of obtaining nuclear or radioactive material, a nuclear or radioactive device, or access to or control of a nuclear facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333761">Finally, it makes it illegal to threaten to commit any of the other three offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333762">With these four new offences, this bill also makes major amendments to the code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333763">For example, one amendment would ensure that the four offences be considered primary designated offences for the purposes of issuing warrants. One provision regarding wiretapping would allow for the rules to be applied to these new offences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333764">If Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> is passed, Canada would have legislation enabling it to ratify the two international conventions I mentioned a few minutes ago. Although such a bill is necessary, we cannot ignore the fact that it raises some concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333765">As a result, we must ensure that the scope of these new sections will not lead to excessive criminalization and will not violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333766">We will continue to oppose the fact that the government is introducing bills through the Senate, because we do not think that this unelected chamber should be the starting point of our legislative process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333767">However, as New Democrats, we are determined to support multilateral diplomacy and international co-operation, particularly in areas of shared concern. That is why we will vote in favour of the bill at third reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333768">Terrorism is certainly a shared concern. Many people associate nuclear terrorism with plots from action movies such as <I>James Bond</I> or <I>Die Hard</I>. However, between 1993 and 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency identified close to 2,000 incidents related to the use, transportation and possession of nuclear and radioactive material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333769">Canada must take a leadership role to ensure that at the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit, the participants implement the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which was amended in 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333770">Canada, as well as the United States, could play an important role in making sure that happens. However, 2014 is not far off, and that is one reason why my party is supporting this bill at third reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333771">Since the September 11 attacks, Canada and the United States have tightened up security protocols surrounding their own nuclear material, to convince other countries to adopt a responsible approach to reducing the risk of theft of nuclear material and nuclear terrorism. As a result, these two countries should set an example by implementing responsible measures at home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333772">A total of 97 of the 145 countries have to ratify this treaty for it to be enforceable. Fifty-six countries have already ratified it in their parliaments. The call was put out during the Seoul summit, and we need to step up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333773">The threat is real; according to Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary-General, nuclear terrorism is one of the greatest threats we face today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333774">We do not have the right to allow incidents to happen because we did not try to guard against a terrorist attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333775">I will conclude by saying that it would be wrong not to anticipate events as tragic as those in Fukushima, which were caused by natural forces beyond our control. We cannot assume that they will not happen as a result of situations that we could have avoided.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3333776">There are two fundamental reasons why I am voting for this bill. For one, it is designed to fight potential nuclear terrorists before they strike and, two, it will help Canada regain some of the credibility it has lost internationally.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3333797">Mr. Speaker, first, I think it unfortunate that the nuclear terrorism bill has come from the Senate, a chamber where the occupants have not been democratically elected, but, rather, appointed for partisan reasons. Bills should be debated first and foremost in the House of Commons, where the elected representatives sit. That is the very principle of a parliamentary system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333798">The government was already beating all records for time allocation and closure. Now it is bringing its bills in by the back door, by way of the Senate. It is really sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333799">Let us discuss Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>, which will enable Canada to fulfill its commitments under two international conventions. These conventions are intended to go beyond the limits of nuclear non-proliferation and will now include protective measures for nuclear facilities. Bill S-9 would reinforce Canada's obligation under the 2004 UN Security Council resolution 1540 to take and enforce effective measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials as well as chemical and biological weapons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333800">According to Matthew Bunn, associate professor of public policy at Harvard University, there have been a number of cases of trafficking in since the 1990s. For example, there have been 20 seizures of highly enriched uranium since 1992. There is also a black market for less radioactive materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, has reported nearly 2,000 incidents of unauthorized use, transport, and possession of nuclear and other radioactive material between 1993 and 2011. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333801"> We must remain watchful and aware of the danger. Canada is one of the world's major producers and exporters of uranium. That means we must stockpile a great deal of radioactive and nuclear waste. That is an enormous problem, especially with the lax enforcement of regulations and prevention seen in the field. It is very difficult to contain this kind of waste. When a potential black market in radioactive material is added to this problem, we must see that the potential for nuclear terrorism is right here in Canada, under our noses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333802">My hon. colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="170604" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> told a story the other day here about L. Bélanger Métal, a large scrapyard in Trois-Rivières, that detected a very high level of radiation in certain metal beams it had received in 2012. Tests were done and they were able to determine that the metal came from Gentilly. How did this radioactive metal end up there? It is a very disturbing situation that shows how far-reaching the problem is. The greatest nuclear terrorism threat lies in the waste from Canada's nuclear reactors, which are unprotected from theft or simple negligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333803"> Nuclear terrorism does not occur in isolation but has an impact on the entire world. New Democrats agree that we must co-operate with our international partners. Historically, Canada has always had a reputation as an international leader. It is sad to see that our reputation has been quite tarnished since 2006, for example, with the new environmental policies. If we want to be serious about preventing nuclear terrorism, the first thing is to strengthen our procedures governing environmental assessment and the way we stockpile nuclear waste.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3333804">Still, I hope that Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> will help build Canada's credibility in the fight against nuclear terrorism. I also hope that, when they see us implementing this legislation here, our international partners will be inspired to follow suit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333805">The Senate committee provided many interesting comments during the long process the bill went through. First, with the development of new technologies, Canada will no longer need to use nuclear reactors and enriched uranium to produce medical isotopes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333806">The committee also believes that Canada should be a leader in nuclear safety, by committing to stop the use of highly enriched uranium for civilian purposes as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333807">Second, Canada must show greater care in its safety arrangements. Malicious people are always looking for ways to bypass existing safety features. As a result, we must remain vigilant and move to new methods focused on prevention rather than repression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333808">Another issue was raised during consideration of the bill. The justice department's intention was to stick as closely as possible to the provisions of the international convention. However, some of the new offences in the Criminal Code have a broader scope than the offences found in the international agreements. We must ensure that the overly broad scope of these new sections will not lead to excessive criminalization and will not violate the charters of rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333809">Lastly, Canada is legally bound by these international conventions, which means that we have obligations to fulfill. However, we cannot ratify the conventions until the domestic implementation process is complete. That is why I support Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>, while hoping that it will not turn out to be just something passed to court votes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3333810">We need to do more in terms of securing sites, creating protocols and implementing storage solutions that will not become a burden for future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3333853">Al Gore recently insulted these people, when he accused them of using our atmosphere as an "open sewer". Look who is talking. Gore recently stuffed his pockets with $70 million of oil money when he sold his low-rated television network to dictators in petro-state Qatar. Human Rights Watch says that low-paid migrant workers have their passports confiscated there so that they cannot escape Qatar's overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, which lack potable water. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3333875">I say “yacht”, but does that mean it is a yacht? No one knows. The worst is that the government's only solution to prevent this from happening again is to stop following up on spending after 2010. It is not silly if you think about it. It is rather brilliant, since if you do not track how money is spent, it is technically impossible to lose it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334116">Mr. Speaker, I have a petition asking the House of Commons to formally condemn discrimination against females occurring through sex-selective pregnancy termination. The petitioners draw to our attention the fact that in Canada ultrasounds are being used to tell the sex of unborn children and parents are choosing to terminate the pregnancy if the unborn child is a girl. They ask all parties to condemn that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334117">Petitioners point to the fact that 92% of Canadians believe sex-selective pregnancy termination should be illegal. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada vehemently opposes sex selection. Millions of girls have been lost through sex-selective abortion, creating a global gender imbalance and causing girls to be trafficked into prostitution. Petitioners reiterate that Parliament should condemn this worst form of discrimination against females by condemning sex-selective abortions. </ParaText>

It is unclear to what degree the proposal would induce individuals to travel more or change their travel plans, but any increase in eligible travel would increase the cost of the proposal. As an example, if the number of eligible travelers would increase by 25% as a result of the proposal, the cost would increase to about $270 million.

              <ParaText id="3334174">I spoke to the bill at second reading, at which time I supported the bill in principle. Essentially, the bill was not amended in committee and several witnesses reminded us of the importance of its swift passage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334175">Before quoting some very enlightening testimony heard at committee, I would like to remind the House what Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> is all about. Quite simply, it amends the Criminal Code to create new offences allowing us to better foil certain activities related to nuclear terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334176">Among other things, the bill makes it illegal to possess, use or dispose of nuclear or radioactive material or commit an act against a nuclear facility or its operations, with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm or substantial damage to property or the environment; to use or alter a nuclear or radioactive device or commit an act against a nuclear facility or its operations with the intent to compel a person, government or international organization to do or refrain from doing anything; to commit an indictable offence under federal law for the purpose of obtaining nuclear or radioactive material, or access to a nuclear facility; and to threaten to commit any of the other three offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334177">The bill also has a prevention component to it. As Terry Jamieson, vice-president of the Technical Support Branch of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, told the committee:</ParaText>

But if the United States and Canada are to succeed in convincing other countries to take a responsible approach to reducing the risks of nuclear theft and terrorism at the Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands in 2014 and beyond, then our two countries have to take the lead in taking responsible action ourselves.</QuotePara>

We must put our words into action and deliver a clear message to the international community. Speaking of sending a clear message, our neighbours to the south have yet to approve similar legislation. Hopefully, between now and nuclear safety week in 2014, they will be inspired by our example to ratify the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the CPPNM amendment and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</ParaText>

In the case of highly enriched uranium, making such a bomb is basically a matter of slamming two pieces together at high speed. The amounts required are small, and smuggling them is frighteningly easy. </QuotePara>

With at least two terrorist groups having pursued nuclear weapons seriously in the last 20 years, we cannot expect that they will be the last. Moreover, some terrorists have seriously considered sabotaging nuclear power plants, perhaps causing something like what we saw at Fukushima in Japan, or dispersing highly radioactive materials in a so-called “dirty bomb”. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3334208">In fact, no amendments to this bill were adopted in committee. Nevertheless, we believe that the bill is commendable.

              <ParaText id="3334209">I would remind the House that the bill is basically punitive. It increases the length of sentences and the number of criminal offences in the Criminal Code.

              <ParaText id="3334210">My colleague raised another interesting point. The parliamentary committees do indeed do essential work. Witnesses and experts therefore need to come and give evidence, something that the Conservatives have refused to allow in other committees.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334211">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</Document> and the Nuclear Terrorism Act. This bill puts in place legislative measures to comply with the criminal law requirements contained in two international counterterrorism treaties: the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, amended in 2005, and the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334212">The NDP and I myself believe that we must seriously address the issue of nuclear safety and comply with our international obligations, in order to better co-operate with other countries on a nuclear counterterrorism strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334213">The danger remains very real. It is therefore very important that we implement these UN treaties. Even though we normally oppose a government bill that is introduced through the Senate, Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> is important enough that we can understand that it is worthwhile for the Senate to do the first vetting of legislation that is intended merely to be technical in order to create compliance with international legislation. It is very important for me as a member of the NDP that we comply with our obligations in the international arena. We are determined to promote multilateral diplomacy and international co-operation, particularly in areas of shared concern, such as nuclear terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334214"> Because Canada has already agreed to be legally bound by these conventions, it is important to fulfill our international obligations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334215"> It is good to see that the government is taking action to comply with these international treaties and conventions. We must of course note that the elements in the bill are in response to these 2005 treaties. It is a bit late in the day to be doing this, but we are used to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334216"> This bill was tabled in the Senate on March 27, and moved very slowly. The government brought it before the House sporadically, and only in order to fill gaps in its program. This is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334217"> As I was saying, the intent of Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> is to comply with Canada’s international obligations, but it is still a breath of fresh air in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334218"> I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of this House to Canada’s other international responsibilities that are still waiting to be dealt with by this government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334219"> It is very relevant, in fact, given that the United Nations Universal Periodic Review was just tabled in late April 2013. The report points out that the Committee against Torture has urged Canada to incorporate the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in its law, so that its provisions can be invoked directly before a court of law and so that the Convention be given precedence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334220"> Unfortunately, Canada has not been moving on this file. It is nevertheless part of the same process to amend our statutes to fulfill our international responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334221"> Torturing human beings ought not to be allowed here or anywhere else. Even so, we have not yet ratified the treaty here in the House, despite our international agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334222"> Moreover, the Committee Against Torture remains concerned by the fact that Canadian law, particularly subsection 115(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, continues to provide exceptions to the principle of non-refoulement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334223"> Are the Conservatives moving this file forward? No. Instead, they are pushing their bits and pieces of legislation through the back door in the form of private member’s bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334224"> These bills runs completely counter to what the international community is asking of us. By possibly endangering these people—whether by returning them without review, imprisoning and sometimes separating them from their children, or even by making them stateless—this government is once again violating international obligations and its obligations to its own citizens.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334225"> Unfortunately, that is not all. The Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Canada find a constitutional way of providing a comprehensive national legal framework that fully integrates the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334226"> Once again, we are at a standstill on this matter. All Canadians are very unhappy about it. It is yet another convention left for dead by the people on the other side of the House, yet children are our future, and the rights of children need to be protected unconditionally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334227"> On that note, I would also like to point out that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination strongly urged Canada, in consultation with aboriginal peoples, to consider adopting a national action plan to enforce the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334228"> Many allied countries have questioned Canada on this matter, including New Zealand, Australia and Sweden. Unfortunately, as we heard yesterday in the committee of the whole with the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation>, the Conservatives' approach to aboriginal rights is paternalistic, improvised and partisan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334229"> Owing to the absence of any real consultations with aboriginal communities, to use the language of the minister himself, and of course their cavalier way of handling claims by aboriginal peoples, it is impossible to believe that the Conservatives want a harmonious relationship. They also do not really want to comply with international laws in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334230"> The community of Kanesatake, which I represent, is suffering seriously from this lack of vision. Whether because of its lack of openness and consultation, its chronic underfunding of education and other areas, or its abysmal management of land claims, the Conservative government gives the appearance of really working against Kanesatake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334231"> I would like to know whether my government colleagues are aware that the Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged Canada to pass laws that would bring it into compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, and to amend its legislation to ensure that information on the date and place of birth of adopted children and their biological parents is retained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334232"> This is a short list of important actions Canada needs to take with respect to the federal government's international obligations, whether in terms of co-operating with other countries and the UN or developing laws, in order to continue to be a world leader. Only then would we be in a position to leave a legacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334233"> We saw this already with Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>, on which action was very slow indeed. Action should really have been much faster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334234"> Unfortunately, as I just mentioned, it was introduced in the Senate, but we are going to support it because it is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334235"> I would nevertheless like to point to the government's lack of motivation to implement international agreements. I would certainly never say that one is less important than the other, but in this instance, the bill on nuclear terrorism was of course chosen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334236"> For many years, the process to eliminate discrimination against aboriginal peoples and to provide genuine assistance for aboriginal women was delayed. That process is stalled now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334237"> To conclude, I would like to reiterate that I will support this bill, which brings in legislative measures to comply with the criminal law requirements in the two international treaties on combatting terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334238"> I sincerely hope that the government will comply with the treaty requirements in those areas I spoke about today.</ParaText>

This is an example of a bill that we are not necessarily prepared to support. Although its objective is very commendable, the way that it is written and the negative impacts it may have could be enough to stop us from supporting it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334242">The fact that the purpose of a bill is commendable does not mean that we are necessarily going to support it. We must go much further than that before making a decision. My colleague is very involved in women's issues. I commend her for that, and I commend her for her speech.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334244">Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> implements measures consistent with international commitments that we support. This is therefore very important. Even if we have concerns, it is more important to co-operate at the international level so that we can advance within the international community. Canada is a very important player on the international scene. What we do here with our laws can reflect these agreements, and it is very important to set an example for other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334245">The case of Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> is completely different. As I mentioned, many countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Sweden, are calling for us to do something for aboriginal women. None of them have told us that Bill <Document DbId="5138145" Type="3">S-2</Document> is a step in the right direction, since the bill creates more problems than it solves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334246">Countries around the world are trying to help us and encourage us to prevent violence and racial discrimination against aboriginal women, and it is sad that our government has been ignoring these issues because it wants to play petty politics.

              <ParaText id="3334260">Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> would amend the Criminal Code to implement criminal law requirements found in two international counterterrorism treaties: the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. By passing the bill, Canada will fulfill its international obligations under these treaties and will be legally bound by them. Passing the bill will allow Canada to finally ratify these conventions, putting us in line with our international partners. We need to be working with other leading countries that are moving toward ratifying these conventions, and passing Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> will go a long way in doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334261">As a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development for the past years, I have had a front-row seat to witness the Conservatives' view of the world and how they choose to deal with other countries. They have taken an abrasive approach to diplomacy, while calling it “principled”, but act more like a confused bull in a fine China shop than diplomats or simply fellow citizens of the earth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334262">We have seen the Conservatives pull out of the UN's desertification conventions for reasons, to be polite, that were questionable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334263"> We have seen them send out ministers of the Crown to berate one of the UN's special rapporteurs for pointing out the fact that we have a food security problem in many parts of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334264">We then saw the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> ignore multiple requests from three other UN special rapporteurs for 15 months before finally answering while presenting at the UN's Universal Periodic Review on Human Rights. I am sure that the timing of that announcement was the purest of pure coincidences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334265">Then, for the final <I>coup de grâce</I>, we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> that Canada would not even attempt to win a seat on the UN Security Council because our defeat was so certain. To put that into perspective, under the Conservative government we have gone from never losing an election for a Security Council seat to not even trying because we are so sure to lose that election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334266">This is a serious decline in our international standing in a very short period of time. We need to ask ourselves why this is happening, because this is not the Canada I knew.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334267">That is not the Canada I knew, a Canada that had a definite role and definite influence on the international scene. That is not the Canada we have now under the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334268">The Conservatives will try to tell us that none of that really matters and that their approach will not have any serious consequences. I challenge the Conservative members who serve on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development to go to Montreal and meet the thousands of people who work at the International Civil Aviation Organization and whose jobs are threatened because of the Conservatives' lack of diplomacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334269">In light of our recent past and the government's failed attempts at international diplomacy, I hope that this bill marks a shift towards genuine, respectful multilateral diplomacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334270">Simply passing Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> will not repair the damage this government has done to our international reputation, but it could be a first step towards regaining our place in the world, which is so important to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3334271">I sincerely hope that the Conservatives will seize this chance as an opportunity to do just that, because we have a great deal of expertise in the field of nuclear science. Canada has long been a leader in this field, and an engaged Canada on this file can be a large force for good for the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334272">We need to remember how the world has changed around us in the past 30 years when it comes to nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, the number of nations with these weapons or the capacity to make them was small, with the United States and Russia by far holding the largest arsenals of these weapons. These two superpowers had strong control over their stockpiles, but after the fall of the Iron Curtain, into the 1990s and beyond, we saw that control weaken in Russia. We also saw more countries gain nuclear facilities, either for energy production or for research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334273"> Also, as I mentioned earlier, the world is a much smaller place today and the ability to move people and items around this planet has increased immensely. These conditions make it all the more important to work with other nations and bring ourselves into compliance with conventions like these.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3334274">Between 1993 and 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency identified close to 2,000 incidents related to the use, transportation and unauthorized possession of nuclear and radioactive material. That is a lot, considering the destruction and damage that a single nuclear attack could do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334275">In light of the danger these materials and weapons pose, we need to ensure that we have the necessary laws in place to stop those who could use them during terrorist attacks. We need to work together with the rest of the world to meet this challenge. We need to work with other countries to protect our safety here, at home, in light of the threat that nuclear materials pose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334276">We can protect our own safety, but not by barricading ourselves behind our borders and hoping that the problem will go away on its own. It is time to take action. I encourage my colleagues to join us and support this legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334295">Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I am rising in the House in support of Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> on nuclear terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334296">This bill would amend the Criminal Code in order to add the criminal law requirements found in two international treaties designed to combat nuclear terrorism around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334297">The two treaties in question are the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the CPPNM, and the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334298">These international conventions require the signatory states to improve the physical protection of their nuclear facilities as well as the use, storage and transport of nuclear materials. The states are also required to create new criminal offences for acts of terrorism, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334299">These treaties show that the international community is willing to work together to combat the threats against countries all around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334300">Unfortunately, we are seeing an increasing number of nuclear threats around the world, whether we are talking about Canada, the United States or other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334301">In the past, for example, at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in 2010 and in Seoul in 2012, Canada committed to be legally bound by these conventions and to ratify them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334302">In 2005, Canada signed the two United Nations treaties, but since then, the Conservatives have unfortunately done nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334303">Bill S-9 would pop up on the order paper from time to time, when they were trying to fill some holes to avoid prorogation. Now, as we approach the end of the session and there are still a few weeks to fill, Bill S-9 is back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334304">This is an extremely important issue, but Canada has dragged its feet when it comes to honouring the promises and commitments we made to the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334305">Despite everything, I am happy that we are having this debate in the House and that we can maybe move forward with legislation to better protect Canadians and people in other countries, as well as have better relations with the rest of the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334306">At present, we are still unable to keep our promise to ratify those treaties because we do not have a legislative provision in the Criminal Code that criminalizes the offences contained in the two treaties we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334307">If Bill S-9 were passed, it would allow Canada to finally fulfill its international obligations by amending the Criminal Code, which in turn would then meet the requirements of international conventions that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has clearly said he wants Canada to endorse. It is time to keep that promise and to finally achieve the desired result of ensuring everyone's security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334308">The bill on nuclear terrorism we are debating today includes 10 clauses that would create four new offences under part II of the Criminal Code, as well as other amendments that are consequential to these four offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334309">They have already been described at length in the House. I will not go over all the legislative provisions contained in this bill. However, it is extremely important that we make these amendments to the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334310">The NDP firmly believes in the importance of promoting multilateral diplomacy and international co-operation, especially on such an important issue as nuclear terrorism. This is not the kind of file that we can shove into a drawer and come back to when we have more time or at a more opportune moment. It is something that must be dealt with fairly quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334311">Canada signed these treaties back in 2005. A number of years passed before some measures were taken in order to get the wheels turning. That is what I find disappointing about the whole process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334312">There is something else that I find quite unfortunate. Once again, the Senate was given the responsibility of introducing a bill that is of vital importance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334313">It should not be the role of the unelected chamber. Still, I have to say that I appreciate the technical work that was done here. It was painstaking and detailed work. The senators even managed to correct at least one shortcoming in the bill. That effort is appreciated. However, I still believe that this bill should have been introduced initially in the House of Commons, which is where we should have been debating it from the start. Of course, we have the opportunity to do so now, but it is getting to us a bit late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334314">Despite the procedural shortcomings, Canada still has a responsibility to the international community, and we really need to take action. We have to get serious about domestic and international nuclear security, and we have to co-operate more with other countries on strategies to fight nuclear terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334315">Unfortunately, threats in today's world are increasing in number and diversity. It can be difficult to predict what tragedy may happen if radioactive or nuclear material were to fall into the wrong hands. Small amounts of this material can cause absolutely unbelievable damage. That is why it is so important to pass Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document> and ensure that the steps we are taking here, in Canada, truly meet our needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334316">Aside from creating new offences for nuclear terrorism, threats and so on, what I find interesting and important is that the treaties address various aspects of transporting and storing nuclear material, be it nuclear waste or something else. Canada is a significant producer of medical isotopes. We still use nuclear material that is highly enriched, which creates large quantities of waste that must be disposed of safely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334317">There are ways to deal with that.  I do not think that the materials currently used to make our medical isotopes should still be used. There are alternatives that would produce good results. In the meantime, we need to commit to reducing the quantity of waste we produce from medical isotopes and find better ways to store it. Canada already does this relatively well, but we can always do better and ensure even better protection for the people within our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334318">Some of my colleagues also mentioned the closure of the Gentilly-2 reactor in Quebec, which highlights the importance of proper storage of nuclear materials and proper disposal of waste. Given the closure of that reactor, we need to ensure that we really can dispose of radioactive materials safely when they can no longer be used, in order to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands and do not affect the health of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334319">I am sure everyone remembers what happened with Bruce Power, an Ontario company, in 2011. It wanted to transport 16 nuclear reactors down the St. Lawrence River and then on to Sweden to decontaminate them, bring them back here and then bury them. It stirred up a great deal of controversy at the time. Mayors of the cities and towns along the river opposed it, and the company had to change its plans. In fact, people were worried about the precedent it would set, about the transportation of this kind of waste increasing considerably on the river, thereby potentially putting our health at risk. Once again, we cannot always predict what will happen with this kind of transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334320">These are all issues that we need to address as parliamentarians. We had the opportunity to do so with Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>. It is critically important that we pass this bill and I hope it receives unanimous support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334338"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (fairness for victims)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="8">Bill C-479. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="3334339"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to be standing here to speak to important amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act that I proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>, an act to bring fairness for the victims of violent offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334340">I would first like to thank the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and Senator Boisvenu for their public show of support this week for this legislation. I appreciate their commitment and I am encouraged by their ongoing leadership to help bring about the fairness we are seeking for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334341">Strengthening the voice of victims of violent crimes and the proposed increased time between parole hearings are two aspects of this bill that act on the changes that victims, their families and advocates like the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime have urged for many years. It is time to bring these to fruition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334342">Let us be clear. We are talking about instances of violent crime. I do not think words can ever adequately describe the repulsiveness of these crimes. They are heinous, are often calculated and always senseless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334343">It is an honour for me to be speaking to this bill today. I do so on behalf of my constituents and, tragically, thousands of Canadians like them, as well as the sacred memory of their loved ones. From the time I was elected in 2006, I have had many constituents share their concerns about the imbalance between the victims and the perpetrators in our justice system. However, my dedication to pursue this kind of legislation was galvanized when my constituents asked me to attend a Parole Board hearing with them in 2010. They wanted their federal representative to see first-hand what the process was like and the voice given to the victims, primarily through the victim impact statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334344">When I agreed to attend, I knew it would be an emotional experience. I was hoping it would also be an educational experience. It was for sure. However, I do not think I could ever have begun to prepare myself for the raw emotion in that room that day. As long as I live, I will never forget it. Before even uttering a word, my constituent started to weep. The memories of a crime committed over 30 years previously came flooding back and the tears were endless. It was a grisly triple murder: her sister, niece and nephew had been brutally murdered by her sister's husband. After killing his wife, this violent criminal suffocated his two young children, a six-year-old and a five-year-old. The murderer meticulously concealed the bodies in the waterways of Hamilton, Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334345">My constituent wrote her first victim impact statement on the eve of the funeral. Over the years, she and her family insisted on attending the Parole Board hearings to ensure the voice of victims was heard. They felt an incredible burden, a duty as a family. It was the least they could do to honour the victims: their sister, their daughter, their grandchildren, their niece, their nephew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334346">What struck me like a ton of bricks was the re-victimization of having to deliver the statement over and over, year after year. It was so cruel, so frustrating and so unnecessary. I watched the family endure the same process again in 2011. Again, the triple murderer was denied parole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334347">This experience inspired Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>. I set about talking to victims, advocates, law enforcement officials, lawyers and others to ask what could be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334348">Beyond the whole issue of re-victimization, I discovered that provisions in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act that may have made sense in the 1970s no longer reflected modern technology and the respect and dignity our system ought to afford victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334349">From the work my office and I have done in preparation for the introduction of this bill, and the experts we have consulted, this bill has a sound legal and constitutional foundation. I believe it will have broad support as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334350">In tabling Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> in February, I proposed nine changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. They include: extend mandatory review periods for parole whereby if a violent offender is denied parole, the Parole Board of Canada would have to review the case within five years, rather than the current two years; increase the period to within five years in which the Parole Board of Canada must review parole following the cancellation or termination of parole; emphasize that the Parole Board of Canada must take into consideration the victims and the needs of the victim's family to attend hearings and witness the proceedings; and, require that the Parole Board of Canada consider any victim impact statement presented by victims.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334351">One would think that this is already the case, that it is a bit of a no-brainer. However, the bill is necessary to enshrine in law the victim's voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334352">Other straightforward changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> to protect and support victims include requiring the Parole Board of Canada to provide the victim, if requested, with information about the offender's release on parole, statutory release or temporary absence, and to provide victims with information about their offender's correctional plan, including progress toward meeting its objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334353">This is one of the things that Constable Michael Sweet's family, after 30 years of silence, requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334354"> I would like to remind members of Michael Sweet's story so that they can understand the family's depth of feeling with regard to these changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334355">In the early morning hours of March 14, 1980, brothers Craig and Jamie Munro entered what was then George's Bourbon St. Bistro in downtown Toronto for the purpose of committing a robbery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334356">Both men were high on drugs and armed with guns. At the time, Craig Munro was on mandatory supervision from a penitentiary sentence for a previous gun-related offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334357"> The brothers gathered all of the people inside into one place. However, one of the victims managed to successfully flee. Once out on the street, he flagged down a passing police cruiser. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334358">Constable Sweet—who, by the way, is no relation to me—who was 30 at the time, entered the restaurant and was immediately shot twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334359">Then began a 90-minute standoff between the Munro brothers, with their hostages, and police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334360">The police later stormed the restaurant, and both brothers were shot and captured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334361">During the standoff, Sweet was conscious and slowly bleeding to death. He begged his captors to let him go to the hospital. He had three young daughters and he wanted to be with them at home. While Sweet pleaded for his life, they laughed and taunted him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334362">All three men were transported to the hospital after the police broke in. Craig and Jamie made full recoveries; Sweet died a few hours later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334363">I should note that many of the changes I am proposing in Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> have been enacted by our Commonwealth colleagues, such as Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334364">I believe one of the fundamental responsibilities of the state is to keep our citizens safe. Violent offenders have committed unspeakable crimes. Families have suffered losses that are forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334365">I hope these changes will help bring a measure of comfort to my constituents and thousands of other Canadian families who have been victimized in this way, people who have had their loved ones taken during the prime of their lives and who have lived with that pain day after day. The last thing they need is another gut-wrenching re-victimization through a parole system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334366">In closing, please allow me to read a few public comments from people impacted directly by violent crime.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334378">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170125" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation> for introducing Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>. This bill seems to address many of the recommendations made by the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334379">The hon. member touched on the analysis he had done of his bill before introducing it. When it comes to private members' bills, more so than with government bills, I am always a bit concerned when they are introduced that they may not be consistent with the charter. Mind you, we should also be concerned about the bills introduced by the government, considering its approach to things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334380">I would like the hon. member to elaborate on the type of research he conducted or the analyses he had done of his bill, specifically with regard to the provision on the cancellation of a parole review hearing if an offender has repeatedly refused to attend previous hearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334381">Did he really determine whether this was consistent with the charter, to see if there is a problem on that level? Is the hon. member reasonably sure about that?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3334382">Mr. Speaker, all of us here in Parliament have access to the lawyers who are drafting these bills. I actually tabled a bill in the last Parliament that died on the order paper. We spent the last couple of years making sure that these bills were constitutionally sound, were legally sound and were reasonable, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334383"> I believe that the member is talking about the vexatious habit of scheduling them and then cancelling them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334384"> Again, I want to make sure members know that this just gives the Parole Board of Canada discretion. I think there are very good people on the Parole Board of Canada, and they need the tools to have that discretion. Whether it is the case the member asked about or a case of it being within five years, it does not mean that a review will not happen before then. It just means that they have up to five years to schedule such a review. It gives them the discretion. Many of them have great experience, which I have witnessed myself at a Parole Board hearing, and are able to determine what the best course of action is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334385">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for introducing this bill and for being the kind of member of Parliament who stands up for his constituents and does not just talk about it. He really has put action to his words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334386">I want to follow up on my colleague's question on the issue of offenders cancelling their hearings. Could my colleague address how his bill would deal with that and what the problem has been? I think many Canadians do not know that offenders can cancel their parole hearings on very short notice and that it can have a horrible effect on victims. I wonder if my hon. colleague can explain that situation and why his bill is going to address that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3334387">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. I half spoke to the answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334388">When a victim is going to go to one of these Parole Board hearings, it is months of getting the emotional fortitude it is going to take to go there. People review their victim impact statements, often with the entire family that was affected. As they get ready to do this, sometimes it is communicated to them that the whole thing has been cancelled, which is another huge emotional trauma for them, only to be scheduled at a later date and cancelled again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334389">It is painful enough for the victims to have to endure this process. They do this because they have a duty to the victim who was either killed or dealt with violently in some other way. They should not be re-victimized because someone wants to use the system in a way it was never intended to be used. The system is really a rehabilitative process for the convict and for ensuring the security of Canadian citizens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334390">Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170125" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation> for introducing Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>, which the NDP will support at second reading. I must admit that we will support it without much reservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334391">Not only does the bill talk about helping victims, but, in practical terms, it will achieve the desired effect. Sometimes in the House, we hear grand speeches, great oratorical rhetoric from the government benches. It gives the public the impression that the government is doing something, when in fact it is not. It does a little bit here and there, but does not necessarily achieve what we are looking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334392">That cannot be said about this bill. Of course, we have to take a good look at it, because I rarely write a blank cheque, especially not when it comes to the Conservative government's bills. I would like for us to study the bills in committee, go over them in greater detail, and ensure that we come back to the House at third reading with bills that make sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334393">We think it is safe to say that the bill is legal and consistent with the charter and the Constitution. Regardless of the political side of the matter, it achieves the desired effect and even if it does not achieve the desired political effect, it makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334394">The bill finally truly addresses the issue of victims. Anyone who has practised law and who has been inside Canada's courthouses from coast to coast has noticed some very specific things, above and beyond the money that the justice system costs and the financial burden that many victims face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334395">According to the government, Bill <Document DbId="5507161" Type="3">C-37</Document>, with regard to the surcharge, will solve almost all of victims' financial problems. However, when we dig a little deeper, we realize that, once again, this is only a drop in the bucket when it comes to what victims need. What do victims tell us on a regular basis? What does the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime tell us? What recommendations did she make at the time?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334396">In her 2010 report, among others, she recommended that the federal government shift the burden of responsibility to provide information to victims under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act from victims to the Correctional Service of Canada and the National Parole Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334397">The member opposite's bill addresses part of that recommendation. It responds to the recommendation to give victims the right to attend National Parole Board hearings through the use of available technologies such as video conferencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334398">It also responds to the recommendation to take into account the needs of victims when it comes to the timing, frequency and scheduling of parole hearings. However, these are not the only things that the ombudsman asked the federal government to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334399">The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is on a tour of Canada to try to talk to victims. I thought that he had done this quite awhile ago and that he had a good idea of victims' needs. I can give him some suggestions that could be included in a possible charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334400">Clearly, this type of bill could set out fundamental principles that show the respect that Canadians and the Government of Canada have for victims' needs, including during court cases and trials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334401">The problems are not limited to parole. They are sometimes related to the trials themselves, which can often seem to go on forever. We can implement all the measures we like under Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> or any other bill, but if we do not resolve the problems related to accessing justice and awaiting trial, then victims will remain victims for a long time yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334402">Not only are they victimized during sentencing and at parole hearings, for instance, but they are also victimized in the very process of reaching a verdict. This is a fundamental problem.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334403">Often they are not even fully aware of what is going on. Sentences are negotiated between Crown attorneys and defence lawyers. Victims—who may have been summoned three, four, five or even 10 times during some exceptionally long trials—could find themselves back at square one. On top of that, they are told they have to appear before the parole board, which also takes time, and they are asked to stand in front of the person who victimized them. Thus, they are victimized all over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334404">With government bills, whether they come from the back benches, the government itself or the Senate, a piecemeal approach is often taken, when a comprehensive approach is required. It always breaks my heart a little, because I have so much respect for our justice system. I also have a very hard time seeing how the public perceives its judicial system. Yes, it definitely has some flaws, but we are trying to correct them. Basically, every time we correct just one little thing, we open up a new Pandora's box and create imbalances. That is the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334405">In the context of Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask my colleague to clarify these changes, like the one to revisit parole reviews for offenders serving a sentence of less than two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334406">We need to keep in mind that these are vile offences, as he said. When it comes to violent offences, some victims and their families may prefer not to attend parole hearings. Some victims, for example rape victims, should not be called to appear at all, not even through videoconference. Some of them need to completely close themselves off from that part of their lives. We need to be very respectful of that, while giving those who want to speak the opportunity to do so, since that is what some people need. They want to face their aggressor. For them, it is a way to get over the events of their past. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334407">There is so much we can do to support victims if we really want to and if we go beyond talking. I believe that words revictimize these people, because words seem to promise solutions to their problems. In the end, however, five or 10 years later, they will realize that nothing has changed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334408">As for the surcharges suggested in the bill, they are peanuts. They will only add a few tens of millions of dollars to our coffers. Let us look at the numbers. I did not come up with them; Senator Boisvenu did. He enjoys showing up everywhere to remind us of these numbers, and rightly so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334409">In 2003 alone, crime cost $70 billion. Victims assumed 70% of the cost of crime, or $47 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334410">Professor Irvin Waller appeared before the committee when we were studying Bill <Document DbId="5507161" Type="3">C-37</Document>, which the government bragged about at length as the solution, the way to do the right thing for victims. The government set aside about $16 million in the budget for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334411">Professor Waller said that it did not mean much. The government should work with the provinces and fund a study on the remaining gaps between services and needs. All these things have been recommended. All the government has to do is decide to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334412">I think victims deserve a little more respect from their government. The government should move from words to action. It should do more than just pretend and hold press conferences for the fun of it. We need to try to find lasting solutions that get to the heart of the issue of justice system accessibility, first and foremost. We need to ensure that trials take place much more quickly than they are now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334413">Some provinces, including Alberta, think the answer is more judges. Let us make that happen. We need to, if we believe in a system of justice, law and order that works and that respects victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334414">I thank my colleague opposite for his bill. The NDP will study it carefully in committee, and we will be proud to support it at second reading.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3334415">Mr. Speaker, as a rule we must analyze legislation such as Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> through the prism of the important overriding objective of ensuring the long-term public safety of Canadian society, and that means being smart about crime. We must also measure such legislation against the criterion of whether it harms or helps victims or, if neutral, whether more could be done to support victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334416">It is worth mentioning, and it has been mentioned before in the debate today, that private members' bills do not obtain charter scrutiny as do bills that originate in the Department of Justice; although doubts have recently been planted that even government bills may not be benefiting from rigorous vetting through the prism of adherence to charter principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334417">Liberals support sending Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> to committee precisely to better understand how it meets the above criteria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334418">Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> would make changes to specific aspects of the conditional release system in Canada. However, first it might be wise to briefly enumerate the kinds of conditional release available in this country. They are escorted and unescorted temporary absences, day parole, full parole and statutory release with supervision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334419">The bill deals more specifically with full parole for violent offenders, namely, for crimes cited under schedule 1 of the Criminal Code. In Canada, once an offender has served one-third of his or her sentence or seven years, whichever is less, he or she becomes eligible to apply for parole. Generally the offender's parole request is considered at a parole hearing before the Parole Board of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334420">The bill, as I understand it, would not change the modalities and rules governing the initial parole request but rather the consequences that flow from being denied parole, which itself is seen as an indicator that the offender has not made progress toward rehabilitation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334421">Currently, as I understand the system, an offender, even after being denied parole, can reapply for parole on an annual basis. However, the Parole Board is not obliged upon review of the case to grant the hearing for as long as two years after the initial parole refusal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334422">The goal of the bill is to spare victims and their families the nightmare of attending repeated parole hearings. It is no secret that there are offenders who definitely are not on the road to rehabilitation but who wish to trigger repeated parole hearings for no other reason than to torment victims. I believe it is at these types of offenders that the bill is aimed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334423">Offenders serving time for schedule 1 offences, the most serious and often violent offences, whose parole is refused because they are not progressing under their rehabilitation plan would no longer automatically be eligible for a hearing two years after their initial parole refusal, as at present; rather, under the bill, the Parole Board of Canada would be permitted to deny a hearing for as long as five years after the offender was initially denied parole, even if he or she applied annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334424">The bill attempts to clarify and reinforce victims' rights in other ways. I understand the member has developed the bill as a result of attending a parole hearing for an offender who was serving a sentence for multiple murders. This must have been a life-changing experience for the member, and there are no doubt elements of the bill rooted in the wisdom gained from that experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334425">Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> would codify a number of existing practices that assist victims in various ways. Bill C-479 adds a declaration that every effort must be made to allow victims or victims' families to attend parole hearings. Currently the Corrections and Conditional Release Act does not contain a provision dealing with attendance by victims; they have to apply. However, I should mention that they are rarely, if ever, refused attendance at a hearing, as far as I understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334426">Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> would also allow victims or their families to view a hearing via a one-way closed circuit connection, should they not be permitted to attend or they would prefer viewing from a distance where they would not need to be in the same room as the offender. Currently in a parole hearing victims may present a statement describing the harm done to them or loss suffered by them as a result of the offence, although this is not a right in law, as I understand it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334427">If they are not in attendance, the statement may be presented by way of audiotape or videotape, accompanied by a written copy of the statement. The bill seeks to entrench the consideration of victim impact statements in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. The bill would also allow the victim impact statement to be submitted in writing only, rather than the current prescribed formats of videotape or audiotape accompanied by a written statement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334428">The bill would also give victims the legislated right to access certain information about the offender. As I understand it, victims would be able to register to receive information automatically. Certain on-request information would be automatically provided if the bill is passed, such as the conditions attached to the conditional release. Also, the information that victims could request would include information relating to the offender's treatment plan and progress toward the plan's objective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334429">Finally, it would be mandatory for the victim or family to be notified at least 14 days in advance of their offender receiving any form of conditional release, as well as being informed of the offender's destination upon release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334430">This bill appears to have many positive aspects, and I look forward, as do my other colleagues no doubt, to examining the bill in committee and also to examining the way the parole system works. It is very complicated, complex and technical. This would be an opportunity to better understand that system and to understand how it could be made fairer for victims. It looks like this bill would go a long way toward that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3334431">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity today to rise and speak in support of private member's Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>, which was brought forward by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170125" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334432"> I want to thank and commend my colleague for his strong commitment to placing the needs, rights and interests of victims ahead of criminals and for introducing this bill that would further strengthen victims' rights in this country. The bill includes measures that are in keeping with our government's strong commitment to support victims of crime and ensure that they have a strong voice in the justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334433">While we have made some very good progress over the past seven years to meet these commitments, we know that more work needs to be done. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="105826" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> recently outlined the next phase of the Government of Canada's plan for safe streets and communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334434">Through this plan, our government will take further action in the following areas:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334435"> We will tackle crime by holding offenders accountable for their actions. This includes bringing forward legislation to further toughen penalties for child sexual offences and to better understand the risks posed by known child sex offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334436">As well, we have introduced Bill <Document DbId="5964767" Type="3">C-54, not criminally responsible reform act</Document>, which would better protect the public from accused persons who have been found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder. Such legislation would ensure that public safety is the paramount consideration in these cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334437">We also moved ahead with further measures to enhance the rights of victims by introducing legislation to implement a victims' bill of rights. This legislation would serve to further enhance the government's commitment to victims of crime by entrenching their rights into law at the federal level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334438"> I want to again thank my colleague, because he mentioned this important piece. It is one thing to talk about victims' rights, but they need to be enshrined in federal law. My colleague's bill will move forward on this as will what our government is doing to support victims of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334439">Finally, we will increase the efficiency of our justice system by looking at measures to make our justice system more efficient through the “Economics of Policing” study. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334440">Members may recall that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170125" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation> introduced a similar bill in 2011. He has been very committed to this cause and continues to be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334441">Since 2011, we have passed into law the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which included these important measures to enhance the participation of victims in the justice system and to increase offender accountability. As such, Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> proposes some important changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, also known as the CCRA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334442">I will now look at how Bill C-479 would amend the CCRA. First, private member's Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> proposes to extend mandatory review periods for parole. For example, if a violent offender is denied parole, the Parole Board of Canada would then be obligated to review the case within five years rather than the current two years. Again, we have heard today the impact that would have on victims. Rather than having to come back every two years and relive the horror and tragedy of what they or their families went through, the bill would extend that period to five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334443">The bill also proposes to hold detention reviews every two years rather than annually. Again, this considers the rights and interests of victims and what they go through when they are unfortunately re-victimized every time they have to go through this. This would not only affect offenders who are not ready to be released into the community at their statutory release date, at two-thirds of the sentence, but would also put victims' interests into the equation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334444">The second set of changes to the CCRA proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> relates to the attendance of victims and members of their families at parole review hearings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334445">There is no magic formula for healing from the traumatic experience of violent crime. There is no single set of counselling, time or things that can happen after one is victimized. There is no magic formula that can fix the pain and tragedy victims have gone through. Each victim, each family member, is affected differently and will cope in a unique way. With this in mind, Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> proposes to give more weight to the needs of victims in the justice system. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334446">Specifically, Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> proposes that if victims are denied the opportunity to observe the hearings in person, they could follow the hearings by teleconference or one-way closed-circuit feed, again another way that the government and the Parole Board could show victims that their voices matter. Currently, there can be distance and time and it can be very difficult for victims to attend hearings, yet they want to see it or be a part of it. This bill would give them the opportunity to follow hearings by teleconference or one-way closed-circuit feed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334447">The bill would provide useful tools. However, we need to strike a balance between theory and practice. Therefore, there are some minor amendments to make it easier to implement this and we expect amendments would be required for this part of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334448">Currently, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act gives victims the right to certain basic information about offenders and criminals. At the same time, it gives the Parole Board of Canada and Correctional Service Canada discretion to provide additional information if the interests of the victims clearly outweigh the privacy concerns for the offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334449">Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> proposes to expand the rights of victims ahead of the rights of criminals in order for information to be shared about offenders. Specifically, it would make the release of certain information mandatory rather than discretionary. This information would include the date, if any, when an offender would be released on either unescorted or escorted temporary absences. As well, a victim would be informed of any of the conditions attached to an offender's unescorted temporary absence, parole or statutory release and the reasons for any unescorted temporary absences. In addition, a victim would be informed of the destination of an offender when released on unescorted temporary absence or parole or statutory release. Again, one would assume this has already taken place, but it has not, and those are some of the provisions that the bill would provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334450">Obviously, it is important for victims to have all this information well in advance of an offender's temporary release. Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> proposes that the chairperson of the Parole Board of Canada discloses this information at least 14 days before an offender is released. The bill would further provide victims with information about offenders' correctional plans, including progress toward meeting their objectives and providing transcripts of parole hearings, if they are produced. Should the bill be referred to committee, we would again seek to move certain amendments to ensure that any necessary public safety safeguards would be in place for the sharing of this information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334451">Again, I would like to commend my colleague for his strong commitment to victims and for introducing this bill to further strengthen the rights of victims. The changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> bring greater fairness to the justice system for victims. This is in keeping with our government's commitments and I am proud to indicate that we will be supporting this important legislation.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334458">The ombudsman found that the Corrections and Conditional Release Act must reflect the same principles. It remains to be seen, during our study in committee, whether Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> makes this law consistent with these principles in an effective and balanced manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334459">The Corrections and Conditional Release Act was enacted in 1992. It was the first federal statute governing corrections and conditional release that officially recognized the victims. Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> seems to respond to two things the ombudsman considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334460">I would like to address the first aspect of the question. In her report, the ombudsman pointed out that victims do not automatically receive information on offenders during the release process. In order to access that information, victims have to figure out for themselves how to get the information and how to register with the National Parole Board. Just imagine how very difficult it must be for a victim who has been severely traumatized to navigate through this red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334461">The ombudsman indicated that the registered victim-to-offender ratio is still quite low. There are over 20,000 offenders currently in federal custody, approximately 70% of which are serving sentences for violent crimes. Yet just over 6,000 victims are registered to receive information on fewer than 4,000 offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334462">It is impossible to determine whether the victims who are not registered chose not to be or whether they were simply unaware of their rights. Representatives from the parole system and the ombudsman think one of the primary obstacles of getting victims to sign up is that there is a lack of information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334463">The National Parole Board should take the initiative to give them this information and should automatically communicate with victims to inform them of their right to receive information. The proposed amendment in Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> would make it mandatory to provide transcripts of a parole review hearing to victims and members of their family and the offenders, and to provide victims with the information under consideration by the board during the offender's review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334464">I would like to talk about the second important aspect. In her report, the ombudsman pointed out that we must take the concerns of victims into account during decisions pertaining to the release and supervision of an offender.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334465">Many victims have expressed concerns about an offender being released on parole when they live in the area. In some cases, this fear prevents victims from asking for information because they fear reprisals should the offender become aware that the victim is interested in the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334466">Furthermore, according to the ombudsman, victims want to know that the information they provide will be considered. In light of that, Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> is designed to make it easier for victims or their family members to attend parole review hearings and for their statements to be taken into consideration in decisions regarding the offender's release. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334467">The amendment to the act would also ensure that victims are informed if an offender is to be released on temporary absence, parole or statutory release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334468">Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> would also allow for the cancellation of a parole review hearing if an offender has repeatedly refused to attend, or waived his or her right to attend, previous hearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334469">We are sensitive to victims' concerns. We will examine Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> carefully to ensure that it addresses the demands made by the ombudsman for victims of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334470">However, we have some concerns. First, we want to ensure that the bill does not in any way violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334471">Can my colleague opposite confirm that he has done his homework and that he has verified that Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> complies with the charter and the Constitution?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334472">Second, Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> should have been a government bill. I wonder why the Conservatives are using a private member's bill to push the government's agenda, which has always been focused on victims' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334473">Why did the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> not introduce Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> himself? Why did the member for <Affiliation DbId="170125" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation> take up this cause?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334474">Third, private members' bills must assess and cost the changes they propose. They must assess the impact on the provinces and territories, especially with respect to parole boards. They must also provide proper compensation, if required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334475">Did my colleague opposite consult the provinces when drafting this bill? Can he tell what the bill will cost? Which level of government will pay these additional costs?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334476">In closing, if our concerns are addressed in committee, and if there is clear proof that the bill respects the victim and judicial independence, I will be pleased to throw my full support behind this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334477">For that reason, we support the bill at second reading and its referral to committee for more in-depth study.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3334478">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to continue the debate on Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document>, an act to bring fairness for the victims of violent offenders, a bill which I support, with amendments proposed by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334479">Let me begin by commending the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170125" Type="2">Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale</Affiliation> for his tenacity in fighting for the rights of victims. The predecessor to this bill was introduced into the House of Commons during the previous Parliament and was debated for an hour prior to dissolution, yet the hon. member has held fast to his vision and deserves our admiration and respect for his hard work in bringing the bill forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334480">Today's debate is an opportunity to reflect on the traumatic impact of violent crime on its victims and what our government is doing to support our victims and what more we can do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334481">I will not pretend to fully understand the harm that violent crime inflicts on a victim. Only those who have survived such a terrible experience have the right to speak of it. However, I have met with victims of crime and I have seen the toll of emotional trauma and the desire for meaningful participation in the justice system. They spoke because they needed to be heard. Giving voice to their experience empowers them because they are determined to gain control over their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334482">Our government is listening. Our government is committed to keeping our streets and communities safe and supporting victims, which includes strengthening legislation, protecting victims rights, tackling crime and ensuring fair and efficient justice. All of these will have a positive impact on the victims of crime and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334483">When our government was elected in 2006, we pledged to Canadians that we would work hard to address the needs of victims of crime and their families. I am proud to say that we have made significant progress. The National Office for Victims, Public Safety Canada is helping victims gain a greater voice in the corrections and conditional release process. It is helping victims get access to the information and services they might need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334484">Apart from the physical and emotional trauma of violent crime, victims may also carry a financial burden. Worries about money adds stress to families at the worst possible time. That is why, last November, our government announced a new income support program to ease the financial burden on parents who were struggling to cope with the death or disappearance of a child. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334485">Even as we are helping victims of crime, we are working hard to prevent these crimes from happening in the first place. In our high speed culture it has never been easier for young people to go astray. If we can address the risk factors early, we may well prevent young people from falling in with the wrong crowd. One of the strategy's programs, for example, is the youth gang prevention fund. On the one hand, the fund helps communities develop programs to help youth at risk to make better choices and avoid criminal behaviour. On the other hand, it works with families that have been victimized. I am proud to note that in 2011 alone, our government funded 138 community-based crime prevention programs through this strategy. All told, these programs reached 16,000 youth at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334486">I have highlighted our government's support for victims of violent crime and our efforts to reduce the chance of violent crime occurring in the first place. We are also helping victims at the legislative level. Over the past seven years, our government has introduced and passed compelling and comprehensive changes to our legislation, changes that support crime prevention, that give police the tools they need to fight crime and increase offender accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334487">The centrepiece of our approach is the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which received royal assent last March. As part of the significant overhaul of our justice system, the act provided greater support for victims of crime. Victims are entitled to be kept better informed about the behaviour and management of offenders. An act of violence can touch many people. That is why the Safe Streets and Communities Act expanded the definition of a registered victim. This definition now includes the guardians and caregivers of dependents of victims who are deceased, ill or otherwise incapacitated. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3334488">Our government has tilted the justice system back to where it should be. Through our steady approach, we are strengthening legislation, protecting the rights of victims, tackling crime and ensuring justice is fair and efficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334489"> Private member's Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> would complement our drive toward making the justice system work better for victims of offenders. It proposes changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act that would complement the Safe Streets and Communities Act by: modifying parole and detention of review dates; facilitate victims observing hearings; and expanding the rights of victims to have access to information about the offender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334490">As we have heard, our government will seek to move minor amendments should the bill be referred to a committee for study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334491"> I believe private member's Bill <Document DbId="5997679" Type="4">C-479</Document> is important legislation that would support the rights of victims. I urge all hon. members to join me in supporting the bill before us today.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3334492">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to use these four minutes to speak to this bill we will be supporting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334493">I am always interested in speaking on issues related to public safety and victims' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334494">Today we are debating an important bill that seems to follow up on recommendations from the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime, which tabled a report in 2010 in an effort to move towards greater respect for victims in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334495">The recommendations contained in that report seem to be reflected in this bill. One recommendation was to shift the burden of responsibility to provide information to victims under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act from victims to the Correctional Service of Canada and the National Parole Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334496">Another recommendation was to give victims the right to attend National Parole Board hearings through the use of available technologies such as video conferencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334497">In addition, it was recommended that victims be given a stronger voice in the timing, frequency and scheduling of parole hearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334498">We support the initiatives set out in this bill, which promote fairness for victims. We will study the bill in detail to ensure that it addresses as many of their needs as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334499">I find it curious that this government often uses backbenchers to introduce these types of bills, instead of having the department do it, which is how it should be done. During this Parliament, we have noticed that a large number of public safety and justice bills have been introduced by backbenchers, which is not customary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334500">In 2007, the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime organized a round table where participants identified the fact that the Corrections and Conditional Release Act did not contain any provisions on how victims of crime should be treated. This law dictates how offenders should be treated, but it does not include any provisions about how victims should be treated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334501">One participant remarked that the Corrections and Conditional Release Act embodies the principles that govern the treatment of offenders—that is, decisions concerning offenders must be clear and fair—but there is no law that sets out principles for the treatment of victims. The participants suggested that the same principles should apply to victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334502">The observations of the round table participants corresponded to the findings of the National Consultation with Victims of Crime conducted by the Solicitor General of Canada in 2001. The Corrections and Conditional Release Act only mentions the release of information to victims and communications with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334503">In her report, the ombudsman for victims of crime indicated that, in order to ensure that victims have legitimate rights within correctional and conditional release systems, the laws must clearly indicate how they are to be treated, and these laws must be applied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334504">That is what the hon. member wanted to do by introducing this bill, and I thank him for this initiative, which I still think should have gone through the Department of Public Safety. Still, it is an important step toward defending victims' rights, and we thank him for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3334505">I will support his bill at second reading.</ParaText>
