              <ParaText id="2478793"> She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to reintroduce this bill. This bill deals with a very important issue which was brought to my attention by a constituent, Thea Beil, who tragically died from a very rare form of cancer. In the process of tying up her affairs, she realized that after all the years she paid into the Canada pension plan she would not be allowed to designate a beneficiary because she had no surviving spouse or common law partner. She felt this was a very discriminatory element of the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478794"> I have brought this issue forward to the House. I have written to the minister to point out this discriminatory aspect of the Canada pension plan. Ms. Beil, who has now unfortunately passed away, paid into the Canada pension plan for over 25 years and had no opportunity to designate a beneficiary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478795">In this day and age, this kind of discrimination should not be allowed to exist. I know that provincial plans, for example, the B.C. superannuation plan, have provisions whereby a person can designate a beneficiary if the person has no spouse or partner. There should be the same sort of fairness at the federal level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478796">I introduce this bill in the name of Thea Beil who, before she tragically died, worked and contributed much to this country but was not able to designate a beneficiary for her Canada pension plan benefits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478797">I hope members of the House will support this bill to end this discrimination.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478799">She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce this bill. This bill would amend the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act and the Textile Labelling Act (animal fur or skin). I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> for seconding the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478800">This bill was originally introduced by my colleague, Bill Siksay, the former member for Burnaby—Douglas. He did much work on this issue. I am delighted to introduce the bill and follow up on the work that he has been doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478801">The bill would prohibit the import and sale of products made in whole or in part of dog or cat fur. It would also require all animal skins to be labelled with full disclosure of fur fibres on labels. Many Canadians are very concerned about the use of cat and dog fur and strongly support a ban on its use in imports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478802">If we pass this bill, we would be joining Australia, Switzerland, the United States and the European Union in banning products that contain dog and cat skins and furs. As well, the labelling requirements would change. Under the current act, products can simply be labelled fur “fibre” no matter what quantity is involved. This bill would amend that to make sure there is explicit and clear labelling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478803">In presenting this bill, I want to note the incredible work of the Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals. I know there are many Canadians who support this legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478807">Suicide is an issue that touches every region of this country. The facts are clear. Over 3,500 Canadians, or 10 people per day, die by suicide each year. We need a coordinated strategy so that folks around the country working to prevent suicide are united in a concerted effort to ensure that our communities are no longer rocked by the loss of friends and family members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478808">I would like to congratulate the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention on its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478809">A national strategy is needed to address the higher risks of suicide faced by queer youth, Canada's elderly, teens and young adults, first nations, Inuit, and people in remote communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478825">In Canada far too many lives are lost each year to suicide, almost 4,000, over 10 each day. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Canadian youth ages 10 to 24. Aboriginal youth suicide rates are especially troubling at five to seven times higher than the non-aboriginal rate. In Waterloo region's high schools, three youths lost their lives to suicide in just one single week last year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478831">I would also point out that the adoption of the bill actually would fulfill the campaign promise of the Conservative Party which, in its campaign literature in 2006, promised to introduce John Reid's open government act. It found its way into the federal accountability legislation in 2006 but was promptly removed by the time that bill received first reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478832">The bill would seek to enhance and expand the access to information regime in this country. It would create a public interest override. The public interest would override the interests of the government in keeping something secret. It would seek to enhance the ability of members of the general public to know what their government was doing with their money, which I argue is a fundamental freedom and a cornerstone of any western democracy. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478864">Over the past few months, the Conservatives have continued to boast about Canada's economic recovery, even in the face of economic turmoil abroad and stagnating growth here at home.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478865">Canadians know that the government's assurances do not reflect reality. We have lost far too many good quality jobs that made it possible for families to make ends meet. Canadian families' budgets are becoming tighter and tighter because of debt. Furthermore, international economic stability and the very slow economic growth are threatening to plunge us into a new recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478866">The primary economic problem facing Canadians right now is not government debt, but slow recovery and the weak job market. The Conservatives' plan to cut spending will make the situation worse instead of better.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478867">We, in the official opposition, know that now is the time to make strategic investments to promote economic growth and attack the real deficit: the jobs deficit. Canadians are tired of talk. What we need now is action. The Conservative government must reconsider its failed approach of something for nothing corporate tax and spending cuts and, instead, put in place a jobs plan, a plan that gets Canadians back to work.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478868">The job market is currently more fragile than it was before the October 2008 crisis. The unemployment rate has risen to 7.3%, while the number of part-time workers and the number of workers looking for full-time employment has increased very rapidly. Quality, full-time jobs that allow families to make a living are very hard to find in every region of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478869">The actual unemployment rate, which includes discouraged workers who have left the labour force and part-time workers who would like to be working full-time, was 11.1% in July 2011, a very significant increase over the July 2008 rate of 9.4%.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478870">In fact, despite the government's repeated boasting about its jobs record, close to 1.4 million Canadians remain unemployed. When people lose jobs, it is a tragedy for those individuals. When we include those who have become discouraged by weak job prospects or who are underemployed, that number rises to close to two million, two million individual tragedies. That is two million Canadians for whom the government's boasting is just a slap in the face.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478871">The lack of progress in getting Canadians back to work is disappointing to say the least. If today the same proportion of Canadians were working as before the 2008 economic crisis, 420,000 more Canadians would have jobs.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478872">The IMF recently predicted that Canada's unemployment rate will rise this year and that in 2012 our economy will grow far more slowly than anticipated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478873">To make matters worse, only 39.6% of the officially unemployed qualify for unemployment insurance, even if they had paid into the program themselves, which means that only two out of five Canadians are actually qualifying for the benefits that they have paid for, and only 26.8% of the real unemployed are covered by EI benefits. Canadians are facing both rising unemployment and decreasing EI coverage, adding insult to injury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478874">At the same time, household debt has hit record levels of 150%, leaving families struggling to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478875">The government's lack of leadership on job creation has real economic costs. Our lower unemployment rate today represents lost wages alone of more than $20 billion, not to mention the billions of dollars in economic stimulus and tax revenues that go along with them.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478876">What is the result? Our economic growth has become stagnant. Economists in all areas have lowered their forecasts with regard to Canada's economic growth. The Conservatives' budget is thus based on growth projections that are no longer realistic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478877">The BMO deputy chief economist has noted that even if Canada and the U.S. avoid another recession, Ottawa will fall far short of the estimates for growth in the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s last budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478878">The Conservatives claim that the solution to all of this is simply more of the same failed policy of no strings attached tax cuts for the same wealthy corporations. However, with the money they have received in tax breaks, large corporations have invested outside of Canada, have paid themselves, their executives, exorbitant bonuses, and have moved good-paying, quality Canadian jobs overseas. Canadian corporations today are sitting on $500 billion, $120 billion of which is through corporate tax cuts, at a time when the economy is in dire need of investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478879">Instead of excusing itself because we are doing better than sicker economies in the G8, the government must put in place policies that encourage private sector investment in our economy here at home. If we want others to express confidence in the economy, we must take the lead by investing in the economy, not by cutting billions of dollars in public spending. Economists agree that it is the wrong time to take money out of the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478880">Doug Porter of BMO told the finance committee this week that recent drops in government bond yield rates are a sign that financial markets are stressed about economic growth prospects, not government deficits or inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478881">The Conference Board of Canada has also emphasized that this is not the time to put the brakes on government spending and government investment. Instead, the government must be willing to step back and consider its approach in response to economic reality.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478882">The Canadian economy is facing serious economic risks as a result of our dependence on American and European markets. The American economy remains extremely weak as a result of the flat housing market, high debt levels and the change from a program involving weak recovery measures to one involving budget cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478883">Fear of a double-dip recession has caused a sharp drop in the stock market over the past few months. The OECD and the IMF are predicting a very slow recovery for developed economies, which will have a major impact on Canadian exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478884">TD Economics has indicated that, while the United States should be able to avoid a recession in 2011, any unpredicted drop in the markets could plunge Canada into another recession. Scotiabank economists have stated that we are facing a very real possibility that the Canadian economy could be the first to fall into a recession. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478890">Pardon me, Madam Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478891">If we look back at what this government did in 2008, it seems to have a habit of letting things deteriorate before taking action. We need measures, we need a job creation plan, and we need these things now.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478892">Today the opposition calls upon the government to take immediate action to: promote job creation; ensure that all Canadians can rely on a stable retirement future; undertake strategic investments to fix the crumbling infrastructure essential to our economy and the security of Canadians; and maintain the full public sector contribution to the Canadian economy in order to increase Canada's competitiveness and divert another recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478893">The total Canadian net government debt is 33.7% of GDP compared to an OECD average of 62.6%. That is about half. Interest rates are at historic lows and money costs much less. This provides an opportunity to make strategic investments in jobs and infrastructure, which are sorely needed. The Toronto Board of Trade emphasizes that a strong infrastructure foundation is a top priority in ensuring economic competitiveness now and into the future. In fact, the OECD has concluded that Toronto's lack of transportation infrastructure is a leading drag on the region's global competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478894">We are not just talking about spending but also about investing. There is a difference. We need to express confidence in Canada's economy and attract private sector investment by investing in targeted incentives for the real job creators. With respect to critical public infrastructure and initiatives, we need to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, and broadband Internet, greening the economy, ensuring first nations have potable water in every community, training workers for the new economy, housing, and early childhood education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478895">The Department of Finance recognizes that infrastructure investment has more than five times the economic impact that corporate income tax cuts have. This fact was published in an appendix to the 2009 budget. Canadians want action on job creation and real economic growth, not billions of dollars in corporate tax giveaways and cuts to services. Economists agree. Now is not the time to cut billions of dollars out of the economy. Strategic investment is required to support job creation and economic growth now and into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478896">New Democrats believe the best way to improve our economy and address our debt is through policies that would get Canadians back to work. This is no time to retrench. It is time for public investment. We can express confidence in the Canadian economy by undertaking the significant investments in infrastructure that are necessary for Canada to remain competitive in the future economy.</ParaText>

What we need to be doing right now is putting aside party differences and working together to find pragmatic solutions that encourage job creation, economic productivity and investments that will increase the expertise of our Canadian workers. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2478898">These solutions would include a new employee tax credit for employers who retain new hires for a year or more and a reduction in taxes for small businesses, not large corporations. It is small businesses that invest in job creation here at home. That is why we are urging the government to drop the small business tax rate from 11% to 9%. That two percentage point tax break would help create jobs and growth right here in our communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478899">We need a 21st-century energy strategy, but the Conservatives keep opting for an outdated approach. Canada will not progress if it continues to focus on developing gas and oil instead of clean technology, and that is going to harm both the environment and Canada's economy. It is time to build the economy of the future by investing in green infrastructure so that renewable energy is accessible throughout the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478900">The official opposition rises today to call upon the government to put politics aside and focus more on the horizon and less on drawing lines in the sand.

              <ParaText id="2478958">While the global economy may be turbulent and while too many Canadians are looking for work, Canadians can rest assured that our Conservative government has done, and will continue to do, everything possible to ensure we are in the best position to meet the challenges ahead. That is what Canadians want their government to do: stay focused on jobs and the economy, keep taxes low and respect their hard-earned tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478959">Our Conservative government gets that, and Canadians understand that we get that. That is why they gave us a majority government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478960">For instance, we, like Canadians, understand that small businesses are the heartbeat of the Canadian economy, and by helping them grow, we are helping create jobs in our local communities. That is why, in the next phase of Canada's economic action plan, we introduced a hiring credit for small business. This innovative job-creating measure will help an estimated 525,000 small businesses by giving them a leg up to expand and increase hiring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478961">The Canadian Federation of Independent Business labelled it an important step “...to enhance job creation and recognize the economic contributions of small businesses in Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478962">The NDP members, though, despite what they say today, actually voted against helping small businesses create jobs. That should not come as a great surprise, for the NDP has a very different take on the economy compared to our Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478963">While we are committed to a low-tax plan to help the economy and to help both large and small employers grow, the NDP believes in a tired tax-and-spend philosophy for the Canadian economy. The NDP believes in a far-left economic philosophy that claims Canadian families and businesses are just not paying enough taxes and need to send more of their hard-earned money to big government in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478964">In fact the Liberal finance critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, publicly proclaimed to the <I>The Chronicle-Herald</I> newspaper this past year that Canadians should be wary of the Marxist-Leninist views of the federal NDP when it comes to the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478965">While I will not repeat that sentiment completely, I will again point to some facts on the NDP's record on taxes for Canadians to consider. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478966">First and foremost, unlike the NDP, our Conservative government believes that leaving more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadians is the right thing to do, and we have the record to prove it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478967">Since coming to office in 2006, we have cut over 120 taxes, reducing taxes in every way government that collects them: personal, consumption, business, excise taxes and more. We removed over one million low-income Canadians completely from the tax rolls. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2478968">We reduced the overall tax burden to its lowest level in nearly 50 years. We introduced the tax free savings account, the most important personal savings vehicle since RRSPs. We lowered the GST from 7% to 5%. The overall total savings for a typical family is over $3,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478969">The NDP, on the other hand, has a proven record of pushing a high tax agenda by voting no again and again in the House of Commons against our tax relief. It has constantly protested and mocked our efforts to leave more money in the pockets of everyday Canadian families to help them pay the bills and to help businesses grow our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478970">Indeed, public statements by NDP MPs clearly underline their fundamental belief that Canadian families should be forced to send more and more of their hard-earned money to government. For example, here is what the NDP finance critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation>, had to say about our government's GST reduction. She stated, “Cuts to the GST...take us in the wrong direction. I am very proud that our caucus stood opposed to that--”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478971">Honestly, how many Canadians dealing with the costs of raising their families would appreciate politicians claiming that they are not just proud but very proud that they tried to prevent them from keeping more of their own hard-earned money? Is that the type of high tax thinking we want our politicians to have when it comes to the economy and protecting jobs? Clearly, the answer is a huge no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478972">As I mentioned earlier, Canada has weathered the global economic recession better than most other countries, but a big part of that has been our low tax plan, a low tax plan that has helped put an average of $3,000 back in the pockets of an average Canadian family. Another aspect of that low tax plan involves leaving more money in the hands of entrepreneurs and businesses to grow and hire more Canadians. Lower taxes make our economy stronger and create good, long-term jobs for today and tomorrow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478973">The Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters released a report, available online for all to see, confirming lower business taxes mean more jobs. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business unequivocally supports our low tax plan, which its says helps small business. Once again, I am using its words, “unequivocally supports”. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478976">Without a doubt, our Conservative government is focused on keeping taxes low and helping create jobs. The NDP wants to raise taxes, which essentially kills jobs. Specifically, as businesses try to deal with global economic turbulence, the NDP wants to slap a huge $10 billion a year tax hike on them as explicitly stated in its platform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478977">Let us be clear. A $10 billion a year NDP tax hike would mean losing good Canadian jobs and jeopardizing the financial security of hard-working Canadian families. I do not know what world the NDP is living in, but Canadians cannot afford that. They cannot afford higher taxes and they cannot afford the job killing policies of the NDP. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> may be very proud of the NDP supporting tax hikes, but Canadians are actually very scared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478978"> When it comes to taxes and the economy, our Conservative government's record is clear: lower taxes for a stronger economy. That is what we need. The NDP record is even clearer, higher taxes and more reckless spending, something we do not need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478979">Moreover, unlike the NDP and this hastily thrown together motion on the economy today, our Conservative government has a well-developed plan for jobs and growth that we have been implementing. Canada's economic action plan and its next phase is that plan. Despite the fact that the NDP voted against it every step of the way, this plan is working and it is getting results. Yes, like other countries, we face global economic headwinds from Europe and the United States, but we are ready and able to address them as we have done so previously. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2478980">I would, therefore, encourage all members to stick with the next phase of Canada's economic action plan. Do not listen to the misinformation that is being perpetrated. Look at the facts. As I have challenged the NDP here today, put the facts on the table. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478981">I encourage Canadians to listen to the economists, to global leaders, and to Canadians, when they say, this is the plan to follow, this will keep our country safe, this will protect jobs, and this will create jobs. I encourage them to remain on track with this Conservative government in the interests of this wonderful country of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478983"> We are saying we have a plan to put Canadians back to work, the two million Canadians who are desperate for a job. I think they expect us to get to work on that, to roll up our sleeves and get to work. The average Canadian family benefits by about $16,000 from the services that they get from various levels of government.

The NDP seems to come up with these numbers from thin air. However, let me give the appropriate numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478987">There have been nearly 600,000 jobs created under this government's watch since the recession hit. This government is committed to ensuring we protect Canadian jobs, ensuring we create Canadian jobs.

              <ParaText id="2478988">I need to remind this House of what Catherine Swift, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, stated when discussing one of the NDP's proposals to double CPP premiums in its efforts to protect jobs. Here is what Catherine Swift in fact said, “That would mean probably about a 60% to 70% increase in premiums from what we understand, and that was very, very worrisome. So any tax breaks that were in the NDP platform were grossly outmatched but what they were going to ding small business on that CPP alone”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2478991">Madam Speaker, it is a matter of arithmetic that the latest budget, budget 2011, is a net destroyer of jobs. If we actually look at the numbers in the budget, on the spending side the Conservatives have measures worth $500 million over two years, or only $200 million if we exclude the $300 million given to AECL. So, the measures that they keep boasting about are $200 million to $500 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478992">Turn a few pages in the budget and we get to the cuts. What are the cuts over these same two years? Two billion dollars. They are cutting $2 billion and they are adding $200 million to $500 million so, obviously, net, they are destroying more jobs than they are creating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2478993">This is wrong-headed at this time. If we look to what the IMF has said, if we look to what the chief economist of BMO has said, it is not appropriate to destroy jobs at a time when the world economy is likely heading back into a recession.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479011">Time and again, we hear the Conservatives bragging about the job situation in Canada. It shows how out of touch they are with many Canadians. Under the Conservatives, unemployment is actually up. In fact, it is harder to find a job today than it was when the Conservatives first took office. That is because, under the Conservatives, job creation in Canada is simply not keeping up with our population growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479012">Today, 1.4 million Canadians are out of work and looking for a job. That is 344,000 more unemployed Canadians compared with just before the recession. That is 213,000 more unemployed Canadians than when the Conservatives first took office. Canada's unemployment rate is now 7.3% and that does not include the thousands of Canadians who have simply given up looking for work. We do not see any real plan from the Conservatives to create jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479013">Our national employment figures also do not tell the whole story. If we go into regions of the country, for instance the Maritimes and Ontario and Quebec, we see a very different picture from what we see in resource-rich provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479014">As an example, let us look at London, Ontario, which is an area represented by both Conservative and NDP members of Parliament. In London, there are 6,800 fewer net jobs now compared with before the recession. There are 10,700 more people out of work and the unemployment rate is now 9.3%. That is almost three points higher than it was before the recession. Yet, we hear the Conservatives telling these unemployed Canadians that everything is fine, when, in fact, unemployed Canadians and their families are suffering and struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479015">In my own economic region of the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia, the counties of Hants, Kings and Annapolis are represented by me as a Liberal member of Parliament and by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170621" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, a Conservative member of Parliament. This Statistics Canada catchment area has 5,500 fewer net jobs today compared with before the recession in 2008. There are now 2,200 more people who are unemployed and looking for work and the local unemployment rate has gone from 5% to almost 9%. In regions like these, too many Canadians have lost full-time jobs and have seen their full-time jobs, in many cases, replaced by part-time work. It is hard to pay bills, put food on the table, take care of a family or save for retirement or university or college for their children with part-time work and no benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479016"> One way Canadians have tried to make ends meet is to extend credit lines. Now the average Canadian family owes more than $1.50 for every dollar of annual income. People are feeling squeezed and that is with interest rates at historic lows. They are scared to death to think of what will happen when interest rates inevitably, in time, increase. That is a reality faced by too many Canadians. What is taking place under the Conservatives' watch is that this situation is getting worse and the Conservatives are become more out of touch with reality.</ParaText>

              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479024">It is interesting that in the first three years of office, the Conservatives actually increased spending by 18%, three times the rate of inflation, and they put Canada into deficit with their massive spending increases even before the recession began. During the good times, when the market was providing all kinds of growth for the Canadian economy, the Conservatives were spending. Now, during the tough times, when the market is contracting and investments are drying up, the Conservatives are cutting. It makes no sense and there is no economist who agrees with what they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479025">The Conservatives spent the cupboard bare during the good times and they eliminated the rainy day fund that was set aside by the previous Liberal government. They wasted taxpayer money on everything from partisan advertising and high-priced consultants, to the G8 and G20 billion dollar boondoggle and now, with the economy teetering on the edge of a recession, the Conservatives finally have discovered austerity. This approach ramping up spending in the good times and cutting spending when Canadians are out work is wrong-headed.</ParaText>

We were totally accountable and we did it with the support of the public service in an open and transparent manner. We published a detailed breakdown and explanation of the savings on a website for all Canadians to see. Again, we did this so that taxpayer money could be reinvested in priorities, including health care and infrastructure.

              <ParaText id="2479055">Madam Speaker, I am happy to join in this important debate. I congratulate New Democrats for bringing this important issue forward. There are a variety of things to touch on, but overall it is one of the issues that we all care about, whether it is pensions, or infrastructure investments, or the economy. We will continue to work on behalf of all Canadians to bring these kinds of issues forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479056">Given the urgency and the importance of the subject, I would have liked to have seen more time devoted to pensions, an issue that I have been involved in for a couple of years now as the pension critic. I look forward to finding ways to improve Canadians' retirement years. The clock is ticking on this issue, and if the government fails to act, which is clearly what we have seen so far, then it may be too late to avoid many of the problems that our aging population will have to face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479057">Pension security, coverage and adequacy are issues that I have worked on for a while. Last May in the House, I prompted a take note debate on pension security, hoping the government would take notice and act on the looming pension crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479058">Why have I been pushing this? Not only because I am the critic, but because Canada is a nation rich with resources and potential and our citizens should be able to enjoy a measure of dignity during retirement. I have a weekly meeting in my office with seniors who are struggling, and it is quite a shock to realize how little they have to live on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479059">More than 200,000 Canadians over the age of 65 continue to live below the poverty line. What that really means is that after a lifetime of working to raise their family, paying their taxes, 200,000 Canadians are being forced to choose between buying groceries or paying the rent because their retirement income is simply too low to allow them to do both. This covers a lot of people, whether it is a woman who chooses to stay at home to raise her children or someone caring for an elderly relative. A variety of people have been caught in a certain portion. In the last election, the government introduced a bit of help, but that only covered a small amount of people. People going into retirement are thinking they are going to have a blissful life, but they are clearly finding out that living on $14,000 a year is a difficult struggle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479060">In response, the daily goal that should be set by the present government, or any other Government of Canada for that matter, is to eliminate of that wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479061">How do we do that? For a start, we need to get serious about pension security, coverage and adequacy before we see more situations such as the one which is still threatening 17,000 former employees of Nortel. The House spent a lot of time last year talking about it. As the opposition, we asked a lot of questions. Many Nortel employees continue to struggle. Those 17,000 people worked for a lifetime, paid their taxes, put money away for a rainy day, but despite all of their efforts, they saw their savings wash away because of inadequate legal protections in our system. They were promised action, but the government continues to ignore these important people and their financial security. Thousands of others in Canada could be threatened in the event that a company goes bankrupt and they have no pension protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479062">Historically speaking, prior to the Great Depression, most Canadian social services were delivered by a patchwork group of religious, volunteer and charitable organizations. The reality is that today, in addition to being essential for basic living, many Canadians view pensions as defining elements of our national identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479063">In 1927 Liberal prime minister Sir William Lyon Mackenzie King approved the old age pension plan. In 1963 Liberal prime minister Lester Pearson began working on the Canada pension plan. The Conservatives stood firmly in opposition to the idea of retirement income security for working Canadians, with the ideology that they could take care of themselves. Imagine where we would be today if we did not have old age security and, most important, if we did not have the Canada pension plan. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479064">As I said earlier, the Conservative Party has a long history of opposing improvements to it. Conservatives opposed the Liberal old pension. They opposed the Liberal idea of the Canada pension plan. They opposed helping the former employees of Nortel, including pensioners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479065">The real sad part of it was that there was a group of Nortel employees on long-term disability. We had a bill before the House and the Senate that would have helped that small segment of people. However, the Conservatives brought in more Conservative senators and voted down that bill. It would have helped a small segment of people. One of the men who appeared before the committees of the House of Commons and the Senate several times died shortly after, a sad, desperate man. Today we continue to hear very little about real pension reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479066">Where do we go from here? On October 13, 2010, I presented a white paper on pension reform and I sent a copy of it to the government, because it had a lot of good ideas. I imagine, if the Conservatives can distance themselves from the Liberals, they will try to implement some of them as long as they can take credit for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479067">I want to see improvements done, and if the Conservatives pick up some of those comments in the white paper and move them forward, I am happy to congratulate them for doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479068">However, it is time again to see that kind of national leadership shown by Mackenzie King, Pearson and by Mr. Chrétien, who put the Canada pension plan back on a stable footing for nearly a century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479069">Most Canadian seniors are eligible for old age security and most former workers can receive Canada pension plan or the Quebec pension plan benefits, based on their contributions during the course of their careers. Those on the lowest end of the income scale are also eligible for the guaranteed income supplement. Alone, these mechanisms provide somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30% of one's replacement income in retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479070">In dollars, these plans pay a maximum of about $20,000 annually, if we are lucky, but the average payouts continue to be significantly less. Current economics suggest that this will not be enough for most Canadians, who will need private retirement savings to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479071">A number of Canadians do have a private pension through their employer and take advantage of government tax shelters such as RRSPs or tax-free savings accounts. However, recent events have called the security of these private investments into question. I believe, as Canadians, as parliamentarians, we can find better solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479072">In the past few years alone we have seen a number of private companies become insolvent. Once that occurs, it would seem that employee pension plans are inadequately protected under current Canadian law. When markets crash, things like Nortel happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479073">Despite repeated calls for action, the government seems willing to sit back and allow the market to do as it will with these people. Again, the same ideology: let people take care of themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479074">The undeniable fact is that over the next 20 to 30 years, Canadian pension regimes will face a perfect storm of an aging population, longer lifespans, dramatically higher levels of personal debt coupled with lower disposable incomes and global, economic and market instability. Therefore, steps must be taken in the short term if pension security, adequacy and coverage are to be attainable in the long term for many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479075">In an effort to ensure that Canada's retirement income system is prepared for this challenge, I would suggest that adopting a multi-pronged, internally coherent strategy that would shore up our system would be mindful of several key principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479076">First, we need to underscore the value of a functioning pension system, and I strongly feel that the reliable retirement income regime is in everyone's best interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479077">Second, we should be rethinking the three pillars of the existing pension system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479078">Third, we should consider the integration of existing systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479079">Consideration must also be given to those who have traditionally fallen through the cracks. In particular, women who statistically endure a greater rate of poverty due largely to factors involving longevity, employment type and tenure, must receive the attention needed to ensure retirement income security, adequacy and coverage on par with all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479080">With these principles in mind, my white paper proposes several specific recommendations to help ensure Canada's pension and retirement savings structures are fortified in a way so as to ensure they are prepared for the anticipated storm.</ParaText>

If there is no long-term plan so Canadians can have a decent retirement, then we are letting them all down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479087">As far as our ability to balance cutting the budget and continuing to invest in infrastructure, in 1993, when we came into power, there was a $42 billion deficit as a result of the Conservative government. We made the changes we needed to make and we made the hard decisions that were necessary. However, we are in a very unique time. There are severe problems around the world. Her government said that it would never run a deficit or get into a recession. Both of those things, we clearly know now, came true.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479089">Could the member tell us what her view is on the pooled pension plan idea offered by the government?

              <ParaText id="2479090">Madam Speaker, the market is good and healthy if it has a lot of options, but clearly the option the government has put forward is an opportunity for insurance companies and banks to make money, which is great as this is free enterprise, but it will not help with the real problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479091"> Liberals have put forward the idea of a supplementary Canada pension plan that would allow people to put away a small amount of money. They can put $50 a month into their supplementary plan and their employers, if they choose, could add a few extra dollars. Homemakers would be able to put a few extra dollars aside to try to catch up for the years they were not in the workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479092">A supplementary Canada pension plan would be voluntary. It would be run by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and would not require employers to add contributions, though they could if they wanted to. Otherwise, it would provide a safe vehicle that would be administered with low interest rates, would be well managed and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board indicated it could administer a supplementary plan with very little problem.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479094">I rise today to speak in favour of our party's opposition day motion which calls on the government to take swift action with regard to the economy. First, I would like to commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> for all her hard work on this important issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479095">As the Conservatives boast about their economic action plan, Canadian families know that times are still tough for them and they want the government to take meaningful action that gets them back to work. Rather than the billions of dollars in cuts to services and departments which the government is proposing, New Democrats believe that now is the time to provide targeted incentives for real job creators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479096"> Even the Department of Finance has noted that infrastructure investment has more than five times the economic impact than corporate tax cuts. Yet, the government continues to follow unsustainable and unfair economic policies that have shown to be ineffective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479097">An excellent example of infrastructure investment which the government could do immediately is to work with provinces and municipalities to provide badly needed public transit systems. Communities across Canada are dealing with major shortfalls in transit funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479098"> New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody have been waiting for the Evergreen Line for over 20 years. It has been plagued by delays since the early 1990s. My community is one of the fastest growing regions in British Columbia with a high rate of commuters who travel to work. There is a severe lack of public transit. This infrastructure project is a necessary component for our long-term regional plan. Traffic congestion is a problem for many residents in my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479099">The Evergreen Line is expected to serve 70,000 people a day by 2021. Canada needs to transition toward a low-carbon future. The Evergreen Line is critical for my neighbourhood to meet future challenges associated with climate change and rising energy costs. The Evergreen Line is projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air contaminants from cars by 4.7 million tonnes cumulatively by 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479100">One of the best things we can do for our economy is to invest in infrastructure projects that are needed to service our communities. The Evergreen Line would create approximately 9,000 construction jobs in my community. These jobs are needed now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479101">I call on the federal government to increase its investment in the Evergreen Line. The shortfall in funding falls on local taxpayers who are constantly being asked to pay more for vital infrastructure programs. It would be an excellent initiative for the federal government to increase its contribution to fund the gap and build the line. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479102">The Evergreen Line is an example of why we need to adopt the New Democrats' proposed legislation that would create a national transit strategy in this country. The International Monetary Fund is predicting that unemployment will only continue to rise if swift action is not taken. Investing in public transit is an excellent way to create jobs and move us forward toward a sustainable future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479103">Small business is a major economic driver in Canada and in my riding of New Westminster--Coquitlam and Port Moody. In Canada, over one million small businesses employ over 50% of the workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479104">The federal government must support small businesses because it has become increasingly evident that they are the ones investing in domestic job creation. Yet, the government continues to reward large corporations with tax cuts, which tend to ship their jobs overseas, and does not do enough for small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479105">Canada's New Democrats have called on the federal government to reduce the small business tax rate from 11% to 9%. This would help create jobs in communities right across the country. We also propose that employers who hire new employees get a tax credit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479106">Canada has a real opportunity to build the economy of the future by investing in vital green infrastructure. We also need to invest in research and technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479107">The government continues to emphasize the expansion of oil and gas, while I believe we need to move into the 21st century and invest in a transition to cleaner technologies and energy supply. If we do not move forward with green energy and technology, I fear Canada will be left behind. Other nations are moving in this direction. If we want to compete, we must understand that our reliance on conventional oil and gas as a major driver of our economy must change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479108">There are many initiatives the government could pursue to assist people with retrofitting homes and buildings. When the eco-energy retrofit program was cancelled, I called on the government to reinstate it. This program helped thousands of Canadians renovate their homes, cut home heating costs and save an estimated three tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per home, or 1.5 million tonnes of emissions after four years of retrofitting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479109">The eco-energy retrofit program not only created jobs, but helped working families make needed improvements to their homes. I was pleased when the government brought back this excellent program. However, I believe it can be expanded and made more accessible to Canadians right across the country. We can work with industry and commercial enterprises to retrofit their buildings. We can better work with homeowners to help insulate their homes and drive down their reliance on energy. This would create jobs, would be good for the environment, and would help lower energy costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479110">The primary economic problem in Canada is a slow economic recovery and a weak job market. The current job market remains weaker than before the financial crisis in October 2008. The unemployment rate is up to 7.3%. Many of the new jobs of which the government speaks are part-time positions. If we actually take into account the real unemployment rate, which includes people who have dropped out of the labour force and involuntary part-time workers, the unemployment rate in July of this year would have been 11.1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479111">The youth unemployment rate is also alarming. This past summer, student unemployment hit 17.2%. This is higher than the previous summer and is up from 14% prior to the recession. Students are not earning the money they need to attend post-secondary school. They are incurring more debt than ever before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479112">Our most important investment is our future, and that includes ensuring our children have the ability to gain the skills needed from good-paying jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479113">There is another issue I would like to address that is having a negative impact in my riding and in the regional area of southwestern British Columbia and Vancouver. I am very concerned with the proposed changes to Service Canada, including the proposed closure of offices across the country and the reduction of staff which will have a negative impact with regard to employment insurance cases. Given the chronic staff shortage and current hiring freeze at employment insurance client services, the proposal to cut budgets, close offices and lay off workers is alarming. Levels of service are already unacceptable with wait times increasing weekly and clients often not able to make contact with an agent. There is a large backlog which is reflected in calls that we have received at my constituency office. I have been contacted by constituents who struggle to buy food and pay the rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479114">This is a horrible situation for people who find themselves out of work and have to turn to government for assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479115">Service Canada, in particular EI, needs increased resources, not cuts, to ensure that it continues to be effective and responsive to the needs of Canadians especially in these difficult times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479116">Canadians want public investment. They want the government to take swift action to create jobs. This is critical in order to have healthy, sustainable and stable communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479139">We know there are a variety of statistics, but one that we really need to pay attention to is that the official unemployment numbers in Canada are around 1.4 million Canadians and that is closer to two million when we include those who are discouraged or unemployed. This unemployment rate represents lost wages of more than $20 billion and that does not include the lost economic stimulus and tax revenues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479140">When we talk about these numbers, we hear from the government about all the jobs that are created, yet in an article by the <I>Catalyst</I> in the summer of 2011, it indicated there are approximately four million Canadians living in poverty, many of them despite having a job. It poses the question, why? It says there are not enough full-time well paying jobs. Nearly one million Canadians are working part-time involuntarily. Their jobs are increasingly characterized by instability and insecurity, few or no workplace benefits and little or no access to government benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479141">We know that when people do not have stable employment, that contributes to economic uncertainty in their lives and makes it more difficult for them to contribute to the local economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479142">In addition to these persistent rates of involuntary unemployment or unstable unemployment, we also have an increasing income gap in this country. According to the Conference Board of Canada in a news release, it said that:</ParaText>

The challenge with this income inequality is just not a problem in terms of the poor which is what we often think about this, it is a problem for each and every Canadian. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479147">In the article it indicated that Canada's top 100 CEOs have seen a 13% year-over-year jump in average pay, rising to an average of $6 million. In contrast, the average earnings of employed Canadians has fallen to $38,500. Things are better for full-time year-round workers, but not by much. Median earnings inched up from $44,100 to $45,600 and in inflation-adjusted terms, not over the last year, but since 1976, and this translates into a $1,500 increase after 33 years. We all know the costs of everything have risen much more than $1,500 in the last 33 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479148">In the same article, it translates this into what this actually means for Canadians. Since one of our targets is youth, I want to talk about what it is like for youths. In this article the author said, “I see it in my own life. Back in 1979, it took six weeks working the minimum wage full-time to cover my full-time undergraduate tuition in Toronto”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479149">She went on to say, “Today's typical student in Ontario has to work 16 weeks”, that is 10 weeks more, “at the minimum wage to cover just the cost of tuition, let alone anything else. Yet most are still frozen out of the job market, with 180,000 fewer 15 to 24-year-olds employed across Canada than when the debt crisis broke in 2008”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479150">This income equality is not just about CEOs getting way more than the rest of us, but it is about the real impact on young people and everyone else who is working in the current economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479151">In addition, one of the things we often hear when we are talking about raising people out of poverty is the government referring to it as spending.

              <ParaText id="2479161">It would seem that a good start for the government would actually be to support Bill <Document DbId="5090251" Type="4">C-233</Document>, my bill on income inequality, which lays out a strategy for national poverty reduction in this country. The NDP does have good concrete ideas on how to tackle some of these problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479162">I want to switch now, in my brief few minutes left, to talk about national childcare and early learning. In the same report from the National Council on Welfare, it wanted to give a good concrete example of why investing in national childcare makes good economic sense. It is not just about looking after children and giving parents options in terms of being able to go back to work. It wanted to talk about the economy of it all. It says that provincially, Quebec's universal $7-a-day childcare program is credited for cutting the poverty rate of single-parent families by 15 percentage points between 1997 and 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479163">We in Canada are fortunate enough to actually have a provincial childcare program in place that gives us some real meaningful data on what the impact is on the provincial GDP. We actually have a study that has been done on this and it was called “The Economic Consequences of Quebec's Educational Childcare Policy”. I want to just read some of these numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479164">There are three macroeconomic impacts. Quebec's ECEC program has had major macroeconomic consequences on women's labour force participation, on gross provincial income and on federal and provincial finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479165">First let us talk about the impact on taxes and transfers. Increased family incomes generate more tax revenues and lower government transfers and credits. All types of tax revenues increase not only income and payroll taxes but all levels of government benefit, not only at the provincial level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479166">For the longer term, the effects will be larger still. These are some short-term effects that the article predicted. On net, for every dollar spent on ECEC, the provincial government harvests $1.05 and the federal government gets 44¢ for nothing. This is because of the increased income. People are paying provincial and federal income tax, so the government, not investing in a program in Quebec, gets 44¢ for doing nothing. This persistent effect will probably grow over time as pre-ECEC mothers, aged 50-65, are replaced by post-ECEC mothers. This implies that the long-term effects on the growth of provincial income and government net revenues will also be larger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479167">In summary, by 2008, Quebec's ECEC program had increased women's employment by 70,000, that is plus-3.8%; had increased provincial GDP by $5.2 billion; and was entirely self-financing within the provincial budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479168">Clearly, here we have a good solid economic case for investing in a national childcare program and an early learning strategy. Other data indicate that for every dollar we spend in the ages of zero to six we actually save $7 in the long run, whether it is on the justice system, on education, on income assistance, or on health care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479190">I can understand the member's concern about the economy and its effects on the lives of Canadians. Our government has been clear that our priority is job creation. I can assure the member that our government remains focused on our low-tax plan to create jobs and economic growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479191">However, Canada does not stand alone in the world. We are aware that when our closest trading partner, the United States, is experiencing considerable slowdown in the pace of GDP growth--from 3% in the first six quarters of the recovery to only 0.4% in the first quarter of 2011--there can be an effect on Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479192">It is because of Canada's job creation ability in these fragile economic times that we have had the confidence that our government's approach is the right one. In the first eight months of 2011, Canada realized employment gains of over 193,000 jobs, and close to 600,000 new jobs have been created since July 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479193">While Canada's unemployment rate increased by 0.1% in August, we are currently experiencing the lowest levels of unemployment since January 2009. In many regions of the country, from south central Ontario to Quebec City to Saskatoon and Regina, we are seeing significantly lower levels of unemployment. We are seeing the signs of economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479194">Under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the economic action plan helped Canada respond to the global economic recession. Let me reflect on some of those programs that helped us respond in these fragile economic times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479195">Our government is dedicated to improving opportunity for Canadians through skills development. Employers increasingly require highly skilled workers who are adaptable and willing to learn. We recognize that it is more important than ever for young people to gain skills and experience to prepare for and succeed in the jobs of tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479196">Our youth employment programs are part of the Government of Canada strategy to create the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world. The Government of Canada understands that helping young Canadians prepare for the jobs of tomorrow is important, especially during these hard economic times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479197">That is why in 2011 we permanently increased the budget for Canada's summer jobs to $10 million. The additional funding created 3,500 additional jobs for students this summer across the country, thereby strengthening our local economies and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479198">Under the 2010 budget, our government committed an additional $60 million to the skills link and career focus programs within the youth employment strategy. Through this additional support, we are helping more vulnerable youth, including high school dropouts and single parents, gain the skills and experience they need to access the labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479199">In the economic action plan and previous budgets, our government has acted to make post-secondary education and training more accessible for Canadians. For example, in budget 2011, it will help more students and low- and middle-income families get the skills and education to succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479200">Some of these initiatives include the following: allowing students to work more without affecting their student loans, allowing part-time students to have higher family incomes without affecting their eligibility for a Canada student loan and increasing the eligibility of a part-time student to access the Canada student loans program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479201">The Canada student loans program is a program I am proud to support, and I know first-hand its incredible benefit. Having been a recipient of the program myself, I was able to put myself through university, go to medical school and eventually become a pediatric orthopedic surgeon and help countless students and families' children. I know the tangible results of this program. I am proud that our Conservative government continues to support it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479202">These and other initiatives can be found under canlearn.ca, a great resource tool for Canadians, especially for those young Canadians who are applying for work and programs and scholarships and who need to find information on programs and financial assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479203">Employers in communities across Canada and around the world are always looking for workers with the best skills and talent. That is why the Government of Canada encourages people to enter the trades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479204">We created the apprenticeship incentive grant program, which helps Canadians pursue their apprenticeship training. This grant is a $1,000 taxable cash grant available to registered apprentices upon completion of their first or second year of an apprenticeship program in a designated Red Seal trade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479205">To date over 195,000 apprenticeship incentive grants have been issued, and under the economic action plan we have now made apprenticeships even more attractive. These grants are a necessary component of our job strategy, and they are designed to improve accessibility to apprenticeships and to encourage the apprenticeship process and programs so that those individuals who want to work can find those full-time jobs in their respective trades.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479206">We are offering the apprenticeship completion grant introduced in Canada's economic action plan to encourage Canadians to complete their apprenticeship training and receive certification in a designated Red Seal trade. The Red Seal is widely recognized and respected as an industry standard of excellence in the trades, and our apprenticeship grants program ensures our apprentices continue their progress toward that goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479207">The apprenticeship completion grant is a $2,000 taxable cash grant available to apprentices who complete their program and receive a journey person certificate on or after January 1, 2009. So far we have issued over 44,000 completed grants. Our government is committed to supporting hard-working individuals who work toward that goal and complete it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479208">With each of the apprenticeship grants, an apprentice can receive up to a total of $4,000 in grants from both of these programs. While the statistics and program descriptions are necessary, the great news for Canadians is that there is nothing better than hearing from Canadians as they describe the concrete benefits of these programs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479209">In my riding of Simcoe—Grey, Tim Young, the owner of Steer Enterprises in Glen Huron, is one such individual whose hard work and dedication helps him to grow his business by utilizing the apprenticeship grants program offered by the Conservative government. Currently he has three apprentices working in his company, but over the course of this program he has utilized the apprenticeship grant program offered by our government to the tune of up to 50 apprentices. These apprentices are now all getting their first successful jobs so they can move forward. These are real results and benefits, and precisely the things we need to be focused on so that Canadians can be successful. I encourage any young Canadian who is considering the trades to apply for these grants. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479210">Through our targeted initiative for older workers, our government has helped over 16,000 older workers to find new skills and employment to help them transition at a vulnerable point in their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479211">In the first phase of Canada's economic action plan, we provided an extra five weeks of employment insurance benefits to 1.1 million claimants. We also helped 190,000 long-tenured workers receive extended EI benefits and we provided career transition assistance to support longer-term training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479212">We make work-sharing more flexible. In response to the recent economic downturn, our Conservative government temporarily extended the maximum duration of work-sharing agreements to 52 weeks, eased requirements for employers' recovery plans and streamlined application processes. More than 298,000 individuals have benefited from over 10,800 work-sharing agreements from February 2009 to September 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479213">Our government's work-sharing program is designed to help employers facing a temporary downturn in business to avert layoffs, and the results are clear: our program is working. Work-sharing provides a win-win circumstance for everyone involved, and our government is committed to supporting this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479214">Canadians continue to enjoy the dignity that comes with a job. Employers are able to address a reduced requirement for labour, and at the end of the day people who otherwise would accept unemployment insurance benefits are attached to the workforce and continue to contribute to Canada's economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479215">We extended the targeted initiative for older workers by $50 million over two years in the 2011 budget. This program is a federal-provincial-territorial cost-shared initiative designed to provide support to unemployed older workers in communities affected by significant downsizing or high unemployment. These programs are normally coordinated by community-based organizations and offer a combination of approaches that include skills training, work experience and assistance to become self-employed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479216">Older workers are valuable to our economy. They provide experience and skills and stability. They have helped build our country over the years and have contributed to our society and our economy. We need to ensure that their transition out of the workforce and into retirement is a smooth and trouble-free one that they enjoy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479217">Our government has also invested $420 million to renew two EI pilot programs for one year. These include working while on claim pilot projects and the best-14-weeks pilot project. The purpose of an EI pilot project is to test, for a definitive period of time, changes to the EI program. The goal is to make it more consistent with current employment practices and trends in order to improve service to the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479218">The working while on claim pilot increases the working while on claim threshold to allow individuals to earn greater than $75 or 40% of their benefits and tests whether this increased threshold will provide a greater incentive for individuals to accept all available work while receiving EI benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479219">The best-14-weeks program calculates EI benefits based on the best 14 weeks of earnings over a 52-week period. It tests whether this approach encourages claimants to accept all available work prior to establishing a claim.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479220">Furthermore, we enhanced the wage earner protection program. We are extending this program to employees who lost their jobs when their employers attempted restructuring. It takes into account the six-month and the end of bankruptcy or receivership time program. This will cost about $4.5 million annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479221">In my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour, I can speak to the next phase of the economic action plan. We saw a $1 million investment over two years to expand the delivery of our preventive mediation program. The goal of this program is to help employers and unions move from adversarial to collaborative relationships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479222">Let me conclude by talking about Stephen Cecchin, who participated in the skills link program as an apprenticeship builder. Previously Stephen worked in seasonal and part-time jobs that did not provide him with much of the skills training he needed to advance his career. After participating in the Niagara Peninsula homes employment project, he was offered an apprenticeship with an electrical contractor. That is the break he needed. Now he is looking forward to building a better future for himself and his family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479223">Our government is working hard on making sure Canadian workers and their families can gain the skills and training they require to create opportunities for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479224">Canadians are not asking government to create makeshift jobs. What they want is a government that believes in them and will help them with building their future. Canadians are not looking for a handout; they are looking for a hand up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479225">As we saw in the last election, Canadians overwhelmingly supported this government's low-tax plan for jobs and economic growth.

              <ParaText id="2479257">I would first like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> for her excellent motion that summarizes the NDP's positions very well and contrasts them with the Conservatives' values and priorities. I would also like to remind my Conservative colleagues on the other side of the House that Quebeckers gave the NDP a strong mandate to represent them over the next four years. They must take this into consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479258">In discussing this motion, members are making many references to the uncertain financial and economic situation in Canada in the next few years. A number of financial institutions are concerned about the economy. I am referring to the International Monetary Fund, for example, which is forecasting that Canada's unemployment rate will rise again this year. Therefore, it is very problematic that the Conservatives are telling us that Canada's economy is in good shape, that we should not worry, and that we should have faith in them. We see that it is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479259">The International Monetary Fund also indicated that the economy would grow much more slowly than forecast. That is another sign that greatly worries the NDP. The organization also revised downwards its forecasts for Canada's economic growth, now estimated at 2.1% for this year and 1.9% for next year. Those watching know very well that the cost of living is increasing at a higher rate, which suggests that there may be another recession. It is very worrisome because we have not yet bounced back from the 2008 recession. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479260">That is why the NDP believes that the absolute priority must be to not cut stimulus funding, but instead to invest in the Canadian economy. This would be carried out in two main ways, although there are others, including investing in infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479261">I will speak a little about my region, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. My riding includes nine municipalities. During the spring and summer, I met with some of the mayors, and many of them talked to me about their tremendous infrastructure needs. My region is not particularly urban. It is primarily rural. Many small municipalities have limited administrative and financial means. That is why it is important for the Conservative government to invest in small municipalities across Canada, Quebec and Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. It would be very welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479262">However, I get very worried when I see that the Conservatives want to cut stimulus funding. In Canada, infrastructure is very important, and I am concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479263">Other organizations agree with the NDP's calls for the Conservatives to maintain stimulus funding. BMO's chief economist, Sherry Cooper, said that this is not the time for the government to adopt austerity measures. I completely agree with Dr. Cooper. I remember a few years ago Canada was in a good economic position and had a surplus. That was the time to reduce our debt, to reduce our deficit. Today, we have still not yet recovered from the 2008 recession. So it is very important to continue to invest in infrastructure and worker transition programs, and to invest money in targeted sectors where employment can be stimulated. All of these measures will strengthen the Canadian economy in the coming years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479264">Sherry Cooper added that the misplaced belief that the road to economic prosperity is paved with near-term fiscal tightening, as espoused by our own Prime Minister and the British Prime Minister, shows we have learned nothing from Herbert Hoover's inappropriate response to the Great Depression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479265">The NDP is not alone in calling on the government to think again about its second phase of Canada's economic action plan. TD Economics has also said that any unexpected downward shift in the markets could plunge Canada into another recession.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479266">That is worrisome. I can just imagine what Canadians at home who lost their jobs during the recession are going through. If they are lucky, they found a job that is likely less stable and lower-paid and now they see all these economic leaders announcing that they might have to relive everything they have gone through in the last few years. That is very troubling. I urge the Conservatives to take this into consideration and remain flexible in their economic stimulus program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479267">What is more, Scotiabank has said that “we're faced with the distinct possibility that the Canadian economy could be the first to stumble”. I do not really understand why the Conservatives tell us from time to time that the economic situation in Canada is good, to trust them and that they received a strong mandate from the Canadian public. Canadians and Quebeckers are not blind. I would kindly ask the Conservatives to review their economic action plan and to take into consideration not only what we in the NDP are saying, but also what Canadian economic leaders are saying about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479268">Scotiabank has also published a report saying that the Canadian economy could enter a recession even without a further unexpected drop in the U.S. economy. We know that the U.S. economy has already had many problems with regard to economic recovery, which is very slow. Again, according to Scotiabank, even without a decline in the U.S. stock market and real estate market, Canada could enter into another recession. That worries me greatly. In my region we have a high rate of unemployment. Many of the jobs are not secure. I am really worried about Canada's economic situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479269">Then there is the Conference Board of Canada. Glen Hodgson indicated this week, at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Finance, that this is not the right time for the government to cut spending. He emphasized the fact that the government should remain flexible in its approach. That is what the NDP and I are asking of the Conservatives. He also repeated a number of times that tax expenditure—in other words, the inefficient tax cuts the Conservatives are giving to corporations—should be included in the scrutiny of government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479270">The Bank of Canada is very reputable. I encourage the Conservatives to pay attention to what the Bank of Canada is saying and what it is doing. The Bank of Canada is also very worried about Canada's economic situation. And for that very reason, it recently decided not to harm the economy by reducing demand. Thus, it kept interest rates low. It is very important for the Canadian economy that interest rates remain low to encourage spending and exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479271">However, the government really needs to be doing its part by investing in the Canadian economy and in infrastructure. Private investments are limited right now because private companies are worried about the same things that concern the NDP when it comes to the Canadian economy. Companies are not yet ready to invest their hard-earned money for fear that another recession is coming and they will lose money. That is why it is so important that the Conservative government set an example and fund infrastructure programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479272">I want to share some key numbers. I know how much the government likes numbers. I will tell it like it is; I will read out the real numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479273">The number of officially unemployed Canadians is still 1.4 million. If we include those who are discouraged or underemployed, that number is closer to 2 million. So, 2 million people in Canada are out of work. That is very worrying.That is the reason the NDP wants so much to stimulate the economy. We want the government to invest in small business. We spoke about that last spring. It is important for us that the government cut the small business tax rate by 2%. Small businesses in Canada create more than half of all new jobs. By investing in this sector rather than in large corporations, Canada will be able to create jobs, sustainable jobs. It will solve the problem of the Canadian economic crisis and instability.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479278">Mr. Speaker, the Conservative member's question leaves me a little perplexed because, to my knowledge, this is not Europe. Unlike the Conservatives, who refused our request, we in the NDP want to reduce the tax rate for small business. We do not want to raise taxes; we want to lower them for small businesses. Instead of 11% for small businesses, we would like to reduce that by 2 percentage points to 9%. This 2% difference would give small businesses the flexibility they need to hire new employees. This would do a world of good, especially in small towns. Anyone who is just starting up a small business does not want a high tax rate. The first five years are already difficult enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479279">In short, this is not Europe and the NDP wants to lower taxes for Canadians who own small businesses.</ParaText>

Personally, I truly believe that we need to focus on the green economy for Canada's economic future, and there are several ways we can do so, unlike the Conservatives who are stubbornly clinging to the world of the 20th century and continuing to encourage the use of oil and gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479285">We need to support green energy in every way we can. Quebec strongly supports hydroelectricity, a renewable energy source. These positive measures will ensure the sustainability of Canada's economic and energy future. I agree that we need to invest in the green economy. I simply do not understand why the Conservatives do not realize that if they want Canadians to get ahead of other nations, the government needs to invest in green energy sources like wind, geothermal and hydroelectric power. I think it is very important for Canada to invest in green energy every way it can.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479289">These are major concerns in my community. I represent a large, beautiful, rural riding where, sadly, too many members of my community are un-waged or under-waged. Many people living in my community who are in poverty are over retirement age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479290">Low-income women always outnumber low-income men in Canada. Two out of every three poor adults are women, yet women do two-thirds of the world's work, receive 10% of the world's income and own 1% of the means of production. This disparity is most egregious when we look at aging populations. According to the Conference Board of Canada, under the Conservative government, between 2006 and 2009, Canada saw an increase of 128,000 elderly people living in poverty. Among them, 70% were women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479291">The reality of senior women living in poverty is not an incidental or marginal issue. It is a major concern. Indeed, it is a crisis. This crisis will only increase as the baby boomer generation in Canada moves closer and closer to retirement. These are the people who will suffer the most if we do not invest in our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479292">There are upstream causes to older women living in poverty. In Canada almost half of all poor families are supported by a single woman whose average income is about 30% below the poverty line. There is no one reason why women are so much poorer than men, rather there are many and they are all systematic. Data from 12 industrialized nations found that formally employed women worked about 20% longer hours than men, yet women comprise the majority of the poorest in these countries. Most women are still responsible for the unpaid work of child rearing and taking care of sick people and elderly people. Poor women who are fortunate to have jobs are therefore stuck in low-paid part-time work because they must split their time between work and caring for their family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479293">The government must take action to promote job creation, good jobs, immediately in order to support these families. According to the publication entitled, “The Dollars and Sense of Solving Poverty”, released yesterday by National Council of Welfare, an independent body established to advise the federal government, there is a correlation between poverty and the lack of investing. The report shows that investing to reduce poverty actually benefits the entirety of our society. In fact, it would save Canada billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479294">I would particularly like to point out that the report finds that child and senior benefits provide secure, non-stigmatizing incomes broadly in society and that these have benefits well beyond individual recipients because the improved well-being of today's seniors enables them to remain active in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479295">Too many of the jobs created by the government are under-waged and part-time. It is a weak job market. That unemployment is at 7.3%, that full-time permanent family-supporting jobs remain extremely difficult to find and that ongoing uncertainty regarding Canadian retirement savings plans are factors that are increasingly threatening our economy. This is why New Democrats are proposing strategic investments to promote economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479296"> We need to take immediate action to ensure that all Canadians, especially those who are most vulnerable like those I have mentioned, women, elderly people, especially elderly women, and children, are taken care of and not left behind by a threatening recession. We need to ensure that all Canadians, especially these people, are protected in hard economic times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479297">This is why I urge all members of the House to support the motion. It is rather simple why we should support it. It is a reasonable way to help families in Canada.</ParaText>

For those who do not know how it works, a certain number of days are allocated to the opposition parties and they are able to bring forward motions on topics which they think are important regarding what the government is or is not doing. We are debating an opposition motion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479316"> I am interested that the NDP brought forward a motion regarding the economy. I have been in the House for five years now and it is hard to remember when the NDP wanted to talk about economics in the House of Commons. The mover of the motion, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation>, has been in the House for some time and I do not recall her mentioning economics, but she is now which, from our perspective, is the right thing to be doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479317">We have been talking about jobs, economic development and making sure that this country is able to withstand the economic turbulence that has affected not just Canada and the United States but countries all over the world. We see the very drastic changes that are happening in Europe. People have come to the conclusion that this is the priority. It has been the priority of this government for many years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479318">We have dealt with the economic shocks that have affected Canada over the last number of years. We brought forward a plan to maintain and increase jobs in Canada. That economic development and support has been helping Canadian families survive the very difficult recession over the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479319">I need to point out that before the recession, it was this government that took action on the debt. I should remind everybody what debt is. Debt is an obligation to future generations. It is money we have borrowed as a country which needs to be paid back. We cannot just not pay it back. We see the situation in Greece where debt issues are so extreme Greece is at risk of not being able to pay its debt. We cannot ignore debt. We cannot say it is someone else's problem or that we will deal with it on another day, in another Parliament, in another decade. We need to deal with it now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479320">We like to deal with facts. Our government paid down $38 billion of debt before the recession hit. This put our country in a much better position to deal with the issues facing our economy during the recession. It was a prudent way of positioning ourselves. We are a leader in the G7 in terms of being ready to put in place the difficult processes that are needed for us to handle any downturn in the economy. When there was a downturn in the economy and the recession hit, we had to put a plan together to make sure that we created jobs and continued economic growth here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479321">That is why we created Canada's economic action plan. It was not an overnight plan. It was not something we did one day and then forgot about it. It is taking a number of years to implement that plan to ensure growth, jobs and family security. It is not something we had for just a day, a month or a very short period of time. It is something we can build on as a country. We are doing better than our G7 partners coming out of the recession. All of the significant economic players around the world are congratulating Canada on its role. The economic action plan has played a significant role in the survival of our economy and the progress of our economy in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479322">That plan is still in action. We will be seeing part two of our economic action plan, another year of it. We passed a budget in this new Parliament. As we do every year, budget implementation requires two segments. We did one in June which implemented some parts of the budget. Next week there will be another budget implementation bill to implement the rest of the budget. There were so many good things in the budget passed in the spring we had to break it into two parts to make sure the proper legislation was in place to make. That will happen next week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479323">If the NDP and our Liberal friends are really serious about economic development, job creation and moving the economy forward, they will support the budget implementation bill next week to implement the second part of the budget. On May 2 voters certainly supported it by sending us back to the House of Commons with a majority government. They want us to implement it. Canadians asked us to make sure that we implemented our commitments on the economic action plan. We intend to do that. Based on today's motion I cannot see why the opposition parties would be opposed to implementing the second phase of our economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479324">In the past the NDP members have voted against many of our measures, maybe all of our measures. I cannot think of one measure they supported. I do not have a perfect memory, but I cannot remember any of the economic policies or legislation that we put forward to improve our economy being supported by the NDP. I am glad to see that today the NDP members are making the economy a priority in the first opposition day motion of this session. I am hopeful they will move away from their past non-support of these policies so we can continue to create jobs and come out of the recession in the best position of any industrialized country in the world. That is what the economic action plan will do. That is what it delivered in the past, and it is what it will do, if we are able to continue with the second phase, which we plan to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479325">Fortunately in the election on May 2 the Conservative government was returned with a majority, so we will be able to continue with that plan. Some people may say that it is not good enough. Opposition members have voted against everything we have been attempting to do. I do not know why it would not be good enough. There is always more to be done. However, we have created 600,000 new jobs and 80% of them are full-time jobs. The economic action plan is working and is moving this country forward. I am hoping there will be support for that next week when our budget implementation bill comes forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479327">Our role through the economic action plan is to make sure that economic development continues and that we support it, not through higher taxes as the opposition members are advocating today, and not from a bunch of bureaucratic processes that would slow things down. We made a commitment in the economic action plan to deliver on infrastructure for communities that were willing to move projects forward, to be able to spend some money and leverage that to create jobs in our communities. I will provide some examples of the success we have experienced this past week. </ParaText>

That new performing arts centre is about to open because the members of the community came together.

Being from the GTA, I have an interest in public transit, which was the subject the committee was studying.

It has also left a legacy of infrastructure that will service the cities and communities I am familiar with for many years to come. That infrastructure will allow people to transport themselves to and from work. It will make businesses more productive by allowing them to transport their goods and services more efficiently. By providing people with alternative forms of transportation, it will reduce the amount of vehicles on the road, which in turn will be better for the environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479333">Of course making those investments will affect the deficit. However, there was an agreement made with our G7 economic partners that a certain percentage of our GDP would be used as investments to help stimulate the economy. Based on what I have heard and have read regarding other countries, Canada has been the most successful in terms of leveraging that investment into jobs, economic growth and the stability we have needed throughout this recession. We managed to do that without increasing taxes.</ParaText>

It has made a significant difference in my riding. People remind me daily of the importance of this new savings tool which did not exist before we took office. For many years not much had changed to give Canadians an opportunity to save money. As is the case with taxed money, this money would not be further taxed in future. Canadians can invest it and use it for their own growth. The expenditures coming from these tax free savings accounts will bode well for our economy in the future. It also bodes well for those who are trying to save now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479339">We are encouraging people to save money. There has been much discussion in the media as well as in the House regarding personal debt levels. The Conservative government has devised a piece of legislation that will change the financial system in this country. As well, it is helpful with respect to promoting personal savings.</ParaText>

It is the right mix of legislation in terms of its ability to stimulate the economy as well as to help people invest in their own enterprises or their communities. We have been taking the appropriate approach. Canada has been recognized for that by many nations and many economic organizations around the world. However, there is no doubt that we still have more to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479342">What led us here in the first place is that we are proper stewards of the public coffers. We understood that debt was an issue and we needed to get our minds around that first. We must continue with the process we have in place. We have not completed the economic action plan process. It needs to continue. We are coming forth with legislation to do that.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the governor of the Bank of Canada, and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have spoken to Canadians about that. We must ensure that stabilizes because what happens in Europe will affect us in the end. It is hard to believe that what happens in Greece will affect people in Burlington, Ontario. If the European countries are unable to resolve their debt issues or pay their bills, Canadian companies will lose customers. We are a trading country. We need those customers to ensure a stable, progressive economy that will produce sales for our people, whether they be in Burlington or elsewhere across the country. I wish those European countries well. </ParaText>

It would take money away from those who create jobs, the entrepreneurs who understand supply and demand, and would give it to government, which I am not sure is the greatest steward of tax dollars.

It simply wants the Conservatives to give big businesses fewer tax breaks since there is no reason for them. Taxes, which are a progressive system for the equitable redistribution of wealth to all classes of society, are very positive since they make it possible to provide public services to all classes of society in a very fair manner. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479375">The government does a very good job of blowing smoke in mirrors. It totes around this notion that Canada's economy is not suffering and that we are not still experiencing the effects of the economic downturn, meanwhile ignoring the reality facing many Canadians and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479376">Many families in my constituency with whom I am speaking are still having trouble making ends meet. Not only that, but in order to make ends meet, many Canadians are forced to take on two, three or four part-time jobs. Why is this, one might ask? It is because far too many household supporting jobs have been lost and have disappeared. Canadians are being forced to turn to any form of employment that they can secure. These are usually more precarious forms of employment. I know that many of the constituents of Scarborough—Rouge River are burning the candle at both ends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479377">The current Canadian job market remains weaker than it was before the crisis in October 2008. Unemployment has risen to 7.3%. The proportion of part-time workers and involuntary part-time workers has also risen rapidly. Full-time, permanent, family supporting jobs remain very difficult to find in many areas across the country. The real unemployment rate, which, of course, includes labour force dropouts and involuntary part-time workers, was at 11.1% in July of this year, up from 9.4% in July 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479378">How the government can sit on that side of the House and argue that our economy is recovering fine and that Canadians are doing well is absolutely beyond me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479379">What is more is that this bleak job market and lack of real opportunity is even worse for Canada's youth. An article that was published in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> earlier this week outlined details from a recent study on Canada's problem with unemployed and under-employed university graduates. These are our best and brightest and yet, this week, when I asked a question in the House about this exact topic, the members opposite did not stand and talk about what they were doing to actually create more jobs and give more opportunity to the most educated in our country. Instead, they stood and spoke about tax credits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479380">What good is a tax credit if people cannot make enough money to pay any income taxes? This, unfortunately, is the bleak situation facing many of our youth today. They do not have jobs that pay enough for them to pay income taxes. What kind of life is that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479381"> In my riding of Scarborough—Rouge River, the number one issue that I hear at the doorstep of my constituents is jobs, jobs for our youth, jobs for our elderly, jobs. The riding of Scarborough—Rouge River does not have very much to offer in the way of jobs. Unfortunately, the reality for many of my constituents is that they must travel into the downtown core of Toronto for work. From our area, that is a minimum of about a two hour commute each way, which is a four hour commute in a day for many of my constituents. I used to do that myself. This means that people are spending four hours a day on public transport, which means four hours away from their families, an extra four hours a day that their kids must spend in day care or with other support, and four hours where we could be working at our second jobs to earn more income that we are not getting at our first job.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479382">What is worse is that many of my constituents do not work the regular 9 to 5. Many work shifts, overnight or into the wee hours of the morning, and then they must make that two hour trip back home on public transit which, at night time, can be even longer. This becomes an issue of public safety. When members of our families are waiting for buses on our street corners at all hours of the night, this is a huge concern, especially with the continuation of the proposed cuts to these services, especially transit in the greater Toronto area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479383">Many of the parents with whom I speak are very worried. They are worried about the welfare and the safety of their children. What messages are we sending to our youth when the only jobs available to them are part-time or shift work? What messages are we sending to our university graduates when, after spending years and thousands of dollars on earning a degree, they are forced into jobs that are greatly below their education standard. We know that our university grads are getting jobs at the low end of the income scale. What hope for tomorrow do we give these people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479384">This is another question I am often asked at the doorsteps of my constituency, unfortunately. My riding is one of the poorest in the GTA and yet many of the families who live in my area are spending their life savings or incurring extra and extreme amounts of debt to send their children to school to get that university degree or college diploma, only to have their children graduate and not be able to find jobs or only find severely underpaid jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479385">What financial risks now face those parents? What hope do they have for retirement? What is the quality of life for them in retirement when they spend all of their life savings on their children's education?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479386">I am also asked about the children and people who forego post-secondary education and enter directly into the workforce to help their families put food on the table. These youths are forced into part-time work, shift work and many times unsafe work, but there is no other option for them. They do this to put food on their families' table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479387">Many youth in my constituency cannot find work at all, which is very challenging for a community that has the largest youth to population ratio in the entire greater Toronto area. This is a huge problem for me and for the constituents of <Affiliation DbId="170390" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479388">What are we saying to these youths who are already marginalized because of their age, their ethnicity, their status in the country and their household income? What are we telling them? Are we telling them that they are not worth planning for? Many of the families in my riding with children and youth in this situation are very worried. I hear this on a weekly basis when I knock the doors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479389">The government likes to talk about being tough on crime. Why does it not deal with the real root causes of crime? Why not provide our youth with a sense of importance and value? Why not provide them with opportunities like jobs and access to post-secondary education? Why not give them hope and real opportunities?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479390">On this side of the House, we believe that our youth are the future of our great country and that, because of this, we need to provide for our youth. We need to inspire them to be involved. We need to give them the opportunities to be successful, not just set them up to fail, which is, unfortunately, what I am seeing from the other side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479391">Our youth, our university graduates and our college graduates need jobs. They need real jobs that will help them make ends meet, that will help them support their families and that will help them and their children lead better lives.

              <ParaText id="2479396">Mr. Speaker, that is a very poignant question. Our university and college graduates are not getting good jobs and the government is showing absolutely no leadership in investing in post-secondary education, as well as the follow-through with graduates. That is, unfortunately, that big piece is missing. Just as we invest in the settlement of new immigrants, we need to invest in the method by which graduates will travel through the labour force. That type of investment is not being seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479397">In speaking with university and college administrators, they would love that support from the government in order to invest in career and job development for their graduates. Unfortunately, the universities and colleges do not have that type of investment from the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479399">Looking at the government's economic proposals and in listening to members talk about what is happening in their communities, it is very clear to me that there is a need to redress the priorities. Instead of big tax breaks to banks and oil companies, which are making bigger profits than ever, it is time for us to invest in small businesses. How would investments in small businesses help drive the economy in Canada and keep jobs here?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479400">Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. Our small businesses are the engine behind our economy, especially behind the economic development of our communities. The government wants to give billions of dollars to large corporations that seem to be sending jobs away. It is giving money to corporations that are putting the money in their pockets but not hiring Canadians. They are mostly jobs that our university and college graduates would be able to do. It is the small and medium-sized businesses that are actually investing in and creating jobs in our local communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479401">The government is going in the wrong direction. It should not be giving away billions of dollars to companies that are taking jobs and money out of our country.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2479402">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak to this important motion from the opposition, which calls on the government to start taking some action, to pay attention to what is going on in the country and to begin taking some specific action as it relates to the unemployed, to businesses that are struggling and to innovation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479403">I will take a few minutes to talk about trade because it is extraordinarily important. It is important that the government enter into discussions around trade with its eyes open. My concern is that the government has set itself a quota of trade deals that it has to get. It is going after these trade deals and negotiating them simply to get through them so it can say that it has another trade deal and another notch on its belt. There are some problems with that I am going to get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479404">I want to talk about what we are hearing from the government benches. The government members stand and say what a great job they have done with the economic action plan. I was not here in the fall of 2008, but I watched from afar. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> came out after the election with an economic statement that said that everything was great, that we were gliding along perfectly, that people should not pay attention to all the economic turmoil beyond our borders, that everything was fine, that we would sail off into the next couple of years and that we did not need to do anything different. He said that there would not be any spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479405">It took a near-death experience for the government. The opposition members came together and said that Canadians recognized that the economy in our country and around the world was in terrible trouble. It was only until they decided they would join forces to bring the government down that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> suddenly woke up and said that maybe something was wrong, that maybe they had better do something quickly. They even went to the extraordinary length of proroguing the House in order to avoid the decision of Parliament and also to give time for the Minister of Finance to find himself and recognize that there was some trouble in the U.S. economy and throughout Europe with the economy and maybe he should do something about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479406">The Conservatives came up with the economic action plan, and they have been taking credit for that. However, we all know that it was only when members of the opposition threatened to bring the government down, did it recognize it needed to invest in infrastructure spending. Yes, countries around the world have recognized that Canada has done a good job in that respect. However, every time the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> stands, he almost breaks his arm as he tries to pat himself on the back and members opposite likewise applaud themselves. I cannot get over the level of hypocrisy coming from those member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479407">Given what happened three short years ago, it is incumbent upon the opposition to again try to jolt the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and his colleagues to recognize, as Canadians do, that there are serious problems out there. Members on this side talk about unemployment among youth. University graduates are building up greater student debt because of the lack of support from the federal government as is the case with the lack of support for provinces and universities. When they go out to try to prepare themselves for the work world and for the global economy, they find there are no jobs. There are no supports for innovation. There are no specific actions on behalf of the government to support our young people who are taking the time and incurring the debt to prepare themselves by increasing their training. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479408"> We have heard members on this side talk about innovation, about how the government needs to recognize the fact that it needs to support activities, ideas and those clusters of innovation that are developing in various parts of the country, to ensure those industries are in a position to not only create jobs, products and services that are innovative and world-class, but so they can then trade with the world. They need support so they can trade and exchange and build the economy of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479409">However, there is nothing. All we hear is the government saying that we may not have as many jobs as we had back in 2008, but we should not worry as Canada is doing better than the United States, Greece or Italy, so it is doing a great job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479410">The people of Dartmouth—Cole Harbour do not think that is good enough. The people who come to my office, the people who just got out of university and are looking for work, are asking me what the government doing. Seniors who cannot find care and support in homes are wondering why the government has turned its back on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479411">I had a meeting just the other day with a 72-year-old senior. He lives in Cole Harbour in subsidized housing in a seniors' complex. He lives on $14,000 a year. The members might remember the debate we had in June about the difficulties of seniors living on such low pensions and the fact that the government was failing those seniors. Here is a guy who has taken it upon himself to try to find a part-time job working as a crossing guard three hours a day, three days a week, protecting children as they cross the street in Cole Harbour. Every dollar he makes is being clawed back. We have a senior who cannot make ends meet because of the paltry pensions that are paid by the government. He is trying to make ends meet but the measures the government brings hold him down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479412">The reason why we have brought this resolution forward is to take the opportunity to remind the government that the action plan was not its idea. The government was forced into it. It was kicking and screaming at the reality of the fact that it needed to take action. I and members of the opposition are here to once again to say to the government that Canadians need it to act. Canadians need it to start making investments in its communities. Canadians need it not to turn its back on them, not to make phony polls or any of the rest of it on the government's website. They need the government to pay attention to the pain and struggles that people are experiencing in their communities. It needs to deal with the problems of infrastructure of the Champlain Bridge in Montreal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479413">Those are the realities. Those are the things the government needs to take action on to make a difference, so when the economy does turn around, Canada will be in a better position to move us forward and create the jobs that our young people need.</ParaText>

Low in greenhouse gas emissions, it can be used to heat homes and even supplement coal in generating electricity. </ParaText>

The economic action plan arising out of budget 2009, which was a very difficult time for the global economy, resulted in the growth of about 600,000 net new jobs in Canada, which is a record in the G7. Our performance job-wise is that it leads the G7. We have strong fiscal and economic fundamentals in Canada. I know the NDP wants to raise taxes, but we think that is the wrong way to go.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479694">Indeed, with the global economic recovery so fragile, as demonstrated by the ongoing events in Europe, keeping Canada's economy on the right track must remain our priority. While Canada's economy has created nearly 600,000 net new jobs since July 2009, the strongest job growth in the G7, too many Canadians are still looking for work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479695">That is why we are working hard to implement our prudent, low tax plan to support Canada's economic recovery and help create jobs through the next phase of Canada's economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479696">Indeed, our Conservative government remains focused on ensuring Canada continues to offer the right environment to attract investment necessary to create more and better paying jobs, thereby improving the living standards of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479697">Ironically, one of the most proven ways to that end is an action opposed by the NDP, to give job creators the means to hire more workers by lowering their taxes, which is exactly what our government is doing. It is also exactly what we have done since coming to office and what we told Canadians during the election that we would continue to do if we were returned to government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479698">Given the results of May 2, it is safe to say that Canadian families prefer our low tax plan over the tax and spend plan of the NDP. Families know that our Conservative government is acting on what matters to them as we steer them through this turbulent global economic period.</ParaText>

As the University of Alberta president, Indira Samarasekera, asserted, this investment supported “the goal of reaching the world, of promoting Canada's international brand”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479744">Unbelievable as it might seem, although no surprise, the NDP again voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479745">As I have already demonstrated, our government responded quickly to the global economic downturn with our economic action plan by taking decisive steps to protect incomes, create jobs, ease credit markets, and help workers and communities get back on their feet. Part of this plan was an investment to improve infrastructure in the communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479746">Now, with the next phase of the economic action plan, we are proposing targeted investments in infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479747">The plan includes working with the provinces, territories, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and other stakeholders on the development of a long-term plan for public infrastructure, and that is beyond the building Canada plan and legislating a permanent annual investment of $2 billion in the gas tax fund to provide predictable long-term infrastructure. Again, that was in the last budget. My municipalities are absolutely delighted with that secure investment into infrastructure. Providing up to $150 million to support the construction of an all-season road between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk that completes the Dempster Highway, connecting Canadians from coast to coast; and providing $228 million to fund repairs and major maintenance on federal bridges in the greater Montreal area to ensure that the bridges continue to serve the needs of the commuters while meeting the highest safety standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479748">A more local example was $4 million to build the new transit centre in Kamloops and over $900,000 to the Kamloops airport to improve safety features. Again, that is very important in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479749">The list just goes on. As the Federation of Canadian Municipalities stated, budget 2011 “makes it clear: strong communities--with quality infrastructure--are essential to a strong economic future”.</ParaText>

In fact, a good way to increase the number of jobs is through infrastructure and construction jobs. Sometimes investing in infrastructure programs will deliver more jobs than a corporate tax break.

In this regard, I read a study about inequality released this summer by the IMF. It indicated that the more equitable the distribution of income, the longer and the more stable the periods of economic growth. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="170671" Type="2">Mr. Guy Caron (Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2479784">Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to mention that I will share my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170154" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>. You will no doubt be happy to know that I will not be reading from a newspaper today, so I should not have any problems with this speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479785">I know that this debate has to do with the economy and job creation. I am going to assume that our colleagues on the government side are interested in creating jobs. We are as well. However, what we hear a lot from the government is rhetoric, slogans or mantras claiming that there is a direct correlation between tax cuts—particularly corporate tax cuts—and job creation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479786">Let us be clear. There are a number of ways to create jobs. There are a number of ways for the government to stimulate the economy and create jobs. Tax cuts may be one way, but there are also other ways, such as investing in infrastructure, redistributing wealth or making direct investments to benefit low-income households or the unemployed. All of these measures will have very different effects on economic recovery and economic stimulus. These are effects that can be assessed, and this has been done by the Department of Finance, so by a government department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479787">A few of these measures were evaluated based on their multiplying effect on the economy. For example, the Department of Finance determined that for each dollar of corporate tax cuts, approximately 30 extra cents would be added to the GDP. That is the least effective measure of the six evaluated by Revenue Canada. One of the most effective measures involves direct help for the poorest households or the unemployed; for each dollar invested this way, $1.70 is added to the GDP. In terms of infrastructure investments, $1.60 is added to the GDP for each dollar invested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479788">And for measures related to housing investments, $1.50 in economic growth is generated for each dollar invested. These measures have very different effects. Some are more successful and promising than others. Corporate tax cuts are the least promising and successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479789">This is easy to understand. Direct measures to help low-income families and the unemployed generate so much economic growth because the money is immediately invested in the economy. Households need this money to invest directly because they have no money to save. It is invested directly into the economy. Investing in infrastructure or housing is just as easy to understand. It creates direct jobs and allows private businesses to benefit from infrastructure to make the economy work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479790">These three measures have direct, positive impacts on the economy. When it comes to reducing income tax, the impact is extremely weak. Can corporate tax cuts help the economy? In certain cases, yes. Take, for example, a private business that does not have the cash needed to make investments. It wants to invest in the economy but does not have the money to do so. At that point, income tax and corporate tax cuts will generate the money it needs to be able to invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479791">However, that is not the current reality. The liquid assets the private sector currently has available, in dividends, investments or funds set aside, have increased, going from $157 billion in 2001 to $477 billion today. Let me be clear: Canadian companies are currently sitting on a mountain of $477 billion. That is money they could be investing. It is an increase of $320 billion in 10 years. Of that $320 billion, I would like to specify that roughly $120 billion comes, once again, from the Canadian public purse through the corporate tax cuts enacted by the previous Liberal and Conservative governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479792">What are the corporations doing with this $477 billion? They are not investing it right now. Why not? There are a number of reasons that we will not necessarily get into at this time, but the economic context is such that they have decided not to invest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479793">What impact will corporate tax cuts have on the Canadian private sector? They will not lead to more investment. If the profitable corporations are currently not investing, if they find the current context not suitable for investing the $477 billion they have today, not to mention the additional revenue they will earn, then they will see no additional reasons to invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479794">That is why corporate tax cuts are not the best approach in the current Canadian economic context. However, it is the only significant way the government has found, with what it calls the low tax agenda, to stimulate the Canadian economy. The Department of Finance has clearly stated that corporate tax cuts have no impact on job creation. The proof is in budget 2009, budget 2010, but not in budget 2011. We can presume that the government was too embarrassed to add those cuts in budget 2011. Budgets 2009 and 2010 clearly show that corporate tax cuts have no impact on job creation. I repeat: they have no impact on job creation. And the government has no proof that a single job has been created as a result of its corporate tax cut initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479795">What impact will this have on the Canadian treasury? We are talking about a loss of $4 billion to $6 billion this year. That is a loss of approximately $10 billion to the Canadian treasury over two years. That $10 billion was not invested; rather, it has helped to build the mountain of cash on which private companies are now sitting. In the past 10 years, we are talking about a net loss of $120 billion to the Canadian treasury. This money could have been invested in infrastructure rather than transferred to companies where it is not doing any good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479796">We are currently talking about an infrastructure deficit of approximately $100 billion. The hon. members for Quebec know that there are striking examples in Montreal. We need to invest to replace the Champlain Bridge. This summer, we saw the news about the Ville-Marie tunnel; this is symptomatic of the state of our infrastructure. This type of problem exists in the larger centres and in my riding of Rimouski—Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basque, where I spent the summer meeting with municipal councils. I have 39 municipalities in my riding and most of them need infrastructure, whether it be recreation centres, new municipal offices, road infrastructure or water systems. There are pressing needs. We are talking about $100 billion for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479797">According to Revenue Canada's figures, the money that is currently being given to companies so that they can add it to their mountain of cash—the money that is not being used for anything—could be invested in a more beneficial manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479798">Let us be clear. If companies want to invest, they can do so. They are currently in a position to invest but they choose not to do so. They are not going to choose to invest more and create jobs if they are given tax breaks such as the ones the federal government gave them in previous plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479799">According to the Department of Finance's figures, the NDP's program is much more effective in terms of stimulating the economy and creating jobs. We are talking about investing in infrastructure and providing direct support to low-income households and unemployed workers. These are measures that will help to increase employment. The direction that the Conservatives are taking and their failure to act are putting us in an increasingly perilous situation, as demonstrated by the warnings from financial firms, banks and the International Monetary Fund, among other things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479800">By adopting the NDP's plan, we would be going in the right direction; we would be creating employment and stimulating the economy. I would like to invite the government to go in this direction, specifically by voting in favour of the motion put forward by my colleague, the finance critic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479801">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a very clear question, and I hope our colleague can give us a clear answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479802">The NDP and our government clearly disagree when it comes to taxation. The NDP wants to raise taxes on Canadians, and we believe in lower taxes. This was demonstrated when our Conservative government reduced the GST twice, from 7% to 6%, and then again to 5%, thereby easing the tax burden on Canadian households.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479803">The NDP voted against lowering the GST both times. It is even proud of its position. This is what the current NDP finance critic had to say:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479806">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to answer this question because what she said is true. It is not just the NDP that has said so. Most serious Canadian economists have shown that if stimulus and economic recovery were the goal, lowering the GST was probably one of the least effective ways of achieving it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479807">The Conservatives should have lowered income taxes, but we did not have that debate. Cutting taxes would have been a much more effective recovery measure. Decreasing the GST from 7% to 5% reduced federal tax revenues. This contributed in great part to the fact that, between 2006 and 2011, we slipped into the red: the federal government went from a $13 billion surplus to a deficit even before the recession. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479808">Cutting the GST was probably the worst measure that this government could have adopted. It was a purely political move that did nothing to stimulate the economy or promote recovery.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479815">Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion presented this morning by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation>. I would like to thank her for her excellent work. I represent a riding which is a perfect example of the need for immediate action on the economy. The Conservatives say that they have a jobs plan and that it is working. That is just not true, and is nowhere more evident than in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479816">The riding was once the proud home to much of the Canadian manufacturing industry. As we have heard this week, Ontario has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the recent years. York South--Weston had: Canadian Cycle and Motor Company; Moffat stoves; McClary appliances; Massey-Harris; de Havilland; Fruehauf; Scott-Woods; Canadian Gypsum; MacMillan Bloedel Limited; A.P. Green; Dominion Bridge Company; Ferranti-Packard; Kodak Canada; Levis; Crosley Radio and Television; Schnier; Carl Austin; Acme Screw and Gear; Pepsi-Cola; and lots more. They are all gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479817"> Tens of thousands of good manufacturing jobs are now lost. Some companies went out of business, some went elsewhere in Canada and some began manufacturing in the U.S. or overseas to take advantage of cheaper labour. No one in the government did anything to try and stop them. Therefore, with all these jobs lost, what remains are service sector jobs at minimum wage or unemployment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479818">My riding has 25% higher unemployment than anywhere else in Toronto and Toronto's unemployment is already higher than the national average, currently at 8.9%. Cuts to Service Canada offices in such a needy area will make the difficult task of accessing employment insurance and other services provided by these offices even more so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479819">In addition, my riding is home to a population which is nearly 60% immigrant and over 10% of the people in my riding are not yet Canadian citizens. Immigrants have a much more difficult time finding work, as language and other barriers are more difficult to climb for them. Recent cuts to immigrant services by the Conservatives has had a devastating impact on settlement service agencies and other community agencies that assist these immigrant populations. Further cuts by the government would make an already intolerable situation much worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479820">The government frequently points to its record in infrastructure spending as having successfully reversed the recent recession. It is not so in York South—Weston.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479821">First, there was virtually no infrastructure spending in my riding. Most of the projects were for the city of Toronto to replace some water mains. The total spending was well under $5 million and well under the $50 million spent in <Affiliation DbId="170352" Type="2">Parry Sound—Muskoka</Affiliation>. We received perhaps 100 temporary jobs, no permanent infrastructure jobs. That did not make much of a dent in the 7,000 or so people who are currently unemployed in the riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479822">The spending spree is over but the problem persists. The unemployed in my riding sometimes are lucky enough to find jobs outside the riding. However, without investment and transit infrastructure, these folks spend as much as four hours each day commuting to work. Plans for a new light rapid transit system were recently shelved and the federal government did not offer any contribution toward its construction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479823"> Here is a great example of where the government could be creating local employment and helping the economy of Canada generally. I have long advocated the use of electric trains for regional rail services in Toronto. The government could both contribute to greenhouse gas reduction and economic development by providing infrastructure funding for electrification of rail services. The current plans for diesel trains, some of the money coming from the federal government, has neighbourhoods angry. Provincial leader Andrea Horwath of the NDP has made electrification of rail services a part of her strategy for carrying Ontario forward. She said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479828">These kids are part of a group that service agencies call “the Mike Harris generation”. They are the kids whose mothers and fathers were punished by the Conservative government in Ontario in 1995 with huge cuts to their support systems. These kids have learned that governments are the enemy, that governments punish them not help them. In desperation, some of these kids turn to criminal activities. The government's answer is to build jails. That way at least part of the social housing crisis would be taken care of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479829">What is wrong with Conservative economic policies is that they are not forward looking. Steady as she goes, doing the same thing we did last year allows other countries the opportunity to leapfrog over Canada in the race to be on the leading edge of economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479830">For example, we all know that carbon-based fuels are a finite resource. We are all concerned about air pollution and climate change caused by burning fossil fuels in ever-increasing quantities. We all know that creating and harvesting alternative sources of energy as well as becoming more energy efficient will be important activities for any country to move forward. However, the Conservatives will soon end the energy efficiency credits for homeowners yet they have done nothing to spur investment in green energy technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479831">There are huge demands for windmills and solar panels but most are built in other countries. We are not investing in Canadian-made electric trains for regional and long distance service. We should be leading the way. That requires decisive action by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479832">Many of my constituents are seniors living on fixed incomes. Their costs keep rising. They would love to make their homes more energy efficient. The jobs that might be created to do this work would be sorely welcomed in the riding. However, the uncertainty of the assistance available from the government makes this another temporary solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479833">I recently met with the president of Greensaver, a Toronto-based energy retrofit company that pioneered the idea of an energy audit to show where savings would be best in a home. It assembled a team of trained workers to install solar water heating systems but had to lay them off when the government assistance dried up. Companies need predictable long-term programs not makeshift temporary plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479834">The Conservative government has made quite a few comments about how raising taxes on big businesses would kill jobs. That is not true. We are not asking for a raise in taxes, just to reverse the tax breaks. Tax breaks given to large corporations by the Conservatives have gone directly to increase the profits of those already profitable corporations. They are not creating jobs. In turn, these excess profits are used to line the pockets of the directors and shareholders of these corporations. These tax breaks are not linked to job creation but to increasing profits.

              <ParaText id="2479840">I have a question for the member. Yesterday, the European Commission made a proposal to the 27 member states of the European Union concerning a new measure to tax financial transactions, which would mean that many common financial and banking transactions would be taxed. That is an idea that the NDP has traditionally supported. In fact, the NDP's industry critic and co-chair of the NDP caucus, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation>, once introduced a bill to tax financial transactions in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479843">I know the Conservative government members opposite do not like regulations and would like less government. However, we have a solid banking industry in this country. Part of the reason for that is all parties have resisted attempts by the banking industry to deregulate itself. When the banks wanted to merge we said no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479844">With regard to the NDP hating profits, that is not the case. We understand that corporations need to be profitable in order to survive. They need to be able to show a return to their investors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479845"> We are concerned that already profitable corporations are being given a handout by the government's reducing the amount of taxes they pay. What happens when the government reduces the taxes that are paid by already profitable corporations? It does not create jobs, as the minister has agreed. It increases their profits and decreases the amount of money available in the Canadian revenue stream, which then increases the pressure on the government to either reduce services to Canadian citizens or to raise personal taxes in order to compensate by an equivalent amount, billions of dollars.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479859">Throughout the country, growth is slowing down, jobs are being lost and there is record unemployment among youth. A government's main task is to ensure prosperity, not only for our country, but also for every Canadian. No one should be forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479860">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> believes his plan to rebuild our economy is very easy. It involves cutting corporate taxes and reducing the government's role. This means cuts and job losses, but the government should be focusing on preserving and creating jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479861">As the party that put the Canadian economy back on track on the heels of poor Conservative fiscal management, we know what it takes to deal with a debt crisis and a deficit. It takes fiscal discipline along with growth and healthy revenues. In other words, people need to be working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479862">How do the Conservatives respond to all of this? They cut corporate taxes and the government's role. If you are worried about losing your job, the government thinks it is your problem. If you have already lost your job and cannot find another one, the government thinks it is your fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479863">Unlike this government, the Liberals are focusing on policies that ensure prosperity, growth and jobs. We are here to say, as has been said in other eras when unemployment was high and times were tough, that it is the government's responsibility to work with companies, large or small, to increase business opportunities, give hope, and provide more opportunities for change and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479864">Canada's economic prosperity has always depended on strong international trade. Under the Conservative government, Canada is now seriously lagging behind on the international scene. A significant rise in job creation will not come without a serious effort focused on international trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479865">Canada's trade deficit with the rest of the world was $753 million in July 2011. That was our fifth consecutive month with a trade deficit. Since January 2009, Canada has only had nine months of trade surpluses, but 22 months of trade deficits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479866">The Conservatives' failure to act has led to a contraction of the Canadian economy at a time when we simply cannot afford it. Our real gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the second quarter. This latest decline in the GDP is a good indication of the ineffectiveness of the Conservative plan, which focuses too much on corporate handouts that are not reinvested, instead of focusing on Canadians and their needs, such as job creation, education, professional training and health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479867">Young people are especially affected by the government's failures and its inaction when it comes to the things that matter the most. Statistics on the high youth unemployment rate this summer prove that this government did nothing to create the jobs students needed precisely when they were trying to save money for the upcoming school year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479868">This summer, for instance, the average unemployment rate for students aged 15 to 24 was 17.2%, up from 16.9% in the summer of 2010. As a point of comparison, the unemployment rate in the summers from 2006 to 2008 was below 14%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479869">Another sector that suffered this summer was tourism, which this Conservative government consistently neglected. Worse still, this government even made decisions that were extremely detrimental to the tourism industry. We are already going through very tough economic times, and the Canadian industry cannot survive if this government brings in policies that undermine entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479870">From eliminating the GST visitor’s rebate, to hiking the air travellers’ security tax by 55% for foreign flights, to refusing to send a Canadian pavilion to Expo 2012, this government has done nothing but hurt Canada’s tourism Industry. Foreign tourism is a very lucrative source of revenue on which the various levels of government in Canada and hundreds of Canadian communities rely, and those communities deserve federal leadership to help bring tourists to our shores. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479871">But the Conservatives' attack on employment extends far beyond tourism and young people. Small businesses have also been completely ignored by the Conservative government. Small and medium-sized business owners and municipal leaders are absolutely shocked that Canada will not have a presence in South Korea for Expo 2012, when South Korea is such an important trade partner for Canada. Our 2010 Expo pavilion in Shanghai saw over 6.4 million visitors and facilitated 46 high-level business meetings that generated many agreements and partnerships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479872">The Conservatives prefer to ignore all that because making cuts is more important to them than maintaining and creating jobs. The lack of skilled workers, the need for more investment in infrastructure and the increasing burden of red tape are a constant source of frustration for small business owners. The only thing holding a number of them back from expanding is that they cannot find the skilled labour they need. What is more, after three years of promising to cut red tape, all this government has done is conduct another study. We need measures right now because Canadians need jobs right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479873">Since this government is more concerned with its ideological beliefs than the needs of Canadians, it is not surprising that the Conservatives have completely shirked their responsibilities in a number of recent developments with our trade partners, which could have an adverse effect on Canadian businesses and workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479874">The government was asleep at the switch when President Obama announced the provisions of his “Buy American” policy in his economic recovery plan earlier this month. It was taken by surprise even though, in two speeches before the bill was tabled, the President clearly indicated where his administration was headed. The so-called exemption for Canada in 2009 was clearly ignored in the $400 billion plan proposed by President Obama. The consequences for Canada will be serious and the Conservatives' incompetence in this matter is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479875">With the “Buy American” policy promoting the purchase of American products, country-of-origin labelling for agri-food products, and the Canada-U.S. tax treaty, Canadian interests have been systematically ignored by the Americans and the Conservative government has not done its job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479876">It is high time to focus on what is important: jobs. No miracle will save Canada from the troubling economic situation in which it finds itself. The government must invest in people, in our infrastructure, and in our capacity for research and development. The government must invest in helping needy Canadians rather than wasting taxpayers' money on punitive laws that will not make our streets safer and on fighter jets that Canadians do not need.</ParaText>

We should think back to those long six month and how things have changed. It is now almost October, and even if the economic action plan in that budget of February 2011 was the right thing to do at that time, although I do not accept that, but even if it were, the whole world has changed in the last six months. Therefore, what was right in February 2011, is not right today in late September 2011. We should think back to February of this year. What was happening? The stock market was going up nicely. Now it has tanked by close to 20%.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479911"> First, the IMF went into countries, forced them to cut spending and were really mean to the small countries, et cetera. It is fiscal conservative. What does the IMF say? The new head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, recently, in her opening speech to the annual meeting, said that what governments today should do is that they should have a medium term plan to balance the books and pay down debt, but, in the short run, they should take action to support jobs and the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479912">She is the head of the IMF. The government should do what she said. We certainly have the room. We should take action to support jobs and the economy in the short run, while having a plan to balance the books in the longer run. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479913">We also have Sherry Cooper, the chief economist at Bank of Montreal. I used to be the chief economist at the Royal Bank and the golden rule for chief economists is to never ever criticize the federal government or the boss will get mad. Maybe her boss is mad at her but she spoke truth to power and said what was right. She said that the actions of the government were like the actions of Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression. We do not raise taxes or cut spending when times are super tough. That is what Herbert Hoover did and it caused the Great Depression. That is what the government seems to be poised on doing, unless it follows the advice that it is receiving today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479914">I will talk about <I>The Economist</I>. Everybody would agree that <I>The Economist </I> is a small “c” conservative magazine. It is not raving socialist. It is fiscally very conservative most of the time. It understands that times are different, times are tough, times are extremely dangerous, so it has been urging for a number of weeks now the same thing as the head of the IMF and the same thing as Sherry Cooper. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479916">I would conclude that these are unusual times and they are dangerous times from an economic point of view. I am not saying that the government's plan back in February was appropriate but it can make a case that it was. However, even if it were appropriate in February, it is not appropriate in September. Additional actions need to be taken unless the government wants to be part of the mess rather than part of the solution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479931">Although my Conservative colleagues continue to boast about Canada's economic recovery, more and more I am hearing stories from members of my community of <Affiliation DbId="170117" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> that times remain tough and that high-quality, well-paying jobs just are not there in the numbers that they used to be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479932">Under the Conservative's stewardship of the economy, far too many of these family supporting jobs have been lost and Canadian households are increasingly feeling the squeeze of crippling household debt. Meanwhile, global economic instability and stagnation threatens already meagre economic growth in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479933">I will focus on the issue of Canada's infrastructure deficit and how strategic investment by the federal government can have a real impact on stimulating both short-term and long-term economic growth. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2479935"> In Laval, Quebec, in 2006, we saw first-hand what can happen when we allow infrastructure to deteriorate beyond the point of repair. Five people were killed, including a young child, when a highway overpass collapsed. Just last month, we also witnessed issues related to falling debris on a Montreal highway, leading to its closure and ultimately resulting in additional traffic congestion and additional delays for commuters and businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479936">Is the government prepared to wait until we see a major bridge collapse, like the one in Minnesota in 2007, to take action?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479937">This seems to be an extremely opportune time for the government to invest in a national infrastructure project. Interest rates remain at an historic low, making public infrastructure investment less expensive than it would have been in the past. Why is the government not undertaking such an initiative now while money is cheap and Canadians desperately need jobs? After all, the Department of Finance itself has noted that infrastructure investment has more than five times the economic impact of corporate income tax cuts. In fact, it published this fact in the appendix of budget 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479938">Why, then, is the Conservative government pursuing an economic avenue that neglects infrastructure and focuses, instead, on giving corporate handouts to Bay Street executives in the form of corporate tax cuts? Why not strategically focus on infrastructure investment, something that would produce jobs in all regions of the country immediately?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479939"> I am also very curious as to how the Conservatives propose strategic review will affect employees in the public sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479940">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170117" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, the Canada Revenue Agency is a major presence and is truly one of the vital employers in our region.

              <ParaText id="2479942">I have similarly grave concerns over staffing levels at the Sudbury Service Canada office, which is another important employer in the riding that provides vital services to the members of my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479943">I, therefore, urge the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to immediately reconsider all actions that reduce the public sector contribution to the economy.

This is because the real value of the Canadian pension plan--the CPP, as most of us call it--is not keeping up with the cost of living, and many individuals who have invested in other pensions are seeing their value slip away as pension funds lose money in stock markets or try to change payout rules to shift the risk onto their shoulders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479945">People who have paid into the CPP and have saved up for their retirement for all of their working lives are now finding that the rules of the game were always secretly stacked against them. The only way to ensure that all Canadians are adequately supported in their retirement is a phased-in increase in the CPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479946">Previously, the Conservatives indicated that they may be open to this option, but they have since turned their backs on this proposal. Despite the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>'s refusal to seriously consider this option, the proposal has a large amount of support, including support from a previous chief actuary of the CPP. Moreover, the CEO of the CPP Investment Board has said that the administrative costs of increasing the CPP would be lower than the private plan the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479947">We must now act to ensure that Canadian seniors are able to live without financial hardship. We cannot simply close our eyes to the issue, because it will only get worse as the next generation of Canadians begins to retire, increasing the percentage of Canadians receiving CPP.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2479970">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me to speak in the House to support the motion from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation>. This motion is particularly important in this economic context, which is so difficult, dangerous and worrying for Canadians. Our fellow Canadians are overburdened with debt and are stuck in low-paying, precarious jobs that have limited prospects for the future. Unlike the rosy world this government repeatedly talks about, the reality is far different for most people. Prospects for the future are bleak for all of us. Here are some powerful examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479971">The Conference Board of Canada says that the gap between the rich and the poor in this country has been widening for the past 15 years. And it is widening at a faster pace than it did in the United States over the same period, which threatens the fundamental Canadian values of justice and equality in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479972">In addition, Charles Sirois, chair of the CIBC board, and Stephen Jarislowsky, a major Montreal investor, are worried about how dependent the Canadian economy is on the development and export of our natural resources. These two men, who have decades of expertise in global economic issues, believe that our economy—with its lack of diversity—cannot handle the challenges we face from emerging countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479973">In the wake of major American investor Warren Buffett's statement, highly respected businessman Jean Coutu also expressed his belief that there is a completely incomprehensible fiscal imbalance and, as a result, he pays too little in taxes as compared to the Canadian public. He is therefore calling on the government to make the tax system fairer and more equitable so that he can do his part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479974">Contrary to this government, the NDP is advocating an economic approach that has worked for a long time. For a long time, the state has had a key economic role to play; to deny this is to turn a blind eye to the truth. Historically, we can see that periods that were the most economically successful in the long term achieved that success through major state intervention. When the state sets a strong and clear common goal of development, with rules of good governance and fairness on the markets, growth is impressive and sustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479975">The thirty glorious years provide an excellent example of economic measures to adopt when the economy is going downhill. Let us remember that, during that period, taxpayers' dollars were used to rebuild Europe, develop infrastructure, strengthen companies in North America and implement universal social programs that, for a long time, guaranteed a solid education system, health benefits that were accessible to everyone and the opportunity for most to retire with dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479976">All this is threatened by the economic approach of this government, which is irrationally obsessed with its weight, to the detriment of overall economic health. To paraphrase the great economist John Kenneth Galbraith, if it were only money at stake, we would not necessarily have much to worry about, but the plight of the millions of people who will suffer as a result of the action taken by this government is a matter of very great concern. It must be the main focus of our concern. In other words, we see that there are two conflicting visions of the economy in this House: that of the government, where finance takes precedence over the individual, and that of the NDP, where the individual is the centre of the economy. This could boil down to a simple ideological debate but, even then, the inescapable reality supports the NDP's approach. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2479977">First of all, one of the founding fathers of economics, Adam Smith, after making a harsh observation about the reality of his time, condemned that reality by advocating a moral approach to economic issues, an approach that took human needs into account. But unfortunately, Adam Smith was taken hostage by a simplistic economic vision endorsed by the Chicago school, which underhandedly did away with Mr. Smith's conclusions, maintaining only the observation and establishing it as dogma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479978">This sectarian approach has been very costly for many countries, especially in Latin America. Consider the example of Argentina, which went through a many lean years after applying measures similar to those proposed by this government. In addition, many Conservative governments in Canada have gone down paths similar to the one this government is taking, with disappointing and sometimes even disastrous results. To refresh everyone's memories, consider the following examples: the budgetary and economic trials and tribulations of the Diefenbaker government led to his defeat in 1962, when the public deficit had ballooned after a series of tax cuts—what a surprise—and after the value of the Canadian dollar dropped considerably compared to the American dollar; the Mulroney government ended a nine-year reign with an abysmal deficit of $42 billion as the ugly result; some 20 years ago, the Grant Devine government in Saskatchewan left the province's finances in ruins. After that, an NDP government led by Roy Romanow took over and in the early 1990s, despite the burden it inherited, it accomplished the amazing feat of achieving the first balanced budget of any government in Canada, whether provincial or federal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479979">The damage to the Conservatives' reputation at that time and later was so great that they had to reinvent themselves under another name, the Saskatchewan Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479980">But the best example is the Ontario government of Mike Harris, which dismantled social programs and Ontario Hydro to the ongoing and costly detriment of the province's taxpayers. If we heed the debates raging in the current Ontario election campaign, the Harris legacy is still strong. The question is: do we want that kind of legacy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479981">In another part of the world, in Denmark, where a social democratic government was recently elected after 10 years of a depressing coalition of the right obsessed with austerity and border security, the new left-leaning prime minister is going to invest more than $3 billion in her country's small, rich and egalitarian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479982">Despite the fact that it has few natural resources, and personal income taxes of up to 60% as well as a 25% sales tax, Denmark's per capita GDP is comparable to that of Canada. What is even more interesting is that employment rates for all age brackets are invariably higher in Denmark than in Canada. Denmark invests heavily in education, research and development, and in its workforce, whereas Canada relies too heavily on the abundance of its natural resources as justification for a laissez-faire attitude that puts us at the mercy of economic ups and downs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479983">According to the Conference Board of Canada, the government must adopt an economic approach that concentrates on specialization, that is the processing of goods, in order to control a larger portion of what is called the distribution chain. In short, our country exports too many raw resources for processing abroad. We recently came to an astounding realization: employment in manufacturing, which was previously significant, is rapidly decreasing. This realization only reinforces the NDP position: Canada's competitiveness requires the diversification of activities and strategic support for sectors that create employment in order to ensure that the Canadian economy is not governed solely by the “invisible hand” of the market. </ParaText>

The larger the gap gets, the more we see the middle class disappear. It is a problem that is only going to get worse.

However, the NDP actually voted against that reduction. Not only did it vote against it, but it said it was proud of the fact that it stood against it.

              <ParaText id="2479995">Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to take part in this debate today. I have been listening to a lot of it this afternoon and it has been quite an interesting discussion between two sides of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479996">In defence of my colleagues in the NDP, it was interesting to hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="170090" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> saying that the NDP had changed its position and had come to his side. In fact, the NDP has consistently held its view, but the Liberals have completely changed their position. The member for Markham—Unionville used to be in favour of lowering taxes as a way to stimulate jobs and create investments. Therefore, I think we should say that the NDP has been consistent and the Liberals have changed. The NDP may not be consistently right, in my point of view, but it has been consistent and I appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479997">As we all know, this is a time of global economic turbulence. We are following the markets every day and, certainly in Europe, nations are in severe trouble because of their debt situations. There are countries like Greece that have taken on unsustainable levels of debt and are having a very difficult time dealing with it. We see the situation in the United States, which has not experienced the level of job creation that we have here in Canada, unfortunately, and it is obviously causing some real hardship for the world economy as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479998">We understand that, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> understands that, and so does the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is why the finance minister has been very active with his counterparts across the globe in terms of finance ministers and central bank governors. He and the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney, were recently in Washington for IMF, World Bank and OECD meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2479999">It has been necessary to respond to this global challenging time, especially to the global recession in 2008-09. There was a concerted response from OECD countries from the G20 both in terms of monetary policy and fiscal stimulus. That is certainly one reason why we argue that the situation here in Canada has been relatively better than the situation in most industrialized countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480000">To look at promoting job growth and job creation, which is what this motion talks about, we argue that we have a very strong record in that sense. We have created approximately 600,000 jobs. I should not say “we”. The private sector has created 600,000 jobs since July 2009. In fact, if we look at the past year, there has been extraordinary job creation growth, especially in terms of full-time employment. There has been some very good numbers in terms of job creation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480001">The member opposite was saying that it is not the government that creates jobs. However, it is the government that puts in place the policies that enable job creation to occur. It was the government, in November 2007, that introduced a long-term plan to reduce taxes for small and medium-sized businesses that enabled job creation to go forward. Actually, it was pressing in terms of timing because it enabled some measures to take place before we were hit by the fiscal crisis in 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480002">We are very much focused on the economy. We are very much focused on growth. We are also focused on the prudent management of taxpayers' dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480003"> It is interesting to hear the opposition talk about being in a period of austerity now; we were in a period of stimulus and now we are in a period of austerity. I would encourage them to reread the budget that was passed in June of this year. There are increases in this budget: 6% per annum to 2014 and beyond for health care; 3% per year for education and social assistance; research and development, which was praised by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada; clean energy research; and things like neurological research. There are some strategic investments going forward and there are many other measures that I will touch upon as well, especially with respect to small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480004">We understand that small businesses generate a lot of the growth in this country. We understand that they are the primary employers of people in this country and that is exactly why we have put in place certain policies. I would like to emphasize these policies, such as: reducing the small business tax rate from 12% to 11%; and raising the amount of business income eligible for that rate from $300,000 to $400,000 to $500,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480005"> We did that for small businesses to enable them to create more jobs. It enables them to keep more of their own revenues and to invest more for themselves, their business and their employees. As small businesses grow, they will also benefit from the reduction in the general corporate income tax rate, which will be 15% in 2012.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480006">There has been a lot of talk in the chamber about how these tax reductions only benefit certain types of companies, and we hear banks and oil companies mentioned all the time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480007">It is important to note that if a business has an income above $500,000, that business will pay the higher federal corporate tax rate right now of 16.5%. A business with an income of $600,000 is not a massive enterprise in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480008">People need to understand it is not just about reducing tax rates for certain industries, whether it is oil and gas or the financial sector; it is about reducing it for every single business in this country that has business income above that $500,000 rate. I would hope all members would recognize that that includes a lot of small- and medium-size enterprises that we all admit are the primary generators of jobs in this country. That needs to be recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480009">In terms of lowering business taxes, as I mentioned, the economic update in the fall of 2007, which basically laid out this five year plan for reducing taxes, was to ensure that we were competitive on a global basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480010"> I would encourage members to go to the OECD website and look at the general corporate tax rates of certain countries. Countries like Chile, Sweden, and the Netherlands, countries that we are competing with, have tax rates very similar to ours. If we combine our federal tax rate of 16.5% generally with a provincial rate of about 10%, that totals 26.5%. We hope it will be 25% combined in January 2012. This makes us very competitive with a lot of these countries. Members should go to the OECD site to see where Canada fits in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480011">A lot of people across the aisle will say that the Americans have higher taxes on businesses than we do. Yes, they do, but in our view that is the wrong approach. They have a lot more loopholes and they have a higher overall tax rate. What we are doing as a government is lowering the overall rate but aggressively going after some of the loopholes, which I think some members on the other side of the aisle do support. If we want more jobs, if we want higher wages, if we want this business tax advantage, then we have to follow this approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480012">I did refer to the OECD in terms of where we fit in, but I would like to quote the OECD. It recently declared that Canada's corporate income tax reductions “should lower the cost of capital and buttress investment intentions. These advances...drive productivity gains and enhance employment prospects.” The fact is that the OECD has recognized what Canada has done and continues to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480013"> I would like to return to what I was saying about what was in the budget that we passed in June. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480014">The first thing I would like to talk about is the hiring credit for small business. It is a hiring credit of up to $1,000 against an employer's increase in 2011 for EI premiums over those paid in 2010. This is a very important point. I suspect frankly that there are members on the other side of the House who support this initiative. It was brought forward by some very responsible groups, like the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, in terms of what we can do to assist these small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480015">This temporary hiring credit for small business will be available to approximately 525,000 employers whose total EI premiums were at or below $10,000 in 2010, which will reduce their 2011 payroll costs by about $165 million. This is very important. I would challenge members on the other side to indicate whether or not they support this initiative, and if not, why not. If they do support it, then they should consider supporting the economic action plan that we are putting forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480016">We have also taken a lot of action in terms of small business through business financing programs. I would like to highlight some of those initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480017">The Canada small business financing program supports about $1 billion in loans to approximately 7,500 small businesses each year to either help them get started or to expand. Our government increased the maximum loan amount under this program from $250,000 to $500,000, of which up to $350,000 can be used for equipment and leasehold improvements. This is part of our economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480018">This is important as well, because one of the main points small businesses will make is the challenge they face in terms of access and capital. They have raised it with all of us as their members of Parliament. They will often go to a financial institution and have a tough time either accessing capital or accessing it at a cost they can afford in order to expand their business or hire more people. This obviously helps those small businesses address that problem directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480019">We are doing more especially for small- and medium-size businesses. We are cutting red tape.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480020">As of 2009, we have eliminated almost 80,000 red tape requirements for small- and medium-size businesses. To build on that, earlier this year we launched the Red Tape Reduction Commission to find even more ways to reduce the burden of federal regulatory requirements on Canadian enterprises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480021"> In the next phase of the economic action plan, we have also included a number of additional initiatives, including support to make our BizPaL initiative permanent. This initiative enables businesses to go online to complete all their requirements. This online service significantly reduces the red tape burden on small business owners by allowing them to quickly and efficiently access the necessary permits and licences from all levels of government to operate their specific businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480022">Finally in this area, we committed that the Canada Revenue Agency will consult with the business community and key stakeholders to identify opportunities to further improve its services and reduce the administrative burden while respecting the overall integrity of the tax system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480023">With all of these initiatives recognizing the importance of small business within the Canadian economy, it is no wonder that the president of the CFIB, Catherine Swift, has said:</ParaText>

Another example is we provided the Canadian Youth Business Foundation with support, giving young entrepreneurs access to business loans and mentoring services as they start up and operate new businesses. That mentoring aspect is very important. There is an initiative in Alberta called Productivity Alberta which is about people with a lot of experience, particularly in the manufacturing sector, mentoring some younger people in the manufacturing sector. That mentoring of the next generation of business leaders is as important as or even more important than access to financing.</ParaText>

First, the working while on claim measure will allow EI claimants to earn additional money while receiving income support. This will be renewed until August 2012.

              <ParaText id="2480033">There obviously is a number of initiatives that are designed to help especially people in some very challenging areas. We have certain regions which are experiencing very high economic activity and certain regions which are not. We are very cognizant of that fact and we are responding to it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480034">As an aside, at some of the round tables I have been doing with some of the small businesses in my area, when I ask what the greatest challenge is, many will say that their biggest challenge is access to people, finding enough people who will work in their enterprises. It goes across all sizes of business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480035">There was an individual in my office recently. He is my age. He is a very young CEO. He said that he could hire 75 people for his service business today, but he simply could not find them. Perry at the Denham Inn in Leduc said that he needs about six people. He put out the notice, received replies from 38 people who had an interest, but all 38 people turned him down. He looked at me and asked what he should do because he needs people. This is one of our challenges going forward. Even as we have a relatively high unemployment rate, there are going to be businesses that increasingly find it a challenge to find people, whether it is skilled or unskilled labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480036"> I also want to highlight the initiative that dealt with rural physicians. It was in the budget and it was mentioned in the last election campaign as well. Starting in 2012-13, practising family physicians will be eligible for federal Canada student loan forgiveness of up to $8,000 per year to a maximum of $40,000. Nurse practitioners and nurses will be eligible for federal Canada student loan forgiveness of up to $4,000 per year to a maximum of $20,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480037">By getting doctors and nurses into our rural communities, and my riding certainly has a rural part, we are helping all Canadians access essential health care services no matter where they live in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480038">Another aspect of our program that I would like to highlight is the whole trading agenda. It is interesting. An economist from a bank was talking about the response to the Great Depression, Herbert Hoover and all of this. I find it quite farcical, frankly. If we look at what the response was in the 1930s, it was one of raising tariffs, shutting down trade, and raising taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480039">What our government has been doing, especially two budgets ago, is eliminating tariffs. We are now eliminating tariffs especially as inputs for the manufacturing sector. The other thing we are doing is embarking on a very aggressive trade agenda. We realize that we have to diversify our trade. We are obviously very closely linked to the United States, with 85% or so of our trade linked to the United States. We need to expand and diversify our markets. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did his southern tour this summer, to really work on those markets to expand and diversify our trade opportunities. Countries like Colombia and Brazil are prime opportunities for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480040">It is interesting, even when asking companies in my riding how they are doing on their exports, a lot of them will say that in terms of their U.S. exports, they are down about 25% or 30%, but their exports to Brazil have taken almost all of that up. If we focus on diversifying trade, we are obviously going to be helping many of these companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480041">I want to talk about our response on the innovation side. Again, I would return to the rhetoric.

              <ParaText id="2480042">One of the areas we are investing in is research and development and innovation.

This measure was introduced a number of years ago to assist people who were moving from social assistance into the workforce. When they do that, they often lose an awful lot of benefits. When they get into the workforce and start working, they find it harder to make ends meet because they have an awful lot more expenses. The working income tax benefit is designed to help people at that level so, as they move up, they can move up much more quickly and they do not face that real hardship at the point where they move from social assistance to the workforce.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480060">He raises a valid question. I would point out, though, that the PBO combined both provincial and federal debt. In fact, if we read the report carefully, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is much more critical of provinces in general, and specific provinces. We are having an election in Ontario. I am not supposed to delve into this, but I think he is quite critical of the provincial Liberal government in Ontario with respect to what it is doing with its finances. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480079">Madam Speaker, I would like to speak today about the increasingly obvious issue of poverty as well as the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country. I agree with my colleagues, who are outraged at this government's lack of action. It is not taking concrete measures to deal with an alarming economic situation that is affecting Canada and all of its communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480080">I think it is time for the government to take its head out of the sand. While it brags to potential foreign investors and the media about how strong and safe our economy is in these tumultuous times, it needs to understand that Canadians are not stupid and they know how fragile the country's economy really is. Numerous recent reports paint a very different picture of the reality all Canadians will have to face, if they have not faced it already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480081">A recent Conference Board report says that the gap between the rich and poor in Canada is widening, even more than in the United States. What is worse, Canada had the fourth largest increase in that gap among the 17 most industrialized countries. Obviously this is an unacceptable situation and urgent measures must be taken to strengthen the country's economic policy and provide more fair and equal distribution for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480082">In light of this, it is quite understandable that Canadians wonder why the government is choosing to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480083">When a country is going through difficult times that could jeopardize its economic health, every second counts. Although other countries around the world seem to be experiencing even greater difficulties than we are, globalization means that our economy is very dependent on events beyond our borders. Therefore, the government must make a commitment to the voters and implement appropriate and equitable initiatives that will protect our economy, create jobs and ensure a well-deserved retirement for our seniors and a prosperous future for our youth. The government must be accountable for its actions and ensure the economic protection of the people. The solution to poverty is to be proactive and not passively implement reactive measures that come too late and are often inadequate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480084">In the National Council of Welfare's fall 2011 report, the chairperson indicates that readers will see a disturbing picture of poverty in Canada. He also confirms that the toll of poverty on the Canadian economy is too high, and I share that sentiment. To back up what I am saying, here are a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480085"> In 2007, the public cost of poverty, that is, government expenditures—and we have not even mentioned the private cost of poverty—totalled $24.4 billion. This figure is twice the poverty gap, which is the amount of money required to bring all Canadians out of poverty. Can Canadians afford to carry this fiscal burden when studies prove that investments in well-being are more profitable in the long term? The answer is no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480086">The annual cost of housing an offender in a prison cell is up to 10 times greater than the cost of supervised housing. We know very well that thousands of prisoners are incarcerated for minor crimes, that they have mental health issues, and that they do not receive adequate care for their conditions because of a lack of resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480087">Twenty per cent of health care costs are directly related to socio-economic gaps. If the population that is in a precarious financial situation was not in that position, it would be healthier and more able to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480088">At this point in time, the Canadian economy is losing between $3.5 billion and $5 billion dollars a year because the skills and experience of immigrant workers are not recognized. These are just a few examples of what poverty costs all Canadians every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480089">Other troubling figures also confirm the concerns of Canadians, including the people of my riding who have trusted me to represent them. While poverty among families and seniors is becoming a major source of concern, which the government must pay more attention to, the unemployment rate among young people, even though they are healthy and well qualified, continues to rise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480090">If the government still believes that Canada's economy will survive the global economic turmoil, why is Canada's labour market so stagnant? Why are Canadian families finding it harder and harder to make ends meet and why are they being forced to drastically lower their standard of living in order to survive?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480091">At this time, we all know that the labour market is weaker than it was even before the financial crisis in 2008. Canada has recorded a net job loss for the first time since last March. In question period, the government boasts about the fact that it has created 600,000 net jobs. We cannot help but wonder about the beginning and end dates of that job creation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480092">According to Statistics Canada, in August 2011 employment was little changed for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate edged up slightly to 7.3%. In the past 12 months, employment has grown by 1.3% and 223,000 jobs were created, primarily in Ontario and Alberta, and in the private sector. That is nowhere near 600,000 jobs. Where do those 600,000 net jobs come from, the ones several ministers, including the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, keep talking about in question period?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480096">The overall debt of the average Canadian family has now reached a record level—previously established at 150%. Families with two parents working full-time who used to be middle class are now on the low end of the income scale. Canadian families are suffocating and in debt. They do not have enough money and they do not have time to work more because they are already working as many hours as they can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480097">The unemployment rate among students reached 17.2% this summer, an increase of over 3% as compared to the rate before the 2008 recession. Students represent the workforce of the future; if they manage to graduate, they are the ones who will be actively participating in our collective growth by paying taxes. Without jobs, the cost of living is too high for students to be able to make ends meet, which leads them to drop out of school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480098">Is this the dark and difficult future that the government wants to offer these people? It seems clear to me that the government is completely out of touch with the everyday lives of voters and is not taking their situations into account when it implements strict measures and makes drastic budget cuts. Just when Canadians need the government—when they need support and resources to get their heads above water—the government is letting them down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480099">The numbers speak for themselves. If the government is bragging about keeping the Canadian economy healthy, it needs to redo its calculations. There are good economic strategies and there are optimal strategies. There is a huge difference between spending and investing and the government must recognize that once and for all. Why does the government not see spending to combat poverty as an investment in society?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480100">Maximizing our collective wealth potential depends on full employment. That is why the government must act now to develop a clear and optimal national strategy that will attack poverty directly at the source of the problem rather than adopting strategies that only treat the symptoms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480101">If Canada is trying to help people survive poverty, I will admit that we are having some success. However, what the government is doing now has significant social costs. If, on the other hand, we want to work together to eliminate poverty and its costly effects, we must adopt a different approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480102">What the NDP is proposing in its motion is a true investment strategy in order to optimize Canadian resources, a strategy whose benefits will be seen and felt in the long term. This is a strategy that puts more emphasis on preventing poverty than on spending once the harm has already been done.</ParaText>

However, according to the business community and the individuals I have talked to, there are parts of the country where there are simply no skilled people to fill the jobs there. I heard this in rural Canada and I heard it today at a skilled trades councils conference. What they are looking for from the government is a job creation program. That is what is missing. It is not in the motion. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2480119">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480120">Just this week economists before the finance committee commented on the situation that Canada faces during this current economic turmoil. They were nearly unanimous in their view that due to the lack of investment by the business community combined with Canadians' personal debt burden neither would be likely to stimulate our economy in this time of need. We were told there are some $500 billion that corporations are holding onto. In fairness to corporations, when we consider the experience they had in the recent lending crunch in the last recession it is quite understandable that they would want to protect their cash assets not knowing what the next months and years might bring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480121">The economists were united in stating that it was time for the government to take up the slack in our economy and invest in our infrastructure. Today in Canada there is a 7.3% unemployment rate. New Democrats believe that it is closer to 11% when we include the people in society who have given up and lost hope. Really we are saying that one in ten Canadians is not working or contributing to our economy and, in many cases, he or she is sadly nosediving into poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480122">Last week the Social Planning &amp; Research Council of Hamilton released a report about seniors poverty. As members will know, in the last session I was the critic for seniors and pensions, but the member for <Affiliation DbId="170153" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> has taken over the seniors part of it. This report was very striking. It reported that 7.5% of seniors in Hamilton live in poverty and the rate of poverty among senior women is double that of senior men.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480123">During the last session, I stood in this place month after month calling for the government to dramatically increase the guaranteed income supplement to deal with this untenable situation of seniors poverty. The government responded and in its budget gave them $50 a month as an increase to the guaranteed income supplement. That is a pittance. We need to understand that seniors are living on about $15,200 a year. The poverty line is above $22,000 a year. When I say that $50 is a pittance, I am glad we no longer hear it being trumpeted in the House because it was very troubling to hear that day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480124">New Democrats know what is needed. The government needs to stop talking about its record and stop trumpeting its recent electoral victory. Conservatives are the government of the day. It is a victory that cannot be used to once again justify putting on the blinders when it comes to dealing with the needs of Canadians across our country who are facing a crisis. Conservatives continually repeat in this place that they have a clear majority. A clear majority of 61% of Canadians did not vote for the Conservatives or their agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480125">We need spending that is targeted to: real job creators; the $130 billion deficit in our infrastructure, as identified by the Canadian Federation of Municipalities; construction and the repair of roads and bridges, like the bridge in Montreal; and, public transit. Discussions are taking place regarding a Quebec to Chicago high-speed rail link. There are examples of things that we could be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480126">We also need to target the training and retraining of Canada's workforce. When I was a school board trustee in Hamilton there was a dropout rate of about 28%. In so doing, those people were isolating themselves from being part of the economy. We all understand the need for education and retraining. In my community of roughly 500,000 there are over 112,000 people living in poverty. We need to find a way to bridge the gap between these people and work. Over the next five to eight years employers are going to be crying out for skilled workers. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480127">One of the presenters at our committee today was from a community college. That individual talked about the gap that is going to be there even with our new immigration policy. The gap figure that we will not be able to fill was 30% I believe. Yet, we have people living in poverty who have the capacity to work, if we can find a way to bridge them to that work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480128">I want to quote Glen Hodgson, the chief economist for the Conference Board of Canada, who was one of the presenters at committee. He said, “We believe that we're severely under-invested as a country in infrastructure. We haven't got the numbers, but others have, engineers have, the federation of municipalities has, and I think their number of going back five years was a deficit of about $130 billion in terms of infrastructure investment”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480129">He further commented, “This tells me there is huge scope for realigning government spending priorities and making sure we're making adequate investments in roads, in ports, in bridges to ensure that--”, and I am paraphrasing, he said economies like that of Montreal function well. If we lost the bridge in Montreal, what would that do to the economy of that community and the economy of our country? It cannot be allowed to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480130">There are other things that he went on to talk about, such as social infrastructure. Again, he was commenting on the facing of an aging population. We would like to see more Canadians working, and he stressed more women and aboriginals working. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480131">There are programs such as childcare that we could put in place to allow more women to go back to work and improve our labour force participation and make sure companies have the workers they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480132">Another presenter at committee was Marc Lavoie. He is a professor with the department of economics at the University of Ottawa. To paraphrase, he said that the Canadian government already in his opinion should abandon this goal of balancing the budget that has been set for 2014-15. It should give up its budget cuts already announced. It must establish a new stimulus package on infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480133">We need to put what is being proposed into perspective. The government is proposing to cut services in this country that Canadians need. It is proposing to take some of the workers who work for the government in various programs and put them on the street. We should find a way to move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480134">I know we have great debates in this place over taxes. I keep hearing commentary from the other side stating that the NDP wants to raise taxes. The corporate tax rate in this country in 2000 was 38% and the American rate was 36%. The finance minister to the previous prime minister lowered the Canadian tax rate to 20%, right in the middle of the G20. It was a more than reasonable move, but it took billions of dollars out of the economy, billions of dollars out of this place that we could have used to help Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480135">What did the present Conservative government do? It took that corporate tax rate of 20%, which was already well below the American 36% rate, and dropped it to 15%. It is on its way to 15%. That takes $16 billion a year out of the government's ability to do things for Canadians in this time of crisis. We had a report of a $12 billion deficit a year ago. Is it not interesting how that matched up very closely with the changes that the government had made? This was a planned deficit that was put in place by the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480136">I recall a minister of education in the government of Ontario talking about causing a crisis in education so the government could address it. We have a government here that has not caused the economic crisis, but it is not responding to it properly. It is exacerbating the crisis and making it much worse than it needs to be.</ParaText>

Many commit minor offences. That is their way of pushing back at society. The only way to fight that is to give them reasons to remain in school.

Going forward, I think the government should develop a green economic and job strategy to create a more environmentally sustainable economy.</ParaText>

We had the opportunity as a Canadian group of politicians to be a leader in the world and that was defeated, as I recall, in the Senate.

People could start off at a lower level in construction trades by refitting homes and learn the skills necessary to progress in a trade so that project, which we estimated at $2 billion, over time would have created a situation where homes were properly protected from the environment, heating and cooling loss, and all of those things, and at the same time train people and supply some hope for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480148">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak to this very important topic. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the opposition motion on pension and retirement income issues. As we know, our government's top priority remains jobs and the economy. Certainly, this is a priority for many retirees and retirement savers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480149">Today, I would like to speak to what our Conservative government has accomplished in the area of retirement income security. However, before getting into the details, I will touch on what our government has done for the overall economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480150">In 2008 Canada was faced with the worst global recession since the 1930s. Our government acted quickly and decisively. Through Canada's economic action plan, we delivered extraordinary support for jobs and growth during a turbulent global economic period, and it worked. With the creation of almost 600,000 net new jobs since July 2009, Canada has more than recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession. It has posted the strongest employment growth among the G7 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480151">Canada has also maintained the best fiscal position among the G7 with the lowest net debt and among the lowest deficits in the G7 as well. Even better, the IMF and the OECD both project Canada to be among the strongest in growth in the G7 and, for the fourth straight year, the World Economic Forum rated our banking system the world's best. Undoubtedly, Canada has an enviable position relative to our G7 counterparts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480152">Along with our strong fiscal position, solid financial system, and our low tax approach to encourage investment, we are helping to ensure that Canada is well positioned to address any challenge ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480153">As prosperity ties into savings and ultimately retirement, I will move from the topic of overall economy and back to pensions. In so doing, let me begin by saying that our government shares the deep-rooted concerns of many Canadians about their retirement security. We understand the importance of a secure and dignified retirement, especially after a lifetime spent building a better Canada through hard work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480154">For that reason we have been aggressively working and focusing on improving our retirement income system. Indeed, we have already taken major action to strengthen Canada's retirement income system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480155">What have we done? First, in recognition of their life-long contributions to the country and our government's core belief that Canadians should keep more of their hard-earned tax money, we dramatically lowered the federal tax bill for seniors and pensioners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480156">Since forming government in 2006, our enviable record includes more than $2.3 billion in annual targeted tax relief such as increasing the age credit amount by $2,000; doubling the amount the of income eligibility for pension income credit; and increasing the age limit for maturing pensions and registered retirement savings plans to 71. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480157">We have introduced the tax free savings account, particularly beneficial to seniors as it helps them meet their ongoing savings needs on a tax efficient basis after they are no longer able to contribute to an RRSP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480158">Jonathan Chevreau, a noted financial commentator, has declared, “TFSA is also a welcome tax shelter for Canadian seniors”. On pension income splitting for 2007 and subsequent taxation years, Jamie Golombek, a financial commentator, has noted that, “Pension splitting is probably one of the biggest tax changes in decades, in terms of the amount of tax savings this can mean for pensioners”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480159">Furthermore, our record also includes important improvements to several specific retirement income supports. We have dramatically increased the amount working seniors can earn before facing a clawback under their guaranteed income supplement, GIS, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480160">We have enhanced the guaranteed income supplement, GIS, for those seniors who rely almost exclusively on their old age security and GIS, and may therefore be at risk of experiencing financial difficulties. This measure will provide a new top-up benefit of up to $600 annually for single seniors and $840 for couples. This measure will improve the financial security of more than 680,000 seniors across Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480161">Finally, we increased flexibility for seniors and older workers with federally regulated pension assets that are held in life income funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480162">Second, we took major steps to reform the legislative and regulatory framework respecting federally regulated private pension plans. Indeed, these steps represented the most significant reforms in nearly 25 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480163">Announced in October 2009 after extensive cross-county and online public consultations held in the months beforehand, the reforms include enhancing protections for plan members, allowing sponsors to better manage their funding obligations, making it easier for participants to negotiate changes to their pension arrangements, improving the framework for defined contribution and negotiated contribution plans, and modernizing the investment rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480164">These key reforms are warmly applauded across Canada. A diverse and broad group of public interest groups ranging through the National Association of Federal Retirees; the Association of Canadian Pension Management; the Canadian Institute of Actuaries; CARP, Canada's association for the 50-plus; the Common Front for Retirement Security; the Bell Pensioners Group; the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association; and even the Canadian Labour Congress welcomed and expressed their pleasure with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480165">A <I>Globe and Mail</I> editorial heralded the reforms as a good step. John Manley, a former Liberal Party of Canada member of Parliament, finance minister and deputy prime minister of Canada, declared them significant reforms that will enhance protection for plan members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480166">However, those reforms to federally regulated private pension plans were only one step in a much larger process. This leads to the third and final area of our focus on improving retirement security and pensions in Canada, wherein we are working with our provincial and territorial partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480167">While many Canadians may not realize it, the vast majority of pension plans, approximately 90% in Canada, are provincially regulated. In other words, the federal government only has the constitutional authority to make laws related to the private pension plans of federally regulated employers, such as airlines, chartered banks and others, which employ fewer one than one in ten of all workers in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480168">That is why, to address larger pan-Canadian concerns about pensions, we have been examining the relevant issues with our provincial and territorial counterparts in a co-operative and constructive manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480169">We have demonstrated this by establishing a joint research working group on retirement income adequacy and by holding numerous federal-provincial-territorial summits on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480170">We also fundamentally believe that the Canadian public had a fundamental right to be involved in and at the centre of this debate. That is why we have ensured that Canadians from coast to coast to coast have had the opportunity to have their voices heard in person and online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480171">From March to May 2010, we invited public input through round table discussions, expert conferences, online consultations and public town hall meetings to gather feedback directly from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480172">Even labour organizations like CUPE, typically not supporters of our government, were forced to begrudgingly admit we had conducted a serious public policy discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480173">Following these extensive and necessary consultations, the findings strongly suggested we explore opportunities to build further on the strength of Canada's retirement income system. As a result, we agreed, along with the provincial and territorial governments, to explore a set of innovative improvements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480174">Indeed, it is one of those innovative improvements I would like to talk about for the remainder of my speech: pooled registered pension plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480175">These pooled registered pension plans, PRPPs, available to employers, employees and the self-employed, will provide Canadians with a new low-cost accessible vehicle to meet their retirement objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480176">Once implemented, PRPPs will play a critical role in improving the retirement options available to Canadians, providing a low retirement savings option. Indeed, PRPPs will be a new savings option for the millions of Canadians who have never had a private pension before.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2480177">As Rob Brown, a former professor at the University of Waterloo and past president of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries recently stated, “Pooled Retirement Pension Plans could be a big step towards the redesigning the retirement income security systems required for Canadians for the 21st century. Pooled Retirement Pension Plans are a good idea; one clearly worthy of pursuing. Furthermore, PRPPs will be especially important to small businesses and their employees who will now have access to a low-cost private pension plan for the very first time. As many small business employees and employers will pool their pensions, a lower management cost will be achieved, meaning many new savers and Canadians will be buying retirement savings in bulk”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480185">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House again today to give more clarification on the question that I asked in this House on June 21. This question involves the Atlantic groundfish licence retirement program, which in fact is a rationalization program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480186">I would be one of the members in this House who has pushed harder for rationalization in the fishery than probably anybody else in this House. It is so important, and it is so important for the government to carry through after the rationalization program is put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480187"> The rationalization program is able to take licences and people out of the fishery who need to come out of the fishery because of the stock issue. What it does is allow people to retire and to pay bills and live a decent life. It also leaves the people in the fishery who wish to make a living in the fishery with an opportunity to make a proper living, so rationalization is indeed a very important issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480188">With regard to the groundfish issue, 2,300 fishermen applied for this program. However, 752 fishermen had to take the government to court in 2006 in order to be dealt with fairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480189">The court made its decision a few weeks ago. It indicated that Canada Revenue Agency had to review the files again, which in fact meant that the government must settle with the fishermen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480190">The only thing that I want to make sure of and to stress to the parliamentary secretary and to the government is that the government must settle in an appropriate manner. We have to ensure that everybody in the fishery is treated fairly. There have been some payments made. We have to make sure that the payments that have been made will be the same as the payments that will be made very shortly when they deal with those fishermen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480191">There are approximately another 1,400 fishermen out there who were not involved in this court case, and these fishermen deserve fair treatment from the government. These 1,400 fishermen worked hard to make a living and worked with the 2,300 fishermen to put a rationalization or, as they call it, an Atlantic groundfish licence retirement program in place. All that I ask the government to do is ensure that it settles with the 750 fishermen in the same way that it settled in the previous settlement and that the 1,400 fishermen who have not been dealt with fairly are dealt with fairly. In the future, when we put a rationalization in place and the licence for the fishermen belongs to the Government of Canada, we must remember that the fishermen invest a lot of dollars--their lives, in fact--into the fishery. When it becomes impossible to make a living and the government has issued the licence, it is the responsibility of the Government of Canada to pay these fishermen a decent payout so that they are able to retire in a decent way and so that the stocks will survive without this type of program right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480192">In the area that I represent, the lobster fishery is very important. There has been a small rationalization program put in place, but more dollars are needed for these types of rationalization or payment programs. The government must commit to paying the people who have been involved previously properly. I do not mean the 750 who went to court and fought the battle and won; there are now 1,400 fishermen who need to be treated properly without going--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480195">Madam Speaker, I must first say that the Canada Revenue Agency must safeguard the confidential information it receives according to the confidentiality provisions of the Income Tax Act. Therefore, we cannot comment on any specific cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480196">Since the inception of the Atlantic groundfish licence retirement program, the matter before us today has received considerable attention by the CRA. The application of the Income Tax Act to these types of payments is a matter of some complexity and disputes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480197">In general, when a taxpayer disagrees with an assessment, the act provides objections and appeal rights that must be exercised in the manner and within the time frame specified in the act. If a taxpayer fails to exercise his or her objection or appeal right, he or she may choose to request consideration under the taxpayer relief provisions, which are also contained in the Income Tax Act. The court also provide Canadians with an independent review of disputed issues and serves to clarify the law or resolve differences of opinions with the CRA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480198">The matter considered by the Federal Court was whether the fishers, who had not disputed the tax treatment of the compensation amounts through the objection and appeal process, could benefit from the same tax treatment accorded to the other fishers who had disputed CRA's position. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480199">On May 16, 2011, the Federal Court directed the CRA to reconsider these fishers' requests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480200">As the minister informed the House on June 21, 2011, “the government will not appeal this decision, and CRA will now reconsider the fishers' claim as requested by the Federal Court”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480201">The CRA has now reconsidered the fishers' requests and concluded that exceptional circumstances exist to allow a re-examination of the income tax returns of the 752 affected fishers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480202">The CRA will now review the fishers' income tax returns for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 tax years on a case-by-case basis and this will start October 2011. The CRA will notify each fisher of its decision in due time.</ParaText>

On September 13, Statistics Canada reported that household credit market debt rose to 149% of disposable income in the second quarter. At the same time, due to falling share prices and pension assets, average household net worth fell by 0.3%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480213">Canadians are feeling squeezed in every direction. As savings disappear, credit becomes both more important to families and more dangerous, both to individuals and to the economy as a whole. Because of this we need comprehensive legislation designed to protect Canadians from the predatory practices of credit card companies and some banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480214">Far too many Canadians sign up for credit cards with low introductory rates, only to see their rates soar once the period ends. Too many students and low-income Canadians are aggressively pursued by credit card issuers and end up taking on debt that they are realistically unable to repay. Far too many Canadians are charged excessive fees and penalties for paying their balance a few days late or a few dollars short.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480215">It is not only consumers who are being gouged by credit card companies and some of the banks. On the first anniversary of the government's voluntary code of conduct, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business published a report card on the voluntary code. Its findings were that small-business margins were being eroded by credit card merchant fees. In fact, the Competition Bureau has already ruled that Visa and MasterCard's “honour-all-cards rule”, which forces small businesses to accept higher cost premium cards, is anti-competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480216">It is time for the government to act to protect consumers, to protect small businesses and to protect the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480217">Just this Tuesday, the finance committee heard from a senior private sector economist who pointed out the precarious situation of our economy. Douglas Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said that there was a 35% chance of Canada entering a recession in the next year. We need to ensure that the government acts now to ensure that consumers are protected in case the worst happens. The government's wait and see approach is fundamentally flawed. It is better to treat the cause now than to apply a band-aid once it is too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480218">In April 2009 the 40th Parliament adopted my motion for the government to introduce comprehensive credit card legislation to protect consumers. The problems facing the global economy may be different today, but this issue continues to affect Canadian consumers and small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480219">When will the government recognize this and make the legislative changes required to continue to protect consumers and small businesses?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480220">Madam Speaker, in response to my colleague, who is a fellow motorcycle enthusiast, I take issue with the fact that my colleague's party voted against a number of measures that our government has put forward to address this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480221">The Conservative government is clearly committed to helping protect Canadian consumers especially with regard to financial products like credit cards. We have demonstrated that through the numerous landmark actions we have taken in recent years to protect consumers. Again, these are actions that the NDP voted against.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480222">We believe Canadians should not need a magnifying glass and a dictionary to read their credit card statements or applications. We also believe that they should not have to be lawyers or economists to understand them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480223">That is why our Conservative government has forced greater clarity and more timely disclosure from credit card issuers when dealing with consumers. It has put into place actions such as the new landmark rules that ensure Canadian consumers now have fair and transparent information and rules for credit cards with new regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480224">I will cite some of those rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480225">Summary boxes on contracts and applications will help improve disclosure to consumers by clearly stating key features such as interest rates and fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480226">There are clearer implications of minimum payments by improving consumer awareness of the time it would take to fully repay loans if only the minimum payment is made each month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480227">Timely advanced disclosure of interest rate changes will protect consumers from sudden and poorly disclosed interest rate hikes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480228">There is a minimum 21 day grace period. All new purchases made within that period shall remain interest free if the consumer pays his or her balance in full by the due date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480229">There are lower interest costs with mandatory allocations of favoured consumer payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480230">There is express consent for credit limit increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480231">There are limits on debt collection practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480232">There is the prohibition of over-the-limit fees by restricting fees caused by merchant holds placed on credit cards thereby protecting consumers from inadvertent fees for which they are not responsible nor aware of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480233">These are rules that the Conservative government worked on. Unfortunately, once again the NDP voted against them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480234">When Canadians make the choice to use a credit card they are not signing away all of their rights. Our new consumer-friendly rules will empower Canadians by making it easier for them to shop around for the credit card best suited to their needs without fearing that they might be taken advantage of later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480235">Indeed these new regulations were well received by Canadians and consumer groups. In the words of the Consumers Association of Canada, “All of the things that the finance minister has done are actually just what we asked for overall. I've got to congratulate him”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480236">It boggles my mind to understand why the member stands today to pretend he supports these measures when he and his party in fact voted against them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480237"> However, our Conservative government knows there is always more it can do to protect consumers. We have already acted in that respect. Indeed we have recently announced measures to prohibit negative option billing and reduce cheque holding periods while providing timelier access to funds. Unfortunately, the NDP voted against those too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480238">Why will the member not do the right thing by supporting the consumer protection measures we have taken and forget this nonsense about being committed? He should be standing in the House and voting for these measures to protect consumers when we put them forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480239">Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague and I are avid motorcyclists. Perhaps we should go for a ride and have this conversation because we are obviously not seeing the same side of this consumer debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480240">When we were bringing this issue forward we applauded the Conservative government for what it had brought forward on some of the issues relating to it. Having bigger fonts on a credit card bill though does not help people at the end of the month. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480241">We are calling for stricter guidelines and regulations with regard to credit card companies and banks to ensure that at the end of the month the consumers who have used their cards actually understand what their bills are about. The bigger font helps in doing that. For example, if someone has a $1,000 credit card limit and he or she makes a payment of $800 on that card, that person is not expecting to pay interest on the portion of the debt that was paid off. However, what credit card companies are doing is stating in the fine print of the credit card contract that interest is to be paid on the full amount. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2480245"> The member is not understanding what it is he voted against. He ought to have voted for it because it sounds as though he wants to better protect consumers, which is exactly what this Conservative government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2480246">In fact in the next phase of Canada's economic action plan, we are taking even more action to protect consumers of financial sector products. In particular, we are further enhancing consumer protection by banning unsolicited credit card cheques and also developing measures to enhance the consumer protection framework related to prepaid cards. These are positive measures that are well received.</ParaText>
