              <ParaText id="2960143">Mr. Speaker, the early 1940s were dark days in England and in the rest of the free world. People were desperate for some good news and a feeling that freedom was fighting back against tyranny and oppression. Bomber Command became a ray of hope as the only way that the allies could take the fight to Nazi Germany. Canada's contributions were impressive and the stuff of legend, but the success of Bomber Command came at a terrible cost. Out of 125,000 aircrew who served, over 55,000 were killed, including over 10,000 Canadians. This is a debt that can never be repaid but it is a debt that can never be forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2960144"> In an act of political correctness in 1945, Bomber Command was left off the list of organizations that were officially recognized for the role it played in the allied victory. This oversight is finally being corrected 67 years later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2960145">The new Bomber Command memorial will be unveiled in London on June 28 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the presence of 42 Canadian Bomber Command veterans. The Bomber Command memorial will form a physical and emotional link to our past. We will remember its members' dedication to the values of freedom and democracy and we will remember their sacrifice. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.</ParaText>

There is still no national strategy for transit, air or rail. He has failed to heed the advice of the Transportation Safety Board on air safety. There are still no voice recorders and automatic braking systems to reduce train accidents. He has failed to protect pedestrians and cyclists by making side guards mandatory on trucks. He also has failed to protect rail customers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2960148">What did the Minister of Transport get done? He is following a grand Conservative tradition of appointing insider friends.

              <ParaText id="2960151">The term “dominion” was originated by Sir Leonard Tilley who came up with it “as a way to encapsulate the aspirations of the Confederation generation”. It was derived from Psalm 72:8 and was meant to denote the breadth of the country from “sea to sea”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2960152">Dominion Day was taken away from Canadians when late on a Friday afternoon, in a voice vote, 13 MPs enacted legislation doing away with Dominion Day, with no debate, no thought, no warning and no reflection. They attempted to expunge from our history a word which, as Senator Ann Bell said, “...has a connotation of a firm foundation and an assurance of growth. It takes us above and beyond rather small partisan political concepts of the country”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2960153">I do not support the elimination of Canada Day but July 1 also needs to be known as Dominion Day once again. It is a mistake to try and preserve the future by destroying the past and the name Dominion Day should be restored.</ParaText>

I think it is only fitting that we take this moment to recognize just how well we are served and the fact that we sometimes do take it for granted. I thank them very much.</ParaText>
