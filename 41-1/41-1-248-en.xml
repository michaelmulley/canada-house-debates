            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3318070">Mr. Speaker, let us speak of kings and queens and crowns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318071">At the culmination of the Glorious Revolution in 1689, the British Parliament allowed William III and Mary II to ascend to the throne, but there was a catch: they would need to accept the convention of the right and the Bill of Rights, which established Parliament as the ruling power of Britain. It would become the mother of all parliaments, including our own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318072">While an imperfect document, some of the principles of the Bill of Rights live on to this day. One of them would later be described as no taxation without representation or, in the words of the Bill of Rights itself, that “levying money for or to the use of the Crown...without grant of Parliament...is illegal”. Simply put, the Crown can only spend the people's money with their consent, and only Parliament can grant that consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318073">Three hundred and twenty-four years later, the principle is the same. Government cannot spend what Parliament has not approved, which brings us to the Crown, or crown corporations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318074">Under present rules, they may enter into a room with a union leader, negotiate an agreement and send the bill to taxpayers, who do not have a say but must pay. The people's servants in Parliament do not vote on it, nor does the elected government sign off, so in this respect it is as though we have returned to the mid-17th century, when the Crown levied money without grant of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318075">What has resulted? Let us consider Canada Post. Its losses and liabilities are the burden of its owners. They are taxpayers. Seventy-one per cent of the company's costs are labour wages and benefits. To find out why, let us look at the latest collective agreement, a 500-page monstrosity. For example, if there is no work for a Canada Post employee to do within a 40-kilometre radius of where he or she is located, the union agreement prevents that person from transferring to another place where his or her skills are needed. The worker must stay at home and remain without work even while on salary. In other words, when there is nothing to do, taxpayers pay for nothing to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318076">The union requires taxpayers to fund almost 500 corporate post offices, even though they are three times as expensive as retail outlets that provide the same service and are open for longer hours. After bankable sick days, pre-retirement leave, seven weeks of vacation and more, the amount of time the carriers spend delivering mail is only a portion of the time for which they are paid to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318077">None of this done, by the way, in the workers' interests; their jobs, after all, are only secure when the company is successful. What is more, ambitious, talented employees are forbidden from any kind of bonus, performance or otherwise, by their union. God forbid that excellence be rewarded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318078">The financial results speak for themselves. Last month's Conference Board report on Canada Post indicated “annual operating deficits of close to $1 billion by 2020”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318079">On top of that, the company will have billions more in accumulated pension liabilities. Who will pay for that? It will be taxpayers, of course. They never authorized it and they cannot hold to account the unelected officials who did. Politicians can claim innocence, for it was an arm's-length body that did it. Sure, the arms had enough length to reach into the pockets of taxpayers, but never mind; these crown corporations are independent. Actually, they are dependent on the same taxpayers they are independent from. In fact, we are told their very independence depends on their right to be dependent on the people they are independent from. Simply put, they are independently dependent.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318080"> I suppose it depends on one's point of view. In the view of opposition parties, today's crown corporations are similar to the crown on King James II's head. He was the last king of England prior to the Bill of Rights. He could tax as he wished and spend as he liked. He too was independently dependent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318081">However, every crown has its king. Union leaders have coronated themselves the monarchs of Canada's state-owned corporations. They have legislated monopolies on the workforce. Do as they say, or they will shut the place down with a strike. They collect mandatory union dues from workers, even those who choose not to be members—talk about taxation without representation. Employees who do want to work and build a merit-driven company are out of luck. They are banned from representing themselves in negotiations or from signing their own employment agreements. These vast union powers would make James II blush with envy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318082">While the budget will not solve all of these problems, division 17 of part 3 of the bill amends the Financial Administration Act to empower the democratically elected government to reject labour agreements that abuse taxpayers. In other words, we are restoring the principle of no taxation without representation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318083">We here in this chamber are that representation. The colour of this chamber is green, because in the early day of the House of commoners, the commoners came from the fields, and it was their toil in those fields that paid the levies the Crown expended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318084">It is the duty, therefore, of the government to have the approval of Parliament for all that it spends. This bill does precisely that. In this sense, it restores Parliament as defender of the public purse and makes the Crown servant and not master.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318087">The government is telling us that it has nothing to do with the closure of post offices because Canada Post is an independent corporation.

              <ParaText id="3318095">Mr. Speaker, the Conservative member began his speech with talk of kings, queens and crowns. My speech will focus on mere mortals—ordinary Newfoundlanders and Labradoreans and Canadians—the people the Conservatives have forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318096">I had a public meeting in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170371" Type="2">St. John's South—Mount Pearl</Affiliation> just this past Sunday. At the start of the meeting, a 65-year-old woman approached me. She pulled me aside to speak privately about a problem. She is a single woman who rents an apartment, and the company that owns the apartment just raised her rent by $45 every two weeks. That is $90 a month. That is $1,080 a year. The problem is that she is retired and has a small pension, a fixed income, and she has no idea how to pay for the increase in her rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318097">What is in the bill, the economic action plan 2013 act, this economic inaction plan 2013 act, for that senior in my riding? There is nothing. There is no help whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318098">The lady asked me not to forget her. She asked me to do something about housing and to do something for seniors, for people on fixed incomes and for low-income earners. They are having a harder and harder time getting by. I am doing that right now. I will do it at every opportunity and every chance I get to speak about the Conservative economic inaction plan, 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318099">What is in this budget for low-income earners to help keep a roof over their heads? Nothing. The Conservatives voted down a recent New Democratic bill for a national housing strategy to fix Canada's housing crisis. What does the government do? What does their budget do? The Conservatives went a step further than just voting down the NDP plan for a housing strategy. Starting next year, they will cut homelessness funding by $15 million a year. This budget does nothing for that senior in my riding, and seniors are suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318100">There was a story in the news back home in the last few days about an 82-year-old man from the Cornerbrook area of western Newfoundland. He was charged with theft for stealing food from a grocery store. The police say that this type of incident is rare, but a seniors' advocate says that this is only the beginning. The advocate I mentioned said in the news story that “more seniors will start to resort to petty crime, as many cannot afford to eat by the Canada Food Guide”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318101">Eat by Canada's Food Guide? They cannot afford to pay rent. They cannot afford to turn on the heat in their own homes. That is what this country has come to. That is what the Conservatives have done to our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318102">What does this budget do for Newfoundland and Labrador? Of all the things in this budget, what resonates most back home? What have people been talking about? They are talking about how the price of hospital parking is going to increase, about how the poor and the sick, the most vulnerable in our society, will have to feed even more money they do not have into parking meters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318103">The Conservatives can cut taxes to big business. They can give industry breaks, but who pays? It is the sick and the poor. That is who pays under the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318104">What is in this budget for Labrador specifically? It is the status quo, more of the same: dirt roads, poor Internet service. Who knows what goes on behind the scenes? When Peter Penashue was our representative in the federal cabinet, he pitted The Big Land against the island. Penashue actually boasted about his divisive politics, which is the worst kind of politics.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318105">Penashue admitted to holding up infrastructure projects on the island in an attempt to move forward projects in Labrador. This is the type of politicking that goes on behind the scenes with the Conservatives, but they are also in our faces with it. This is the third omnibus bill. It includes 49 pieces of legislation from increased user fees for hospital parking to cuts to health care and damaging cuts to credit unions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318106">Most Canadians will not realize the ramifications of this budget because it is so big with 49 pieces of legislation and because there is so little time to debate it. It denies MPs the ability to thoroughly study the bill and its implications. New Democrats would like to send so much of this omnibus bill to various House of Commons committees so we can bring in experts and analyze the true implications. However, the Conservatives deny us that opportunity and that right because they do not want the scrutiny. They do not want Canadians to know what is happening to Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318107">The Conservatives are trying to tell Canadians that there is nothing to see in this bill. In a way that is true. There is nothing for job creation, to make life more affordable or to strengthen the services that families rely on. There is little in this budget for youth. Youth unemployment stands at more than 14%. Although the Conservatives have just announced another 5,000 paid internships in this budget, that is a drop in the bucket compared to the need. We do not hear the Conservatives speaking about the $14,000 a year those internships will pay. That is not enough for students to pay their student loans or participate in the economy. It is not enough to live on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318108">There is not a word in the budget about student debt. The average student debt in this country stands at $28,000 per student. How can students participate in the economy the Conservatives like to trumpet as their success, when they begin their working lives with no work and a $28,000 anchor around their necks? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318109">Let us move on to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I worked for almost twenty years as a journalist, twelve years as a daily newspaper reporter, five years as an editor-in-chief, a columnist, and another two years as an open-line radio host. Most of those years were with private media outlets. I personally know the kinds of pressures that can be exerted on newspapers or news outlets to run or not to run a story.

              <ParaText id="3318125">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170277" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> spoke here a few minutes ago about respect: his respect in this place and his respect for Canadians. However, I was troubled because that is the same member who voted repeatedly to shut down debate in this House, and shut down people's opportunity to learn about the various bills and legislation, more times than any other government in the history of our country or of this Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318126">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170277" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> also talked about defending the public purse.

              <ParaText id="3318127">Mr. Speaker, I do not have a clue where that $3 billion has gone, but I think taxpayers have the same question. We all have the same question. However, the problem is that there is no answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318128">The hon. member mentioned the speech from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170277" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> across the way. I have to say, when that member began his speech, and I mentioned this off the top of my speech, he spoke about kings and queens and crowns. I was sitting here listening, and thinking that it was a prime example of how the Conservative government is so out of touch with ordinary Canadians, with ordinary Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, and with people on the east and west coasts. It is absolutely out of touch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318129">The hon. member just mentioned shutting down debate. What we are actually debating here is the third omnibus bill. Again, an omnibus bill is massive. This particular bill has 49 pieces of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318130">Why would the Conservative government take 49 pieces of legislation and cram them into one omnibus bill? It is because it does not want debate.

              <ParaText id="3318131">Mr. Speaker, in my time today I would like to spotlight the really positive measures in economic action plan 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318132">Today's bill would ensure that Canada keeps a strong position relative to so many other countries in the world and avoids the mistakes of so many others around the world as well. It would do that by promoting jobs and growth, and supporting families and communities across the country, all while respecting taxpayer dollars. There are literally so many great and positive measures in the bill that I want to quickly run down the list for Canadians at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318133">To build a strong economy and promote job growth, here are just a few of the great things in the bill: We are extending tax relief for new investments in machinery and equipment by Canadian manufacturers. We are indexing gas tax fund payments to better support job-creating infrastructure in municipalities across Canada. We are extending for one year the mineral exploration tax credit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318134">Our government is providing $165 million in multi-year support for genomics research through Genome Canada. To help young entrepreneurs grow their firms, our Conservative government is providing $18 million to the Canadian Youth Business Foundation. This government is also providing $5 million to Indspire for post-secondary scholarships and bursaries for first nations and Inuit students. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318135">And there is so much more good news in the budget for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318136">To support families and communities we are also doing so many great things, and I want to explain how that transpires. Our Conservative government is promoting adoption by enhancing the adoption expense tax credit to better recognize the costs of adopting a child. We are introducing a new first-time donor super credit for first-time claimants of the charitable donations tax credit to encourage all young Canadians to donate to charity. To better meet the health care needs of Canadians, our government is expanding tax relief for home care services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318137">We are removing tariffs on imports of baby clothing and certain sports equipment. This will help families all across the nation. Our government is providing $30 million in the 2013-14 budget to support the construction of new housing in Nunavut. We are investing $20 million in the Nature Conservancy of Canada to continue to conserve ecologically sensitive land. We are providing $3 million to the Pallium Foundation of Canada to support training and palliative care for front-line health care providers. As members know, we have an aging demographic in our country and this is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318138">Our government is committing $3 million to the Canadian National Institute for the Blind to expand library services for the blind and partially sighted. I just met with some members from that community and they are so grateful for this $3 million because it will enhance their quality of life. We are supporting veterans and their families by no longer deducting veterans' disability benefits when calculating other select benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318139">And we are doing so much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318140">I honestly have to ask NDP and Liberal members opposite: how can they possibly vote against these great items? How can they possibly vote against all these positive measures for Canadians? How can they oppose helping the blind get library services? How can they oppose supporting palliative care? How can they oppose helping out our veterans? Along with their constituents at home, I am waiting for the answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318141">Unlike the opposition, our government understands that Canadian businesses big and small are faced with new economic challenges originating beyond our borders. That is why Canada's economic action plan would lower taxes, slash unnecessary red tape and improve conditions for new and growing businesses. The economic action plan 2013 act proposes the next wave of initiatives to preserve these gains and create high paying, value-added jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318142">On the advice of the Canadian manufacturing industry, we are providing $1.4 billion of tax relief to the manufacturing sector through a two-year extension of the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance for new investment in machinery and equipment. This tax relief would encourage manufacturers and processors to continue to invest in machinery and equipment, making their operations more productive and globally competitive.</ParaText>

We plan to support job creators, such as junior mineral exploration companies, by extending for one year the 15% mineral exploration tax credit for flow-through share investors. We would also clarify the rules for how we would treat proposed investments in Canada by foreign state-owned enterprises and would allow for the extension of timelines for national security reviews by modernizing the Investment Canada Act. </ParaText>

We welcome that. Unfortunately, there is little else in the budget for persons with disabilities. In fact, 50% of people with disabilities in our country are unemployed. That climbs to 80% when it is developmental disabilities. There is nothing to change that. There is no action by the government on ratifying the UN convention on persons with disabilities.

              <ParaText id="3318168">Canada has experienced one of the best economic performances among the G7 countries, both during the global recession and throughout the recovery. Due to our strong economic policies, our global reputation is highly respected and admired by countries around the world. It has earned us, for the fifth year in a row, the reputation of the soundest banking system in the world from the World Economic Forum.</ParaText>

This includes connecting Canadians with available jobs, helping manufacturers and businesses succeed in the global economy, creating a new building Canada plan, investing in world-class research and innovation, and supporting families and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318170">Our government understands that, while we have a strong economic reputation, we need to remember that Canada is not immune to the instability of the global economy. We need strong leadership, and that is exactly what our government would provide with Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, as I will outline in my remaining time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318171">In my riding of Oxford, manufacturing is the source of employment for many residents and is one of the key engines of the Canadian economy. Since 2006, our government has supported the manufacturing industry by lowering business taxes to 15%, which allows manufacturers to keep more of their money to invest and hire more employees; investing $110 million to double support to manufacturers and other entrepreneurs through the industrial research assistance program; eliminating the job-killing corporate tax; and much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318172">With Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, we would provide even more support for new investments in machinery and equipment for the manufacturing and processing sector. This would be done by extending the accelerated capital cost allowance for two years, which would increase the support for manufacturers by almost $1.4 billion. I know this support would benefit manufacturers in Oxford and across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318173"> Our government believes in keeping taxes low for all Canadians. Since 2006, we have cut taxes more than 150 times, reducing the overall tax burden to its lowest level in 50 years. That translates into a total savings of $3,200 for a typical Canadian family of four.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318174">We would build on these already astounding savings with even more tax relief for Canadians. In Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, we would eliminate consumer tariffs on babies' clothing, sporting goods and exercise equipment. In total, this would provide $76 million in tariff relief for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318175">We would also introduce a temporary first-time donor's tax credit to encourage more Canadians, and those who had not donated recently, to give to charity. This would not only help a plethora of charities but also provide $25 million in annual tax relief. The savings just keep getting better and better under our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318176">Youth are the future, and that is why our government believes in providing young Canadians with the information and opportunities they need to make smart education and employment decisions. Our investments in youth since 2006 have included expanding the eligibility for Canada student loans through a reduction in the expected parental contribution; investing more than $300 million per year through the youth employment strategy to help young Canadians get the skills and work experience they need to transition into the workplace; and reducing the in-study interest rate for part-time students to zero, saving them approximately $5.6 million per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318177">In Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, we would support Canadian youth even more by providing funding of $18 million in multi-year support for the Canadian Youth Business Foundation. This foundation is a national not-for-profit organization that works with young entrepreneurs between the ages of 18 and 34 by helping them become the business leaders of tomorrow through mentorship, expert advice, learning resources and start-up financing.

This program provides assistance to low-income veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War, as well as their survivors. Under the current program, a veteran's total calculated income includes a disability pension provided by Veterans Affairs Canada.

Amendments in Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> will no longer allow the government to take the disability pension into account when determining eligibility and in calculating benefits provided under the war veterans allowance.

Canada's economic prosperity is supported by a network of highways and roads, waste water infrastructure, transit systems and recreation and cultural facilities. This network reaches into every community and touches every Canadian. In recognition of the importance of efficient prosperity and quality of life, our government has made significant investments since 2006 to build roads, bridges, subways, rail and much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318183">In Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, we are continuing this support through the community improvement fund. This fund includes $21.8 billion over 10 years through the gas tax fund payments. Currently at $2 billion per year, we are proposing that these payments be indexed at 2% per year starting in 2014-15, with increases applied in $100-million increments. The list of existing eligible investment categories would be expanded to include highways, local and regional airports, short-line rail, short-sea shipping, disaster mitigation, broadband and connectivity, brownfield redevelopment, culture, tourism, sports and recreation. The fund would also include $10.4 billion over 10 years under the incremental GST rebate for municipalities to provide communities with additional resources for the maintenance and operation of existing public infrastructure and facilities. </ParaText>

We are not permitted to discuss it in the House of Commons beyond the end of today, and we have been told that there will be only five days of debate in committee.

As I pointed out earlier, it will not take effect until there have been three more budgets, and those three more budgets will probably not be studied in any great detail, because the government is so fond of limiting debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318200">Mr. Speaker, if we would just let loose a bit, we could really have quite an interesting debate on the budget in this House. We could really talk back and forth with one another about what we think should be in there versus all the fantasy comments being made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318201">It is a very convincing argument, if somebody on the other side is actually listening to it and believing it. Again, that is what governments do. I have been there. We stand up and promote our budgets and say that they are the best thing since sliced bread. We all do it. However, our job on this side at the moment is to ensure that we show its flaws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318202">I am happy to be standing here and speaking. This will be the 10th budget I have been asked to evaluate and vote on since I was elected to the House, so I have been around long enough to have seen them from all sides. In that time, I have seen both good and bad fiscal plans. Again, I have to say that I think budget 2013 is probably the most disappointing because of the federal fiscal strategy we are being asked to consider. It is not a strategy I think Canadians would really want us to support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318203">Let us have a bit of history. In 2006, the Conservative government came to power by making outlandish guarantees, and the Canadian public, or 39% of it anyway, bought those outlandish guarantees. In fact, the Conservatives promised to leave any notion of Conservative fiscal tendencies buried in a sea of red ink. At the time, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made the absurd commitment that he would somehow reduce taxes while also making radical spending increases, and we all know that this does not work. Of course, what did the Prime Minister do? He increased spending, a move that erased the $14-billion surplus the Conservatives inherited from the Liberals when they came into power. What did they do with that? They immediately turned around and invested it. Some people would say that they used that $14 billion of taxpayer money to buy the votes for the next election. Whatever happened, they got $14 billion and spent it very quickly. I can only imagine that Brian Mulroney would have loved to have had something like $14 billion to spend on all the things he wanted to try to achieve with a majority government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318204">Unfortunately, once the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had recklessly spent the cupboard bare, he started increasing income taxes, payroll taxes. Then the Conservatives found new and creative ways to levy hefty fees and tariffs on everyday essentials, such as cancer wigs, household appliances, home heating oil and even blankets. Then, of course, what came? It was a severe rollback of vital income supports and social systems that low-income Canadians rely on each day for survival. The current government slashed support for seniors; attacked middle-class families; and advanced policies that all but slam the door on anyone who is sick, elderly, underemployed or generally working class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318205">However, this is not the first time Canada's finances have been run into the ground at the hands of the so-called Conservative Party. The last time a Conservative government actually balanced a federal budget in Canada was 101 years ago, in 1912. I know that the Conservatives would like to rewrite history, but they cannot erase everything. That is clearly in the history books. The last time any Conservative government ever balanced a budget was 101 years ago. When we hear all this wonderful pie-in-the-sky stuff, we have to keep that in mind. That Prime Minister was Robert Borden. He too inherited a surplus from a good Liberal predecessor, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Just as the current government did, Borden managed to maintain it for only one year before dropping into deficit. It sounds as if our current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is following the Borden example through excessive spending and reckless budgeting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318206">Between 2006 and 2008, the Conservatives put Canada back into the red, well before, not after, there was any recession. Well before, we were already in debt. Despite their rolling promises of restraint and prudence, they have not balanced the books since.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318207">Now in budget 2013, the Conservatives promise that they will eliminate the deficit by 2015. Of course, they have made that promise before, and they just cannot seem to hit their targets. So far, the Conservatives have missed every target, but they expect us to believe that on the eve of the next federal election, somehow they are going to have fixed up the mess and will have balanced the budget.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318208">I think a closer look at the financial plan would provide every reason for all of us as parliamentarians, and all of us as taxpayers, to be very suspicious of the pie-in-the-sky numbers that the Conservatives are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318209">It has been said by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> that the Conservative playbook contains seven simple tricks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318210">They inflate revenues by basing their fiscal planning on optimistic projections of economic growth. They ignore the reality, as they have before, that their numbers have never been correct. Time and time again their forecasts have been proven to be wrong, as both the IMF and the Bank of Canada have done once again in the past month. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318211">They also create the illusion of financial flexibility. Conservatives have lowballed the reserves that should be in place to serve as fiscal shock absorbers against future economic setbacks. They have no contingency plan other than spending on the national credit card. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318212">When a government department does not use all of its budget, the excess money lapses back to the treasury. The Conservatives are counting on very large lapses over the next several years. In other words, they are making big announcements, hoping that everything will go the way they want it to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318213">While cracking down on those who do not pay their taxes is an absolute necessity, and for that we give them two points of credit, the Conservatives claim of a balanced budget depends heavily upon quickly collecting billions in unpaid taxes. That seems highly improbable, given that they are also chopping millions of dollars from the same agency that is supposed to be going after the cheaters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318214">For big programs like infrastructure, the government claims to be increasing investments. We talked about that a bit earlier. However, any increases are actually years away, and our cities and FCM know that. It is a trick called “back-end loading”. In reality, the build Canada infrastructure budget has been slashed, not increased by $1.5 billion, in each of the next two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318215">Despite false claims to the contrary, the government is increasing taxes in dozens of nefarious ways, on everything from hospital parking fees to blankets. The two biggest types of Conservative tax hikes are higher tariffs on imported goods and higher employment insurance payroll taxes. Again, this would hurt our small businesses in Canada that we need to be promoting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318216">Then there is the one that they are forever planning: using all these tricks to concoct the false illusion of a balanced budget by 2015. The Conservatives will claim to have met their fiscal objective just before an election, and before proof to the contrary can become available we will be back into another election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318217">We all know that people struggle with their day-to-day expenses, from diapers to Kleenex, to formula and healthy food. The cost of raising a family is growing in Canada. We all know seniors who rely upon that monthly OAS/GIS cheque to keep their lights on and food on the table. This is in our rich Canada. We all know of someone who is desperately looking for work so they can keep their family in their home. These are the people who budget 2013 has forgotten: working-class Canadians who do not fit into the Conservative plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318218">The Conservatives are trying to trick Canadians into thinking they have the experience necessary to champion the economy, but in reality they are little more than professional grifters with a billion-dollar publicly funded advertising budget that is constantly telling us how well we are doing with the economic action plan that is paid for by them. It might be time for the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2"> Prime Minister</Affiliation> to admit that while there are solutions, he is not thinking of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318219">The budget includes a bail-in regime that would allow banks to generate capital by dipping into the savings of their account holders. The budget increases taxes and tariffs on middle-income Canadians and businesses, and the budget abdicates federal responsibility for a range of important scientific, social and economic programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318220">I think budget 2013 betrays the trust of Canadians and shows just how devoid of compassion and trust they are.</ParaText>

Now the rest of the world is looking at Canada as the example of how to make it through and continue to provide a balance between keeping an eye on the bottom line while being able to make strategic investments to help grow our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318238">Since July 2009, we have seen the Canadian economy add over 900,000 jobs. Our employment levels are nearly back to where they were in pre-recession levels. The typical Canadian household now pays more than $3,000 less in tax each year, and seniors pay more than $2,000 less each year. We have reduced the GST to 7% and harmonized the 7% and 5%. It has made a big difference, especially in the province of Ontario, which I represent. We on this side have a lot to be proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318239">The opposition members have continued to criticize what we have done. However, time and time again we have proven them wrong. We continue to deliver for Canadians and the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318240">One point I would like to highlight with respect to Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, our budget implementation bill, is the gas tax fund. This has been an important mechanism for municipalities, and in my area, the counties, to continue to deliver on key infrastructure projects. We know that in 2009 our government doubled that from $1 billion to $2 billion, which was a huge investment commitment to our communities. Whether those projects are water, sewer, roads or bridges, it has provided the municipalities with long-term stable funding. It is ironic that at a time when Ontario is clawing back what it provides to rural municipalities, our government, in spite of a deficit and tough economic times, has continued to deliver that funding to our municipalities. With this BIA, we are expanding and indexing that. More importantly, we are expanding the number of areas that can be covered and where we are making investments for municipalities, such as economic development, shipping, whether through water, rail or airports, and broadband, to allow them to continue to develop and grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318241">That is a key and important factor for economic development in the municipalities and counties in rural southwestern Ontario. Also, it is important to be able to apply some of that to economic development and tourism in the riding of Huron—Bruce, which from north to south along Lake Huron on the west side is known as Ontario's west coast. It is important that our municipalities can continue to deliver services to American tourists as well as those from the cities, so they can enjoy what we have and, more importantly, drive on safe roads and have safe reliable water and sewer services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318242">I will provide some information just to give members an idea of the scope and scale dollar-wise that we are able to deliver on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318243">When our government came into office in 2006, Bruce County received just a little over $600,000 in funding; Huron Country received $582,000; and Central Huron, the municipality within which I live, received $76,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318244">In the 2011-12 budget year, the annual investment made by our government into Bruce County had more than tripled, to nearly $2 million from $600,000 just a few years ago. For Huron County it was $1.8 million, and for Central Huron it was $234,000.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318245">The opposition likes to do a lot of talking and criticizing, but the fact is that those are real dollars going into our communities that are helping to make our roads better, our sewers operate at a higher efficiency and our drinking water clean. As we move forward, it would provide great opportunities for the topics I have mentioned in the past. These are all positives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318246">FCM is strongly behind us, as is the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, AMO. As well, if we look at the average age of our infrastructure, it is coming down from 17 years on average to 14 years. That is delivering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318247">I have not mentioned the massive commitments we made through the downturn, through RInC and accelerations through the building Canada fund, which helped to get projects on the go. In my riding where there is a huge number of contractors and so forth, it kept them at work and allowed them to make new investments in their machinery and keep people on. I think that really helped deliver, and it is something we can all be proud of, at least on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318248">Another area we need to focus on, which some of my colleagues have touched on, is the commitment to the last post fund. For people watching at home and members in opposition who are listening, I should mention that our government, in the face of recession and economic downturn, maintained our funding to veterans. We did not cut and run, we did not duck, but we maintained our investment and funding to our veterans. Members can go back just a few short years to see the investments we made with the new veterans charter. We completely enhanced it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318249">I can hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> pecking away, and usually when the truth and the facts start coming out, his blood pressure starts to go up. He was there 20 years ago when the Liberals went in and slashed benefits to veterans, especially our allied vets, the whole gamut. However I will try to stay focused on the last post fund at this time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318250">We would double the amount we commit to veterans in need from $3,600 to more than $7,200 a year. This is important because those men and women served us well in World War II and in Korea; they put their lives on the line. When they came back from battle, some had ailments or impairments, which they likely lived with for their entire lives. However, through the hard knocks of life sometimes, maybe the finances did not come out as they would have hoped, which is why we are here for them today, so they can receive a funeral that represents their commitment and sacrifice to the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318251">It is a shame, specifically when looking at this, that the opposition would not support this bill just on that alone. It would show the support, that this can be a non-partisan event and that we can all vote together on this BIA to show veterans from one coast to the other that we are all in it together with them on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318252">The last post fund runs this program in a highly efficient manner. Every dollar it receives goes toward the program and there is virtually nothing in it for administration. The fund does a great job, and I am very proud that we would be able to deliver and in a way that respects its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318253">I previously worked in the manufacturing sector, and I wanted to touch upon the fact that our accelerated capital cost allowance would be renewed for two years at 50% from the previous 30%. Basically, this would allow businesses to make investments right off their machinery in three years instead of nine years, which is hugely important, especially in Ontario because of its manufacturing and industrial base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318254"> I could do a 30-minute speech on all the investments we have made in manufacturing in Ontario and, Mr. Speaker, being from Windsor, you would certainly know of some of those investments that have benefited your region. However, I am sure members of the opposition have a question or two, maybe even the member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>, and I welcome them.</ParaText>

I serve with the member on the veterans committee. He is indeed one of the hard-working members of the committee and someone who I think really does have the interests of veterans at heart. This is why some of his remarks with respect to the government's record on veterans are somewhat troubling. When he trumpets the fact that the government says it has maintained funding for veterans, he forgets that there have been more than 800 job cuts. He forgets that there has been a download of services to Service Canada at the very same time that it is making cuts; cuts of 46% in my province. He forgets about the comments that were made by the Auditor General, highly critical of the case management services provided by Veterans Affairs. I would add that my province is the only one that has no case managers. They were all taken out in the last budget.</ParaText>

Of those two-thirds that were rejected prior to these changes, how many of those two-thirds of veterans who were rejected would now receive help under the fund? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318270">Although the federal government claimed it would negotiate pragmatic agreements with the Government of Quebec in good faith, instead it is directly attacking Quebec's unique approach with measures announced in budget 2013 and Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, the budget implementation bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318271">I would like to ask the government what happened to negotiating in good faith. Where were the negotiations on the labour program that will deprive Quebec of millions of dollars? Where were the negotiations on abolishing the tax credit for labour-sponsored funds? Where were the negotiations on higher taxes for the Caisses populaires Desjardins, which will wipe out a portion of Quebec members' dividends? Where were the negotiations following the unanimous vote by the National Assembly to retain Quebec's jurisdiction over securities? Where were the negotiations after the National Assembly's unanimous vote to keep Quebec's approach to homelessness? Where were the negotiations following the unanimous vote by the National Assembly against changes to worker training? Where were negotiations following the unanimous vote by the National Assembly against changes to employment insurance? Where were negotiations when the federal government imposed, once again, the “Ottawa knows best” doctrine to the detriment of Quebec's organizations and Quebec's approach? Where were the negotiations with Quebec when the federal government decided to finance the Lower Churchill project? Where were the negotiations with Quebec following the recognition of the Quebec nation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318273">Let us talk about employment insurance. As hon. members will recall, previous budgets have chipped away at the very foundation of our social safety net: government services and the old age security program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318274">Budget implementation Bills <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document> were also a direct attack on seasonal workers and the regional economy of some areas of Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318275">To justify its employment insurance reform, which harshly penalizes the economy in regions like the Lower St. Lawrence and the Gaspé, the government claims that it is trying to connect unemployed workers to available jobs, but really, it is tearing up its labour market agreement with Quebec, which helps unemployed workers find jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318276">In the last couple of budgets, the federal government has been trying to centralize Canada's economic development at the expense of Quebec's land use strategies, the well-being of the people in the regions and regional economic development. The federal government is trying to gradually strip us of our dignity and our pride in our distinct identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318277">With last year's budget, it was clear that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was continuing to build his version of Canada based on his values and interests. He proved that there was no room for Quebec to develop within that model. This year's budget is simply more of the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318278">Budget 2013 is a direct attack on the way Quebec does things. As for labour market issues, Ottawa will take away millions of dollars from Quebec that helped the unemployed find jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318279">In its place, the federal government is pushing a program that will force employers and the Quebec government to provide more money if they want the federal government to contribute. In order to hand out cheques with the maple leaf on them, the federal government is ready to axe initiatives that are working well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318280">Ottawa also wants to bring in a new formula whereby the federal government, the provinces and employers would put in up to $5,000 each to train workers. Although worker training falls under provincial jurisdiction, the federal government is stubbornly forging ahead, to the detriment of our financial services industry. The Quebec Minister of Finance has also criticized this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318281">Now I would like to talk about labour-sponsored funds. The elimination of the labour-sponsored funds tax credit is another direct attack on Quebec and its workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318282">In addition to impoverishing people who are trying to save for their retirement, the federal government is also going to deprive Quebec SMEs of a key economic lever. Labour-sponsored funds are an integral part of Quebec's economic organization, as demonstrated by the fact that $312 million of the $355 million Ottawa plans to take away from workers will be from Quebec.</ParaText>

Quebeckers, including unionized workers, use these funds as savings vehicles and commit to helping develop Quebec businesses, such as social economy businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318284">Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> again includes provisions on securities, as mentioned in the latest budget.

              <ParaText id="3318285">In response to the federal government's budget, the Government of Quebec said, “Allowing the federal government to insinuate itself in securities regulation, which is within Québec’s exclusive jurisdiction, is out of the question.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318286">We have long known that Canada's <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> dreams of getting his hands on Quebec securities. Even after he was turned down by the Quebec National Assembly and the Supreme Court of Canada, the minister has not concealed his intentions to interfere in Quebec's key financial sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318287">I would like to talk about homelessness and how the government does not respect Quebec's way of doing things. In its latest budget, the federal government said it supports the housing first approach, which could threaten community-based, universal homelessness initiatives that currently respond to very real needs in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318288">According to the Réseau Solidarité itinérance du Québec, all of the support services for some 50,000 people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless are in jeopardy as a result of the federal government's new policy. The federal government's actions on homelessness are worrisome. In addition to reducing funding, Ottawa wants to impose its housing first approach, which will force Quebec to sacrifice its expertise and the programs tailored to its needs. The National Assembly unanimously denounced Ottawa's attitude and asked that the homelessness strategy be redesigned according to the existing model and in compliance with Quebec's policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318289">The Bloc Québécois thinks that the federal government's approach is unacceptable. It could severely hamper the work that people have done over the years on this issue. It would disregard the expertise that has been developed over time to reach the people in need most effectively. This is a direct attack on Quebec's way of doing things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318290">I would now like to talk about health transfers and social programs. Budget 2013 is one step closer to a $36 billion reduction in federal health transfers. It will have devastating consequences on Quebec's finances because it imposes new agreements for equalization, health transfers and social programs and withdraws money transferred to Quebec for worker training. This is essentially a slap in the face for Quebec. To achieve a zero deficit, the Conservatives, like the Liberals before them, are lobbing the deficit into Quebec's court. Budget 2013 ushers in fiscal imbalance once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318291">For all these reasons, and many others, the Bloc Québécois will not support the next federal budget, a budget that is unfair to Quebec, takes aim at Quebec and takes away some of its fundamental powers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318295">Basically, the government is trying to interfere in various ways in the internal policies of crown corporations. This is not the first time the government has done that; it has done so in the past. That is clear once again today, and in other recent events. Among other things, the government wants to be involved in the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318296">As members may recall, the CBC's new code of ethics, imposed by the federal government less than a year ago, may also be dangerous, since it infringes on journalistic freedom and integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318297">The government now wants to interfere in collective agreements, which is completely unacceptable. Crown corporations must remain at arm's length from the government to remain independent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318298">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague across the way for his speech. Although we know that he does not support the government's budget, which is no surprise since he is part of the Bloc Québécois, there are measures in the budget that are good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318299">I would like to ask him about one of the points in the budget and how important it is to his municipality. Every time I go to the gas station and fill up my car or my truck, there is about a 10-cent excise tax. That 10 cents that the governments collect gets transferred back through the provinces to the municipalities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318300">The fuel tax rebate is a major thing for our municipalities, as we heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170244" Type="2">Huron—Bruce</Affiliation>. It has tripled over the last number of years. Municipalities now know that they are going to be receiving that much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318301">What it also does is allow the municipalities to borrow, knowing that the money is coming. The budget would also implement a measure that would not only guarantee that it is going to happen but that it would be indexed, so that as inflation goes, municipalities know that the indexed amount will be there to help.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318304">He is right. The government's infrastructure program is very helpful to municipalities. As a mayor in my former life, I was able to benefit from the program and passed that on to my municipality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318305">This program helps municipalities complete infrastructure work within a reasonable time frame. However, the problem is that the numbers announced in the last Conservative government budget were shared with municipalities in 2010. Now it has become a permanent program, but the new money that we would have liked to see added to the program is not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318306">Unfortunately, there is no money for 2013. There is just $203 million on top of the $53 billion for 2014. There is only $203 million for 2015. In fact, municipalities will have access to all of the money only after the 2015 election.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3318308">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the House again and to speak in support not only of the budget but also of Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, which is the budget implementation bill. It lays out the measures the Conservative government will bring forward in the economic action plan for 2013 and onward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318309">One of the reasons why I am pleased to stand and speak to the budget bill is the amount of work that we did in the riding of Crowfoot. Prior to the budget being given, we had meetings throughout the riding at Strathmore Town Hall and other town halls where constituents came together to say what they believed was important to have in the budget. I am going to talk a little more about how some of those ideas have been moved here and how our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and our government are implementing some of those ideas that come from back home and from many different constituencies across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318310">I believe, first of all, that this is a very positive blueprint, a very positive strategy as to how we believe the Canadian economy must be advanced and built. We would be strengthening the economy in a number of ways through this budget implementation bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318311">First of all, we would be helping manufacturers to buy new equipment through tax relief. We would be helping small business create more jobs with the hiring credit. We would be helping our municipalities rebuild roads and bridges with record new support in infrastructure, and there is much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318312">This budget builds on the work our Conservative government has been doing since forming government in 2006. We are working to create an economy that will build jobs. It is not that our government is going to create jobs; we are going to create an environment in which small and medium-sized businesses can create jobs and make certain that those families that now have jobs will be able to keep more of their money in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318313">Canada has been quite successful. We have over 900,000 net new jobs since the depths of this recession took place. More than 90% of those 900,000 jobs that have been created are full-time jobs, contrary to what many of the opposition members say when they say that these are the wrong kinds of jobs, part-time jobs, just not the right kinds of jobs. Some 80% of the jobs are in the private sector. This is not job creation through continuing to expand the size of government. The majority, 80%, are in the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318314">Canada has a very good record as far as job creation goes. In fact, we have the best record of the seven most industrialized countries in the world, the G7. The International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development project that Canada's growth will be among the strongest in the G7 for a number of years going forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318315">For the fifth straight year, the World Economic Forum has ranked Canada's banking system as the soundest in the world. Canada has the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G7. Canada is one of the few countries that still has the Triple A credit rating. Our combined national debt to gross domestic product ratio remains the lowest in the G7 by far. Why? It is because there is a plan and a strategy. The strategy in the past five years has been working, and the strategy moving forward is building on that and will continue to work, although the opposition feels somewhat concerned because the statistics that are coming out are exactly what Canadians, including my constituents, want to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318316">The opposition members call for more spending—spend, spend, spend—and they have the tax increases to pay for their spending. I am not going to talk much about the $20 billion or $21 billion carbon tax they are discussing, but they have an idea on how government can be expanded, how government can get bigger, and they would love to see that happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318317">One of the reasons I am pleased with this budget is that government expansion is not going to happen under this watch. Opposition members would expand government and add to the national debt. What happens to countries that take that route? What happens to countries that choose to go down that road?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318318">Canadians do not have to just sit back and surmise what may happen. We can take a look at what did happen in Europe. Governments burdened their citizens with unmanageable annual budgetary deficits, massive accumulated debt, huge and paralyzing government bureaucracies. What about unemployment in some of those countries? Unemployment in the eurozone tops 12%. In some of the countries, it is much higher than 12%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318319">Our Conservative government understands that Canadians want us to continue to emphasize the importance of maintaining Canada's strong fiscal position, especially during current difficult global economic times. To be quite frank, that is one of the major reasons we were elected. One of the reasons we were elected to a majority government is they understood this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is the Prime Minister Canadians want to see, especially at a time when the global economy is in turmoil. Canadians want that type of leadership. Canadians know that our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> have built a stellar reputation for Canada in the international marketplace. Canadians want a stable government, one that is capable of making decisions, sometimes swiftly, and implementing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318320">For many years I have heard from my constituents in all corners of the riding of Crowfoot that I represent about the importance of balancing our books. My constituents want our federal government to operate without having to borrow money to pay for a deficit every year. My constituents are farmers, ranchers and small business operators. The gas and oil sector is major in my riding of Crowfoot, but we also have a tourism industry in Drumheller and the Canadian badlands that is somewhat seasonal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318321">All of the families in my riding, from smaller towns, villages and cities, are all very careful in how they operate, and they want to balance their budgets around their kitchen table. That is the type of discussion they have. How are we going to be able to pass this farm on to the next generation? How can we operate within a balanced budget?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318322">Our government is on track to balance the budget. One of the things that made me very pleased in the last budget speech was when our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> rose and said, “...before I proceed, I need to make one thing very clear. It is simply this. Our government is committed to balancing the budget in 2015.” When he stood and said that, a burden was lifted off my shoulders, because that was the message that my constituents wanted to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318323">On page 12 of the budget there is a chart that says in 2012-13 there is a projected deficit of just over $25 billion; in 2013-14 we will have a deficit of $18.7 billion; in 2014-15 we will have a deficit of over $6 billion; and by 2015 we will be at a surplus of almost $1 billion. In the two years after the budgetary surplus, it is projected to grow by $4 billion and then $5 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318324">How are we projecting? We see the official opposition coming forward with these budgets with nothing costed, nothing planned out and nothing on paper. We have a very concise strategy that has worked in the past, is working now and will continue to work in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318325">From 2006-08, our government paid down approximately $37 billion in debt. When the global recession hit, we made a deliberate decision to run temporary deficits to protect the Canadian economy, and that plan worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318326">We have helped create over 900,000 net new jobs, and we are on track to come back to balanced budgets. At the same time, we are doing things. The deficit reduction action plan is recognizing that we want to quickly come to balanced budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318327">We have an ongoing effort to control government spending. We work continuously to eliminate wasteful and inefficient spending. In total, our government implemented measures that will reduce the deficit by over $15 billion per year in 2014, 2015 and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318328">Economic action plan 2013 announced saving measures that will total $2 billion by 2015-16, such as examining departmental spending to make sure we are operating efficiently, reducing travel costs, modernizing the production and distribution of government publications, and standardizing government information technology to reduce costs. We are closing tax loopholes. We are improving compliance programs to reduce tax evasion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318330">Mr. Speaker, I listened with fascination once again to the revisionist history that comes from the Conservative benches on what caused the global crisis. The Conservatives would purport that it was social programs in Europe that crushed the world economy when in fact it was the deregulation of the banking sector and irresponsible speculation in Ireland, Iceland and Goldman Sachs in the United States. That is the record. The fact that there was not clear regulation in place was what caused it. I find it disturbing that my colleague was attempting to claim that it was social programs in Europe that destroyed it. I see the continual attack on social programs in this country, which the current government is carrying out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318331">My hon. colleague talks about the fact that the Conservatives are good fiscal managers. We just had the Auditor General's report in which he said that the current government has no ability to account for $3.1 billion in spending. When Jean Chrétien said he lost $1 million and it was no big deal, the Reform backbenchers went crazy on it. They were jumping up and down in their seats. Now they cannot account for $3.1 billion. There is no trust in this government among the Canadian public.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318336">I was just going back through my notes again. If I left the hon. member with the impression that I am saying that Europe and the social programs were the cause for this recession, that is not what I said. I said that it was the issues in Europe and certainly in the United States, the housing markets and the banking industry. In fact, I went on and spoke about the sound banking that we have in this country, and that goes back years to other governments as well that laid out certain regulations for our banking industry.

It was out of the terrorism file, and going back to the former Liberal government of 2001 when all of a sudden we were thrown into quick responses on the terrorism file. Some things maybe were taken out of other departments. However, the Auditor General said that no money is missing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318338">Mr. Speaker, last week the government quietly tabled a report, and it was interesting where it stated that the government reduced the number of employees from 278,092 to 262,902 from March 31 to December 31 of last year. Of the more than 15,000 jobs that were eliminated, 8,000 were full-time indeterminate positions, a reduction of about 3%. The remaining roughly 7,000 positions that were eliminated were for students and casual, or term, employees, the report indicated. The document, an annual report by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the public service, shows students and casual employees, often women and younger members of the workforce, took the biggest hit.</ParaText>

That is, it will be done through retirements. Some of the student layoffs and some of those things that the member makes reference to, although I have not seen the report, very well could be in temporary types of jobs as the employees are between college and another initiative.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318344">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to rise to speak against the budget before us, both on content and on process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318345">Here we go again. We have a massive budget bill, over 100 pages, impacting innumerable statutes and bills that need to be debated in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318346">My colleagues seem to find this funny. It is not about being able to read. I can assure them I have learned to read at a fairly fast pace and comprehend. It is about Canadians' rights to have the budget debated in this House for transparency and for discussion. It is about giving duly elected members of Parliament an opportunity to do their jobs as elected officials by providing debate and discussion, and asking questions. That is what is being denied once again in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318347">On content, the budget does very little, if anything, to grow jobs for Canadians. It does even less to protect the jobs that exist for Canadians. It does very little to address the major challenges facing everyday Canadian families as they struggle to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318348">The Conservatives are trying to say that they can just rush through the bill, maybe because they really believe there is not much in the bill and they have a lot to hide. Maybe they are too scared to have Canadians look at the bill and know that there are no job creation measures, that there is nothing to make life more affordable and nothing to strengthen the services families rely on. Once again, the government is trying to avoid public scrutiny of the measures it is trying to ram through this House at breakneck speed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318349">I also want to take the opportunity today to talk a little about an area that really impacts on immigration, citizenship and multiculturalism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318350">First, the bill continues a pattern with which the government has made us all too familiar. It just keeps concentrating more and more power in the hands of the ministers so they do not have to come back into this House in a parliamentary democracy to have what they are trying to do examined in any way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318351">The government has made a complete mess of the temporary foreign worker program. We have seen it over and over again in the media, whether it is HD Mining in B.C.; the backlog of the live-in caregiver program, which the minister himself addressed and is facing major problems and needs major overhaul; or the temporary foreign worker program that is currently under scrutiny because of the outsourcing of jobs at RBC. Despite all of that media attention on it, what actions has the government really taken? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318352">Canadians were doing jobs that workers were brought in to do, but Canadians were then asked, “By the way, before you leave, can you train these new workers?” Once again, Canadians are being denied Canadian jobs.</ParaText>

They were brought to Canada as skilled workers, only to lose their jobs once they acquired permanent residency, or were let go just before they qualified to apply for permanent residency, and therefore a new batch of temporary foreign workers could be brought in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318354">Over the last number of weeks we have heard again and again about staggering abuses. The accelerated labour market opinions, only ever meant for highly skilled workers, were used and abused in a way that once again shocked Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Intra-company transfers were an abuse of the system in a massive way. Where are the investigations for all of these and where are the fixes?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318355">The government, by the way, has had an opportunity—no, several opportunities over several years—to fix the temporary foreign worker program. There was, again, an opportunity with this bill, but rather than actually fixing a program that is wrought with flaws, a program that desperately needs an entire overhaul to function and be administered properly, the Conservatives slap band-aids on the holes, but only once they are exposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318356">Faulty LMOs are being doled out. It is not a problem for the government. It simply gives the minister the power to suspend or revoke work permits that have already been handed out, but only if they are caught and there is public oversight. Once again, this is being done at the same time that the government is cutting funding to CIC and, therefore, limiting the kind of oversight that can be done over these files, over the granting of LMOs and the granting of the permits that go along with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318357">Rather than addressing the full scope of the problems with this program, the Conservatives' band-aid in this case is another ministerial override when work permits and labour market opinions that have already been approved by them—and this is post-approval, by the way—become political hot potatoes. It is all political expediency and a public relations exercise. This bill's improvements would not get to the heart of the mismanagement of the temporary foreign worker program under the Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318358">Next, this bill introduces privilege fees to be set out in regulations for employers that apply for work permits. The minister has announced that this fee would be in addition to the new fees announced in budget 2013 for servicing TFW applications. The intention of the new fee, apparently, is to act as a disincentive for unnecessary use of the program. Of course, given the government's record to date, there is no assurance that these fees would not be passed on to the temporary foreign workers themselves and there is no measure anywhere cited to ensure that they would not be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318359">The government is now trying to fix problems it created. The last time it tried to fix problems, it allowed employers to pay up to 15% less and, guess what, there was a massive denial of that in the House. Then, outside at a press conference, the minister said that program was gone. The ALMO, which was hastily implemented and then not administered, with very little oversight and abuse, was allowed to happen and has been suspended temporarily—and I would say it was allowed to happen because the ALMOs that were granted went way beyond the parameters that were set out for this particular program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318360">Once again, I want to say that we in the NDP are not opposed to a temporary foreign worker program that addresses the legitimate needs of skills shortages and acute labour shortages where no Canadians are available to do the work. That is what we stand for and yet, instead of protecting Canadian jobs and addressing the abuses that are happening, the government is once again looking for band-aid solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318361">Forgive my skepticism, but we learned only yesterday that the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> completely disregarded a briefing note that told her of almost 3,000 inappropriate uses of the TFW program almost a year ago. Yet a few weeks ago ministers and parliamentary secretaries all feigned surprise and said they moved quickly as soon as they found out there was a problem. In the world I live in, over a year or year and a half of waiting does not indicate that they took action quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318362">This bill would also deny due process to refugees, and I want to mention that. There are all kinds of fees that the minister would no longer have to come to the House to put into place. New Democrats have major concerns about the lack of transparency of the usage of those fees.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318380">The success of a nation is due to the manner in which society values its workers, its innovators and the way it allows everyone the opportunity to succeed and improve their lives through hard work and ingenuity. This is supported in a recent book, <I>Why Nations Fail</I>, by Daron Acemoglu from MIT and James Robinson of Harvard University. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318381">
                <I>Why Nations Fail</I> provides a historical study of civilizations that have succeeded and failed and determines that civilizations have fallen or thrived based on, above all else, their political institutions. Governments thrived when they provided the rule of law, secure property rights and a strong independent judiciary. Good government prevents any elite from extracting the wealth out of a country for themselves and spreads opportunity around. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318382">Geography, culture and resources, all gifts that Canada has in abundance, take a back seat to good government that is responsive and accountable to its citizens in this manner. When money can travel over wireless networks in a split second and investors from anywhere in the world can invest anywhere else in the world within a matter of minutes, people will invest in a nation that will secure their investments and grow them with minimal risk. The people of those nations benefit with jobs and opportunities, as Canadians do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318383">Canada's economic action plan for 2013 is part of an economic process. It is in its seventh year. It began in 2006, from our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance </Affiliation>and <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It prioritizes stability, prudent fiscal management and careful stewardship of our economy, something that most of Europe and the U.S. are struggling toward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318384">How is Canada doing? Most Canadians know these facts. Canada has had the most stable and sound financial system in the world for five years straight. Canada is the number one place in the world to do business. Canada has the highest possible credit rating from the three major rating agencies. We are in the best fiscal position of any of the G7 countries. We have the lowest government net debt to GDP ratio in the G7. During the recent recession Canada did not have to bail out a single bank. By 2015 we will have a balanced budget without putting our hands in the pockets of taxpayers and business owners for new taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318385">However, what some members of the House do not understand is that none of this happened by accident. This was achieved by good management and tough decisions. Let me give a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318386">Back in 2006, when the U.S. government allowed risky mortgages that covered the entire value of the house, plus in some cases even the furniture, our government tightened up the mortgage rules, asking for higher credit ratings and stopping the 40-year terms the banks were pitching. This helped save Canada from a U.S.-style housing crisis. Despite our deficit, created to fight the 2008 recession, and the difficult task of limiting spending now to balance our national budget, just last year the NDP and Liberals wanted to send billions of our tax dollars to Europe to bail out governments that have not made the tough decisions we are making. We said, “No way”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318387">We would never consider the NDP plan to grab $60 billion out of the pockets of business owners, shareholders and workers, although personal debt is at an all-time high. Given the chance, that plan would include a death tax on the wealthy, promoted by the NDP academic branch at the Broadbent Institute. Of course, the definition of wealthy would be anyone who had perhaps $50,000 a year after they die, which is about the cost of a parking space at a condo in downtown Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318388">Democracy is sharing power. Sound economics and strong institutions support that sharing and ensure the security of all Canadians, not just the wealthy. That is why those who are not wealthy are often the first to support Conservative budgets. In bad times the wealthy do all right, but those who are not wealthy are at the risk of losing everything. They have the most to lose when governments overspend for decades and go bankrupt. They are the ones who line up at the EI office. A good budget must balance the interests of all citizens, while not confiscating the earnings of entrepreneurs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318389">Where democracies get into financial trouble is when the public sector grows out of control and confiscates more than the private sector can afford to pay. Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> would implement a budget process that would reduce the size and cost of government, to be affordable. The budget would reduce full-time equivalents by attrition and eliminating positions and would reduce spending by another $600 million a year. The budget would be balanced by 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318390">On the other side of the floor, there are a lot of members who believe in their heart of hearts that governments exist to decide who gets what. They want to be the ones who write the rules for everyone else to divvy up the pie. They actually think that governing is like contract bargaining. What they do not understand is where wealth comes from. That is our focus. We cut it down, dig it up, manufacture it, reap it from the soil, add value through trade, and we must do it all better through innovation. The budget would help entrepreneurs and businesses that take risks and innovate to create wealth and new jobs for others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318391">There is something else they do not get. This is a free country, and when taxes get too high people and businesses leave. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318392">I have seen this happen when the NDP, under the leadership of the then member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale, was in power as the NDP premier. The taxes in Ontario became the highest in North America: businesses left in droves; unemployment skyrocketed; government revenues crashed; and government debt more than doubled, from $38 billion to almost $100 billion. Ontario was essentially bankrupt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318393">As Dr. Phil says: “How's that working for them in Europe today?” Well, how about Greece with 27% unemployment, or Cyprus where bank deposits are being confiscated, or Portugal where the unemployment rate has reached 17%? It is no surprise that these countries are not prospering. </ParaText>

This budget is building a foundation and structure for a secure future for our children and grandchildren. It closes tax loopholes for tax fairness and improves the integrity of the tax system. It supports innovation and research, and it is a commitment to Canadians that their economy is on the right track. Its success is founded on two major platforms: the first is paying down the debt on time and without excuses; and the second is strategic investment in growth and innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318396">The year 2013 began with a welcome announcement in my riding of Oakville when our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> visited Canada's largest Ford plant, the Oakville assembly plant, on January 6. The Prime Minister was there to announce an investment of $250 million in the automotive innovation fund to 1,000 CAW folks who build these high-quality low-emission cars. The fund is for auto industry firms undertaking large-scale research and development projects that are focused on innovative, greener and more fuel efficient vehicles. The fund is working. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318397">The money invested in Ford's Windsor engine plant originally created 450 full-time jobs, but since then it has grown to 600 full-time jobs. What is more impressive is that there are 3,000 people working at the Oakville assembly plant who now work full-time as a result of investments made by this government in 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318398">Other projects supported by the AIF include Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada's project green light, which includes the production of the RAV4 electric vehicle at Toyota's plant in Woodstock; Magna International's development of clean vehicle technologies, including energy-efficient components and innovative powertrain parts for next-generation vehicles; and construction of a new Toyota blended assembly line that will permit the simultaneous production of both the current Lexus model and the hybrid model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318399">Perhaps our single biggest problem at this point in our history is addressed in this budget. With hundreds of thousands of Canadians hitting retirement age in the next few years and the emergence of the knowledge economy, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that without action we could have over 500,000 unskilled workers who will not be able to find work by 2016. Without action in this budget, there could be over one million skilled job vacancies by 2016. The former president of Seneca College, Rick Miner, summarizes the problem in the title of his report, “People without Jobs, Jobs without People”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318400">The most significant contribution of this budget is perhaps the creation of the Canada job grant, which could provide $15,000 or more per person, with matching funds to match people with jobs. This fund will help up to 130,000 Canadians with access to training for the jobs that are available. This will be at community colleges, career colleges and trade union training centres.</ParaText>

However, the thing that is missing in this budget is real job creation. When the Conservatives took over in 2006, there were one-quarter million fewer unemployed individuals in Canada than there are today, which speaks to the Conservative's record.

              <ParaText id="3318411">When the Conservatives took over the government reigns, the reality was that they had a huge budget surplus. Even prior to the recession taking place, they turned that surplus into a deficit. They had to be brought kicking and screaming by the Liberal Party, who was the official opposition at the time, to provide an economic action plan to keep people employed in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318412">Now when the government members talk about having a balanced budget, members will notice they refer to 2015-16, which is post the next federal election. The Conservative government has never had a balanced budget in the last 100 years. The member should know that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318413">My question to the member is this. Can he clearly and definitely tell this House when the last time was that the Conservatives, the Progressive Conservatives or the Reform Party in Ottawa have presented a balanced budget to this House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318415">I believe the last time this government balanced the budget was in 2007. However, prior to the recession, which the member might remember started in 2008, this government had a surplus which it reinvested by paying down debt. That is what we promised to do. That is why the voters made us the government. We paid down over $30 billion of debt, which is what we are supposed to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318416">When there is a recession, government money is invested to help people stay working. However, when there is a surplus, the government is supposed to pay down debt. That is acceptable fundamental economics. That is exactly what we did. We will not apologize for lowering taxes on Canadian families and putting more money into their pockets once the budget was balanced.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318417">Mr. Speaker, I am almost sad to get up. I was enjoying the Conservatives and the Liberals going at it on the issue of economics when they should be embracing each other because they both practice the same austerity economics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318418">Before I start on the issue of Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, I do want to wish Marg Reilly a very happy birthday. Marg is a constituent of mine. It is a milestone birthday for her, and she is a person worthy of great celebration. Happy Birthday, Marg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318419">Today we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, the budget implementation act. It is the final of five days of debate on the matter, owing to another Conservative time allocation motion, which is a new record for such motions. I dare suggest that there will be more such motions. There seems to be some kind of narcotic effect to these time allocation motions for those guys. It also, perhaps, is just the arrogance of power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318420">In his defence of the Conservative time allocation motion, the <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> described this legislation as “the blueprint of our government's mandate moving forward”. He “felt” that five days was more than enough time to debate the bill. As it turns out, what we have before us is another omnibus bill. It is certainly shorter than its predecessor, but still it involves amendments to nearly 50 pieces of legislation, and even introduces new legislation. That means that on average we have less than one hour of debate for each legislative change or legislative invention included under the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318421">Who would have imagined that those so-called champions of transparency and accountability, these parliamentary reformers who sit on the government side, would have ever stood in this place to justify such a limited level of scrutiny—on budget implementation, no less—for parliamentarians, much less to justify it on the basis of what they felt was appropriate, that those reformers would privilege their feelings over the traditions, institutions and processes of governing and government in Canada? It is most certainly a form of tyranny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318422">This is not simply an issue of process or principle, as those members like to portray it. This is about a government that is failing to do its best for this country and its citizens, a government that has deliberately set a target below the potential of Canada and its citizens. Never mind excellence, never mind maximization, never mind over-achieving, the Conservative government aspires to under-achievement, to less than what is possible, to less than our potential. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318423">This is the recurring narrative in the April 29 economic and fiscal outlook produced by the Parliamentary Budget Office. I want to quote a bit at length here:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">PBO projects real GDP growth in Canada to slow to 1.5 per cent in 2013 and remain below its potential growth rate until 2015. Combined with the sluggish recovery in the global economy, government spending restraint will act as an additional drag on growth and job creation. The projected weakness in growth keeps the economy well below its potential GDP through 2015 and as a result the unemployment rate remains relatively stable, averaging 7.3 per cent over 2013 to 2015.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3318425">It goes on to talk about employment in Canada being below its potential. That is on page 10, if anybody wants to reference that. It say that employment and “average weekly hours” for Canadian workers are below potential. That is on page 11. “Labour productivity” is below, which is, again, on page 11. Gross domestic product is “below potential”, on page 11 again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318426">How is all of this happening? Quite curiously, it is happening by design. As the economic and fiscal outlook says, “Over the period 2013 to 2017, PBO estimates that the net impact of [economic action plan] 2013 measures and revisions to spending levels on real GDP and employment is contractionary”. It is 67,000 jobs worth of contractionary, according to the report, which is a .57% reduction in GDP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318427">The PBO explains that does not mean that employment levels will be 67,000 jobs shy of where we are today. That is fair enough. The report explains it in these terms:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318432">What is particularly perplexing is that the budget comes in the context of a Canada that is already so far shy of its potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318433">The government has presided over a $67 billion trade deficit that is expected to worsen in the year ahead. That is thousands of jobs and billions of dollars leaving this country and going overseas to enrich others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318434">There are still almost 1.4 million Canadians out of work. There are 240,000 more young people unemployed today than before the recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318435">Closer to my home, in Toronto, in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation>, I would note a recent report by the United Way and McMaster University showing that nearly 50% of jobs in southwestern Ontario are precarious jobs. A recent report by the Metcalf Foundation shows that the number of working poor is growing in the greater Toronto area. Reports by the Cities Centre at the University of Toronto show the continuing income polarization in our cities, particularly in Toronto, and extrapolate current trends to show a city with a completely hollowed-out middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318436">To be fair, this trend has carried through successive Liberal and Conservative governments, so we cannot blame it all on the guys on the other side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318437">The only employment numbers growing by a significant measure are for temporary foreign workers, spurred on by the government's inducement of paying significantly lower wages than for Canadian workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318438">It is in this context that the government sees it wise to hit the brakes on the economy to constrain economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318439">This is a set of circumstances that calls for a different kind of action, action that would put Canadians and Canadian cities, which are after all the engines of economic growth in a modern economy, to work—to begin at long last to undo the constraints on our economy, to realize the potential of our country and to make a more equally shared prosperity a goal for this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318440">Let us look for a moment at the issue of infrastructure. Here is an economic opportunity that the government has failed to grasp.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318441">By many accounts, the infrastructure deficit in this country is well north of $150 billion, and it continues to grow. We need to see this problem addressed, and soon. “A penny now or a dollar later”, as the 2012 Canadian Infrastructure Report Card puts it, meaning the cost of delaying needed repairs could cost us vastly larger sums down the road, yet over the next four years, federal infrastructure funding will be $4.7 billion lower than it was last year, despite some creative advertising by the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318442">This so-called new infrastructure funding announced in budget 2013 includes funding from older, delayed projects. There is $6 billion worth announced in this new economic action plan that is masquerading as new money when it is actually existing funds that had been committed back in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318443">This is a budget that would provide no relief for urban congestion in Canadian cities. Owing to successive uninterested Liberal and Conservative governments, the public transit system in Toronto has not grown in any meaningful way since 1980.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318444">In conclusion, what the government needs to explain to Canadians is how it dares to occupy those benches over there when it puts forward a plan that would shrink this country rather than grow it, when it puts forward a plan that would take jobs from Canadians rather than create jobs for them, when it aspires to less than what we are capable of as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318445"> How does the government explain that to the youth of this country who have their futures in front of them? How does it explain it to the seniors of this country, who left what they had built up in our hands not so that we could take it down, but so that we could continue to build upon it?</ParaText>

They can find nothing right with our budget and nothing right with our budget implementation bill. That is very disturbing, because they are totally out of touch with Canadians. In fact, our budget was extremely well received by Canadians, and our economic action plan has allowed business across this country to create 950,000 new jobs since the recession ended.

              <ParaText id="3318454">In fact, it becomes an extremely important program for a city like Toronto. One of the curious things about the city that I live in, because of its particular built form, is that over 60% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from heating and cooling the built environment, so a program like the eco-energy program became a critical part of dealing with climate change and with greenhouse gas emissions in a city like Toronto. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318455">I know my constituents very much regret the decision of the government to cancel that program, not only because of the improvements it brought to their own properties and because of their concern about the environment but also because of the great job potential that the program had.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318457"> I want to express from the start how disappointed I am that the opposition, for some reason, cannot find something good about our budget and our budget implementation bill when Canadians have really supported our budget with open arms and very positive endorsements from third parties of all types, including business and union leaders and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318458"> However, the opposition members just cannot find it in themselves to say that there is a lot about this budget and this budget implementation bill that is good. That is very disappointing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318459">They also complain about any program that has been ended by the government since we came to office. The reality is that many of these programs were put in place by previous governments to help meet a policy objective of that previous government. In many cases, that policy objective no longer exists, so why should the program continue indefinitely?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318460">One of those programs the opposition is complaining about was actually put in place 100 years ago. To me, the policy objective made a lot of sense 100 years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318461">The program was the shelterbelt program. That was in the last budget, just as an example. That program was put in place almost 100 years ago to help protect our prairie soil from wind and water erosion, and it was a good program at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318462">However, I suppose many members do not recognize that in the 1980s farmers started direct seeding crops, so this erosion that the shelterbelt program was put in place to protect against simply no longer exists because the soil is not tilled as it used to be and we do not have summer fallow as we used to have. The problem that the program was put in place to solve simply does not exist now, yet the opposition members complain about our government ending even this 100-year-old program that no longer meets a policy objective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318463">I am going to guess what they would do, and that would be to just have these programs built one on top of another until we would be so far in debt that we simply could not balance the budget in this country and we ended up in the same kind of mess that our neighbours to the south are in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318464">To me, that is not an acceptable route to take. Our government has committed to balancing the budget by 2015. That is an objective I want to support, even if they do not, and it is an objective that is certainly supported by my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318465">The opposition cannot find a thing right about the policies being implemented in this budget implementation bill. I want to run some examples by the House. It will be kind of a disjointed presentation here dealing with different issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318466">The first issue is the adoption expense tax credit. This was put in place to better recognize that adoptive parents incur costs prior to being matched with a child. A lot of expense goes into that process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318467">I know that some of my colleagues have adopted children, and they understand this issue very well.

              <ParaText id="3318468">My niece and her husband tried to adopt children for 10 years, and they just could not do it. They tried a lot of things to make this happen. They have incurred a lot of expenses. What they wanted was a child; they desperately wanted a child. They commented to me on several occasions that the costs are really incredible and that they would appreciate anything that could be done to help them deal with that a little.</ParaText>

Just a couple of years ago they completed the adoption of their little girl, and currently they have a little boy and are hoping to be able to keep the little boy and adopt him.

They are forced to pay memberships, and the unions decide whether that money goes to a particular political party. I know that the Conservative members get a lot of support from union members, but it does not come through unions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318479">Another thing this budget implementation bill would deal with is the accelerated capital cost allowance for manufacturing processing machinery and equipment. Again, the opposition parties always claim that they are standing up for union members and unions. Yet they cannot find it in their hearts to say that they support that accelerated capital cost allowance, which would encourage manufacturers to expand, build new plants and create new jobs here in Canada. They just cannot find it in their hearts to say that what the government is doing makes a lot of sense, that it is good for their union members and that they are going to support it. They will not do it. They just cannot be anything but negative. That is what I have heard from the NDP: negative, negative, negative. I get tired of it day after day. It is the same with the Liberals, those of them who are, in fact, here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318480">Another issue is the additional deduction for credit unions. I have heard one particular member in the Liberal Party, who is a big supporter of co-ops. Lots of members in our caucus are big supporters of co-ops. Probably even some New Democrats are big supporters of co-ops. We hear our members talking about the positive aspects of the additional deduction for credit unions in this budget implementation act. Credit unions, of course, already qualify for the Canadian preferential income tax rate on the first $500,000 per year of qualifying business income. This would go beyond that, for credit unions in particular. The members claim to be big supporters of co-ops, but what do we hear from them on that issue here in the House of Commons? They are nothing but negative. They cannot find it in their hearts to say that carrying on that credit union special tax exemption is something they can support, because it is good for co-ops, good for their union members and good for the country. They just will not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318481">I just got started. There is a long list of items we would implement in this budget implementation bill that I know their constituents support. Their constituents support it, yet the opposition members cannot find it in their hearts to support their constituents. If they cannot support government or the good things we are doing, at least they should support their constituents. They are not doing that. They are failing them, and they should be ashamed. I encourage them to change their direction and start supporting the good things the government is doing.</ParaText>

They implement a budget, which is an omnibus bill. I do not think there is any other way of doing it realistically.

              <ParaText id="3318493">The new leader of the Liberal Party knows nothing about the middle class. He does not know what it is like to lose his job or to have to wait for employment insurance benefits. He does not know the problems that come with receiving an unexpected bill. He cannot understand the difficulties the middle class experiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318494">As with the last two budget implementation bills, the NDP opposes Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> for its content and for the process. I will use my time to explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318495">The austerity measures of the past few years, both in North America and in Europe, have not produced the desired economic results, to say the least. Just recently, the staunchest supporters of austerity measures had to acknowledge two mistakes that had been made. Our Conservative friends do not seem to be aware of them or do not understand their implications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318496">Last October, the International Monetary Fund—the IMF—acknowledged that it had made a calculation error in assessing the impact of those austerity measures, particularly in the southern European countries. What was the error? Simply that it used a fiscal multiplier estimated at a 0.5% drop in GDP. This was seriously underestimated, not a little, but a lot: nearly three times that ratio. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318497"> What the IMF is admitting is that the negative factor was not 0.5, it was actually between 0.9 and 1.7. In simple terms, that means that a one-point cutback in public spending did not result in just a 0.5-point drop in GDP, but a drop of between 0.9 and 1.7 points. Understandably, that revelation has caused considerable discomfort in Europe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318498"> There is every reason to think that the real reason for that discomfort is ideological. Yes indeed. Greece was used as a testing ground out of which only one of the two theories of the cosmos would emerge victorious: Keynesian interventionism versus the liberalism of Friedman, which, like our colleagues opposite, hopes to see the state disappear, or at least be reduced to a minimum. The mastermind behind this operation knew all along that it would lead to the irrevocable and permanent disappearance of Keynes’s legacy, since it would prove that austerity and nothing but austerity would lead to growth. Small mistake. It is exactly that belief that is shared by our ideologue colleagues opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318499"> The IMF experiment turned into a fiasco, a huge fiasco. In Europe, it is responsible for 4,000 suicides, the impoverishment of 3.5 million people and a two-year drop in life expectancy. It is also responsible for an unemployment rate that is beyond comprehension, an explosion in the number of elective abortions, abandoned infants, the dismantling of human lives and families, homeless people in numbers that are out of control, because of the ongoing destruction of the middle class—yes, that is right, we are talking about the middle class—and the intolerable spectacle of Greeks, in the 21st century, hunting through garbage to find something to eat. Those are the horrors of austerity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318500"> Europe seems to be suffering the terrible consequences of a mistaken estimate, in view of the negative growth rates, approaching zero, experienced in recent years and exploding debt followed by unemployment rates that just keep going up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318501"> The International Monetary Fund’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, has in fact said that economic activity is so weak in Europe that all governments that are still able should do nothing that risks shrinking their social safety net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318502"> Is a shrinking social safety net not what we are seeing in Canada with the planned cuts to employment insurance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318503">I would like to talk about the second economic error that was recently acknowledged by staunch supporters of austerity measures. Reinhart and Rogoff, two economists at Harvard University, asserted that a country's economic growth slowed when its debt exceeded 80% of GDP. The Conservatives, who abhor deficits, are panicking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318504">This false economic assumption was used by far too many supporters of fiscal restraint. Numerous countries relied on this study, which was exploited for political purposes, and took the same stance on fiscal restraint, with serious consequences: civil servants' salaries were frozen, there was structural reform, taxes were raised and so on. That is exactly what the Conservatives are proposing with Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318505">On April 17, the attention of economists around the world was focused on a discovery made by Thomas Herndon, a young economist at the University of Massachusetts. With the help of his professors, he recalculated the famous Rogoff and Reinhart numbers. They realized that when debt exceeded 90% of GDP, average growth was not -0.1%, it was 2%. The reason for this difference is that Rogoff and Reinhart do not seem to have included a number of countries in their calculations. They excluded Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Belgium between 1946 and 1950. Their calculations were inaccurate, and the premise that growth stagnates when debt exceeds 90% of GDP is false. Herndon's study proves that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318506"> What does all that mean for Canada? Despite these proven errors, despite the warnings of the International Monetary Fund and the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the Conservative government is sticking to austerity measures by introducing Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>. In a 32-page paper published by his office, the Parliamentary Budget Officer calculated that the Conservative government's 2013 budget will have a net negative impact on the labour market over three years. Employment will fall by 8,000 jobs in 2015, 14,000 in 2016 and 10,000 in 2017. The net impact of the budget-cutting measures that the Conservative government has taken since 2012 will amount to a loss of more than 67,000 jobs in 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318507"> The Conservatives, who like to boast of their job creation record, are living in an ideological bubble. In the meantime, 1.5 million Canadians are out of work and we now have 240,000 more unemployed youth than before the recession. Despite that fact, the only measure in Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> that will create jobs is the addition of new cabinet ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318508"> The Parliamentary Budget Officer has clearly stated that the Conservatives' savage cuts announced in budget 2013 are not necessary to restore a structural budget surplus. On the contrary, combined with the anemic global economic recovery, the austerity measures imposed by the Harper government will further slow economic growth and job creation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3318529">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, the first budget implementation act of 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318530">Economic action plan 2013 is an outstanding budget that responds to the needs of Canadians. It delivers on the priorities that matter to my constituents in Richmond Hill: jobs, a stable economy, low taxes, support for infrastructure, help for the most vulnerable, and investments in science and innovation to build the jobs of the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318531">In my time allowed today I will highlight just a few of the ways in which economic action plan 2013 would benefit communities, families and job creators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318532">During my pre-budget consultations in Richmond Hill, I heard loud and clear from many constituents, local businesses, the Richmond Hill Chamber of Commerce and many others about how essential the gas tax fund has become. It is a source of predictable, stable, long-term funding to municipalities that helps build and revitalize public infrastructure while achieving positive environmental results. This Conservative government under the leadership of the right hon. <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> doubled the gas tax fund in 2009. It was also this government that put legislation in place through economic action plan 2011 to make these funds permanent. This is not a small amount. The gas tax fund is a direct annual investment of $2 billion delivered directly to municipalities across our great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318533">In my riding, the town of Richmond Hill, this important government initiative adds $5 million each and every year to its coffers. Since we doubled the fund in 2009 that means about $20 million has helped build essential infrastructure in the town of Richmond Hill. Let me give the House a few examples: $435,000 in gas tax funds provided the energy-efficient upgrades for our rehabilitated Bond Lake Arena in addition to federal recreational infrastructure contributions of $712,000, which allowed residents in Oak Ridges and the surrounding area to continue using this important community facility; $200,000 in gas tax funds was used to install a geothermal heating and cooling system at the Richmond Hill Theatre for the Performing Arts, saving thousands of dollars in operating costs; and $1.1 million in gas tax funds went toward the rehabilitation of the aging Pioneer Park stormwater facility. Approximately 700 hectares of land, including many new neighbourhoods, are now protected from erosion and flooding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318534">Millions of dollars have been used to support a collection of energy-efficient projects. These include: a solar heating and snow melting system at the Shaw House in Phyllis Rawlinson Park; a solar pool heating system at Bayview Hill Community Centre; a small wind turbine and solar electrical panels at Richmond Green Park, and the purchase of a fully electric vehicle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318535">Gas tax funds in Richmond Hill helped the community achieve the honour of being Ontario's first municipality to reach its corporate greenhouse gas reduction target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318536">Economic action plan 2013 goes even further by proposing to index gas tax funds at 2% per year. It also expands the list of eligible projects to include highways, short-line rail, disaster mitigation, broadband and connectivity activity, brownfield redevelopment, culture, tourism, sport and recreation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318537">Our government supports infrastructure renewal. It creates jobs and is the fundamental underpinning of healthy communities. I am proud that economic action plan 2013 includes the historic building Canada plan, the largest long-term federal commitment to infrastructure in our nation's history. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318538">The plan allocates $53.5 billion over the next 10 years for provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318539"> In addition to the gas tax funds, building Canada includes a community improvement fund, which would provide $32 billion to municipalities, over and above what they now receive, for projects such as roads, public transit and recreational facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318540">A new building Canada fund would provide $14 billion to support major projects across the country, and $1.25 billion would support innovative ways to build infrastructure projects faster and at good value for Canadians through a renewed P3 Canada fund. An additional $6 billion would be provided to provinces, territories and municipalities under the current infrastructure programs in 2014, 2015 and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318541">Our government is committed to helping Canadian manufacturers better compete in the global economy. That is why we have established the lowest tax burden on new business investment in the G7. Economic action plan 2013 would add to this. The temporary accelerated capital cost allowance rate for qualifying assets has been extended. Canadian manufacturers would receive an additional $1.4 billion in tax relief when investing in new machinery and equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318542">We are also supporting our manufacturers by modernizing Canada's general preferential tariff regime for developing countries. Since 1974, Canada has granted preferential market access to imports from developing countries as a way to help those countries develop and grow economically. However, after nearly 40 years, the global economic landscape has changed considerably. Significant economic advancement has been made by some of these developing countries. In response, last year our government undertook a comprehensive review of the preferential tariff regime, including a thorough public consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318543">Economic action plan 2013 acts on the results of these consultations and effective January 1, 2015, benefits would be removed from 72 higher income and export-competitive economies. We think it is time that certain nations that have done well in developing their economies over the years compete with Canadian manufacturers on a more even footing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318544">At the same time, effective on April 1 this year, $79 million in annual tariff relief on imported baby clothing and certain sports equipment was enacted. Consumers and families will see lower prices for these items.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318545">Economic action plan 2013 supports the long-term competitiveness of industries in southern Ontario. It proposes almost $1 billion over five years to renew the Federal Economic Development Agency for southern Ontario. Let me give an example of how important this initiative is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318546">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170529" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation>, FedDev Ontario helped diversify our industrial base with assistance to leading-edge technology companies. One such company was Qvella Corporation. That crucial injection of capital helped develop and bring to market that company's groundbreaking bacteria identification system. The result was a faster diagnosis of bacterial infections in patients and more high-quality jobs for Richmond Hill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318547">The renewal of FedDev Ontario will help many more entrepreneurial businesses like Qvella to create jobs and contribute to economic growth. I am very pleased to see its proposed renewal in economic action plan 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318548">I will close by saying that balancing the books is important to my constituents. Upon assuming office in 2006, our Conservative government, under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, undertook an aggressive plan to pay down the debt. We are working toward that, to balance the budget by 2015-16.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318549">I encourage all members in this House to join me in supporting the swift passage of Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> as it will assist Canadian families immediately.</ParaText>

Our government has cut taxes for Canadians 150 times. That has put $3,200 each and every year in the pockets of Canadian families. We have reduced the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%.

The fact of the matter is that in this budget there is a $550 million tax on small business. There is a $600 million payroll tax, and those taxes would be annual. However, the member talked about the reductions in the tariffs that would make hockey equipment and a few other items cheaper. He failed to mention the fact that the tariff changes on many products that come into this country would be changed to the extent that it would take $338 million out of ordinary Canadians' pockets. That comes right out of these pockets right here. They are empty now, and the Conservative government would be taxing middle-class Canadians even further. Why does he fail to mention that $338 million tax increase on those products, and how can he support this bill with this attack on the middle class?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318560">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> today. I have a very difficult time supporting the bill for a wide variety of excellent reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318561">One of the things I have noted about the government, more so than any other government I have had the opportunity to serve in opposition to over the last 20-plus years, is that this government sees the value of political spin like no other. It has no hesitation whatsoever in using taxpayer dollars to get that spin out there. We see that with member after member on the government benches talking from the speaking notes of the Prime Minister's Office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318562">Listening to some of the speeches, I often wonder if it could have been a speech from the opposition benches, which could have been used against the government, especially when it starts to talk about being financially responsible, because this has not been a government that has been financially responsible with taxpayers' dollars. A good example of that, and tying into the spin, is the economic action plan. I would classify it as a dud, and I have had the opportunity to do that before. It just does not have the impact that the Government of Canada should have, given the millions and billions of dollars that are being spent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318563">If we were to canvas Canadians I think we would find that they are starting to get a little upset with the government and the amount of tax dollars it is spending promoting the budget. The number of commercials is unbelievable. Whether on NHL playoffs or whatever, the commercials are there. In print and on television, the government has a message and it wants to sell that message. It will not spare a dime of taxpayer dollars doing that. Whatever it takes, it is prepared to saturate with that message. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318564">What I would like to do is just focus a little attention on the bigger picture, the reality of the Conservative-Reform government that Canadians have had to witness over the last number of years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318565">Let us look at many of the speeches in which the Conservatives talk about the banking industry. They love to assume the credit for the banking industry and how solid the Canadian banks are today. Not only do they crow inside the House; they do it outside the House and even internationally. The reality is that it was Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, as the minister of finance, who resisted the changes that were taking place around the world regarding deregulating the banking industry and allowing banks to merge and become even larger. It was the government during the 90s that ensured we have one of the best banking industry today, and many would argue that it is the best. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318566">It had nothing to do with this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He cannot take any credit. One of his actions was that his government went ahead and increased mortgages from 25 years to 40 years. Of course, it flip-flopped on that one after it realized it had made a mistake. The Conservatives have not done anything really to solidify the banking industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318567">Let us look at the credit that would be taken away from our credit unions. For many of these credit unions, which provide competition to our banks and provide excellent consumer services, particularly in our rural regions from coast to coast to coast, millions of dollars would be taken away in the form of tax credits and so forth. Those have gone a long way in the survival of our credit unions, allowing them to grow and provide that competition. In Winnipeg's north end, we have only had a credit union, and it has actually expanded. That has been the impact they have had on that particular industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318568">If we talk about budget surpluses and deficits, historically, Conservatives have not done well in terms of having surplus budgets. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318569">We know that for a fact. The reality with this particular government is that when it took office, it inherited a multi-billion dollar surplus. Before the recession even took place, it turned that surplus into a deficit situation. The Conservative government has presented a deficit ever since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318570">The government knows that Canadians recognize that at times the books have to be balanced. What does the government say? It says that it is going to balance them in 2015-16. That is after the next federal election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318571">Why should we believe that? Why should Canadians believe that Conservatives even have the ability to balance the books when they have been such a disaster in terms of their predictions in dealing with balancing the books. They have failed miserably. They inherited this wonderful trade surplus, which brought in hundreds of millions of additional dollars to Canada and which created tens of thousands of jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318572">That surplus turned into a multi-billion deficit. That is the record of this particular Conservative-Reform government we have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318573">Speaker after speaker likes to get up and talk about taxes. They like to give the impression that the Conservatives know how to give tax breaks. In the last three or four year, in the last three or four budgets that have been presented by the government, we have actually seen net tax increases, each one tens of millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318574">This is not a government that is friendly to the taxpayer or, in particular, to the middle class of Canada. Some of the taxes that the Conservatives have put into place make us want to give our head a shake and wonder where the compassion is. We have raised these issues in question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318575">Imagine now that people want to go to a hospital and visit someone. The government came up with an interesting tax; it is going to tax parking at the parkade or at the meters. We have a new parking tax that is being implemented by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318576">What about victims of crime who require certain medical tests that might be necessary or that would provide peace of mind, if in fact they were able to get the medical tests that they believe are necessary for them? We are talking about victims of crime. The government has found a new way of taxing those victims of crime, for mental services, as an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318577">The Conservatives have well over 1,000 new tariff increases. The bottom line is that they can talk all they want; they can say that they are going to cut taxes or that their government believes in cutting taxes, but in reality that is just not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318578">There have been net tax increases in the last four budgets. The middle class is being hit hard by the government. People who are 35 to 55, who have a quality job but find themselves unemployed for whatever reason, have to try to find employment, which is hard for this age group, especially if it comes to trying to get a job of some sort of equivalent pay to what they were receiving before. What in this budget allows those individuals to feel optimistic?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318579"> We can kind of get a sense of the mentality of the government towards labour by looking at the temporary foreign worker program, a program that traditionally has been exceptionally successful, under Liberal administrations, and that has derived many benefits for all residents of Canada. It illustrates the need and the way in which the government has made a mess of things.</ParaText>

Is he saying that these private corporations should continue to receive that kind of subsidy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318584">The member also talked about deficits and the need to bring the deficit down. I agree.

              <ParaText id="3318587">That is just one example. If we add up all the tax increases, we will find that there is a net tax increase. When the Conservatives decrease a tax, they spend millions of public tax dollars on ads to promote the tax cuts.

              <ParaText id="3318589">I would like to hear from the member about the myth the government is propagating that if we do not increase tariffs, we will be flooded with foreign products and that we have to increase those tariffs, because countries like China no longer need protection. That might be the case if we were producing those products here in Canada, but we are not. Those products will still come in, but those prices will go up. I wonder if the member could speak about that fact.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="170469" Type="2">Mr. Guy Lauzon (Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3318593">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in the House today to speak to the budget implementation act. Since the depths of the recession in July 2009, our Conservative government has created 900,000 net new jobs, and this was due to our economic action plan. Economic action plan 2013 would build on this strong economic foundation by creating even more jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318594">Every year leading up to the budget, I undertake extensive pre-budget consultations with my constituents right across my riding of Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry. This year, I received overwhelming feedback from my constituents that they want a budget focused on job creation, economic growth and a return to balanced budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318595">There is an old saying that if we want to know where people are going, we should look at where they have been. I believe that applies to governments as well, so let us take a look at where we have been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318596">Since 2006, we have cut taxes 150 times, reducing the overall tax burden to its lowest level in over 50 years. We have cut taxes in every way governments collect them: personal income taxes, consumption taxes, business and corporate taxes, excise taxes and much more. In fact, our strong record of tax relief has meant savings for a typical family of four in 2013 of over $3,200. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318597">Economic action plan 2013 would build on these tax reductions. Economic action plan 2013 would eliminate tariffs on baby clothing, sporting goods and athletic equipment. In total, this represents $76 million in savings for Canadian taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318598">Our government also introduced a new temporary first-time donor's super credit for first-time claimants of the charitable donations tax credit. It would encourage all young Canadians to follow in the footsteps of their fathers and mothers and donate to charity. To encourage charitable giving by new donors, this measure would provide an additional 25% tax credit for a first-time donor on up to $1,000 in monetary donations. I see this being a big hit in Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, because it is already known as one of the most charitable ridings in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318599">Our government will also improve benefits for Canadian veterans through changes to the war veterans allowance, which would result in over 3,100 veterans being eligible for this allowance for the very first time. In addition, an estimated 5,350 veterans and survivors would benefit from the change. The war veterans allowance program provides assistance to low-income veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War as well as their survivors. Eligibility for the program and the range of benefits provided depends, of course, on a recipient's income. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318600">Under the terms of eligibility for the current program, a veteran's total calculated income includes the disability pension provided by Veterans Affairs Canada. To better assist veterans who have served their country, our government, as a result of proposed amendments to the Pension Act and the War Veterans Allowance Act, will no longer take the disability pension into account when determining eligibility and in calculating the benefits provided under the war veterans allowance. Our veterans, especially veterans in Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, will really appreciate this benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318601">Economic action plan 2013 would also support high-quality, value-added jobs in important sectors of the Canadian economy, such as manufacturing, through tax relief for new investment in manufacturing equipment. To support new investment in machinery and equipment in the manufacturing and processing sectors, this measure would extend the temporary accelerated capital allowance rate for machinery and equipment acquired by a taxpayer, primarily for use in Canada, for the manufacturing or processing of goods for sale or lease. Extending the accelerated capital cost allowance for only two years would increase support for manufacturers by almost $1.4 billion and would create tens of thousands of jobs for hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3318602">Economic action plan 2013 would also provide better support for job-creating infrastructure in municipalities across Canada by indexing the gas tax fund. That would be $32.2 billion over 10 years through gas tax fund payments and the incremental GST rebate for municipalities. It would provide stable and predictable funding to support community infrastructure projects that will improve the quality of life for all Canadian families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318603">We have six municipalities in Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, and all six mayors and councils are singing our praises for the gas tax fund and for indexing it and making it permanent. I have a couple of mayors of the Liberal persuasion, and even they are singing our praises. That shows how popular this is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318604">As members know, our seniors built this wonderful country we call Canada. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude. Our government is committed to helping ensure that Canadian seniors receive the compassionate care they need and deserve. The Pallium Foundation of Canada works to improve the quality of palliative end-of-life care for Canadians by creating educational resources for primary care professionals. Economic action plan 2013 proposes funding of $3 million to support training in palliative care for front-line health care providers. This investment would build on the funding provided in budget 2011 being used to support the initiative called the way forward: moving toward community-integrated hospital palliative care in Canada, which aims to help develop new community-integrated palliative care models right across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318605">Economic action plan 2013 would also reform the temporary foreign worker program to ensure that Canadians are given the first chance at available jobs. To strengthen and improve the temporary foreign worker program, the government is introducing legislation and regulatory and administrative changes that would be effective immediately. They would temporarily suspend the accelerated labour market opinion process; would seek to increase the government's authority to suspend and revoke work permits and labour market opinions if the program was misused; would seek to introduce fees for employers for processing labour market opinions; and would increase the fees for work permits so that taxpayers would no longer be subsidizing the cost. These changes would strengthen and improve the temporary foreign worker program to support our economic recovery and growth and would ensure that more employers hire Canadians before hiring temporary foreign workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318606">As members can see, we are building on our successes of the past seven years to make Canada an even better place to live, work and play. Is it not a shame that the two opposition parties will not join in this wonderful, great success story? We are going to do all this, and we are going to eliminate the deficit. What a <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> we have, and we cannot get the support of the people across the way to encourage this finance minister to slay this deficit. I cannot for the life of me understand why our worthy colleagues on the opposite side of the House will not join us and celebrate this wonderful economic action plan 2013.</ParaText>

Following our last review in 2009, Canada pledged to consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. Yet, here we are four years later, and the Conservative government is still considering this very serious matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318663">What this optional protocol does is to establish an international inspection system for persons in jails that is modelled after the European system that has been in place since 1987. In the current report, our allies, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands, recommend that Canada join the civilized world and ratify this convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318664">Considering that OPCAT was adopted by the UN in 2002, this means that Canada has had 11 long years, with first the Liberal government and now the Conservative government, to consider ratifying it.</ParaText>

Conservatives launched make-believe attacks on the opposition to distract from their mismanagement of Veterans Affairs. Conservatives dragged disabled veterans through the courts over pension clawbacks. They made the appeals process for benefits a nightmare. They shortchanged the last post fund to the point of embarrassment; and then there are the Conservative privacy violations: Sean Bruyea, Sylvain Chartrand and so many others had their most private information callously breached.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318887">The measures set out in Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> concerning the CBC could not have come with more ironic timing. Last Friday was World Press Freedom Day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318888">Throughout the world, May 3 serves as a reminder of the important role a pluralistic, free, independent press plays in a democracy. However, this year also marked Canada's drop in the world press freedom index rankings. Last year, Reporters Without Borders, a respected organization, ranked us 10th. This year, Canada is ranked 20th, behind Costa Rica, Namibia, Andorra and Liechtenstein. We fell 10 spots in one year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318889">Reporters Without Borders mentions a number of factors to explain this astonishing drop. It noted the Government of Canada's actions, specifically the threats to the confidentiality of journalists’ sources. Take note, members opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318890">The government finds itself in a serious and surprising situation. This is another brick in the wall of shame that is actively being built here in Ottawa. Our international reputation is all but destroyed. Do I need to point that out? Moreover, the government is steadily attacking the CBC day after day, which is only making matters worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318891">Those attacks continue with Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, which allows the government to have a say in employees' working conditions and certain journalists' salaries. That is a shocking infringement on the public broadcaster's independence. It is clear that Bill C-60 challenges the CBC's independence, particularly its journalistic and editorial independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318892">Canadians across the country have been writing to us—to me and my colleagues—for days to express their dismay and anger over the government's attempt to hijack management of the CBC. The CBC has been at arm's length from the government for nearly 80 years; it is a democratic tradition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318893"> Liberal and Conservative prime ministers have done what they had to do throughout that time; that is, a number of governments from both parties have taken the opportunity to cut the CBC’s budget, but they all have chosen to respect the independence of the public broadcaster. Governments come and go, but they do not meddle with the independence of the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318894"> Today, it is clear that it is not very difficult to tear that down. It takes an insidious bill, a bill like this one, that gives the government the right to impose collective agreements, to decide the terms of employment for non-unionized employees and the salaries of journalists, bureau chiefs and news anchors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318895"> To date, every government had restrained itself and chosen to respect a broadcaster funded by taxpayers, yes, but accountable not to the government, but directly to the public. It is that very restraint that characterizes the conduct of democratic governments toward the public broadcasters they fund. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318896">Over the last few days, hundreds of Canadians have written to me as heritage critic for the official opposition and to my colleagues. I am sure that members in the government benches across the floor have also received a lot of emails about this. Canadians are angry about this attempt to threaten the independence of the CBC. Canadians are angry about the government's attempt to end 80 years of independent public broadcasting in this country, free from interference from the government.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3318897">I have the feeling that people are frankly outraged that the government would dare to meddle with what is actually a democratic tradition in Canada: the healthy distance between government and public broadcaster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318898"> It is that distance that means that a CBC journalist can report that $3.1 billion simply disappeared from the government’s books and still know that his employer will not be asking him to tone it down in the next report because the minister is twisting its arm. It is that distance that means that a news anchor can decide that such information deserves to be given to Canadians, without having to worry that the government thus tarnished might decide to interfere in his next employment contract. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318899"> We see that the government wants to apply the same medicine to other cultural crown corporations like the National Arts Centre, Telefilm Canada and the Canada Council for the Arts. The cultural community is speaking out against this. The Independent Media Arts Alliance, in particular, has denounced the threat to the statutory independence of the Canada Council for the Arts. In a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>, the alliance states that doing this is harmful to the spirit and principle of a crown corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318900"> I note that these principles of independence are laid out by the Canada Council for the Arts. In its fundamental values, it states that it maintains “an arm’s length relationship from government, which allows the Council to develop policies and programs and make decisions without undue political pressure or influence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318901"> The Canada Council also supports “freedom of artistic expression from control or dominance by external forces such as governments and markets”, a value to be reinforced by the arm’s length relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318902"> We know that these measures will have a negative effect on the delivery of the services provided by these cultural agencies and their ability to attract personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318903"> Obviously, the Conservatives’ goal is to diminish the independence of these public institutions, which play important roles for creators in particular. The Conservatives seem to be exhibiting a complete lack of interest in the very concept of an independent crown corporation: the space there has to be between government, politics and crown corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318904"> The leader of our party, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170208" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation>, summarized the problem well yesterday afternoon. When it comes to advancing its ideological agenda, the government is not the least bit bothered about interfering with independent crown corporations. For example, it tells them how to manage their employees, how to administer collective agreements, what salaries are appropriate and how many pencil sharpeners and paper clips they should buy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318905"> However, when a problem arises in those crown corporations, the government waves the white flag and says it has nothing to do with them. When a crown corporation makes a mistake or its managers do something wrong, all of a sudden the government cannot do anything. They are independent crown corporations. That is very handy. Suddenly, the statutory independence and arm’s length status of crown corporations is back in fashion, according to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318906"> But it gets worse. As members undoubtedly know, Library and Archives Canada is our national archives. It is an institution that is the guardian of our most precious historical documents and even a few artifacts from the War of 1812—for the pleasure of Library and Archives Canada. However, things are not going well over there. In the opinion of the archivists, librarians, archaeologists, historians and numerous professions that have previously been represented at Library and Archives Canada, things are even going very badly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318907"> Acquisitions of historical documents have virtually come to a halt. There has been a full stop in document lending to other libraries, researchers and historians not based in the national capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318908"> Let us talk about this code of conduct imposed on the employees, professionals, experts and scientists at Library and Archives Canada, prohibiting them from attending conferences without authorization, one of several faux pas—including the one we talked about earlier—of a public institution out of control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318909"> When we went to see the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Heritage</Affiliation>, who incidentally seemed embarrassed, and we asked him whether he was going to intervene and whether he thought, as we did, that all this was going too far, he dared answer us that Library and Archives Canada is an independent crown corporation. That is what he said in the House and subsequently in <I>Le Devoir</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318910"> Once again, if a problem arises that makes them uncomfortable, they quickly hit the panic button and say it is not their fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318911"> In this case, however, the minister is on the wrong track because Library and Archives Canada is not at all an independent crown corporation. Not at all. According to its mandate, it is part of the federal government under the administration of the Minister of Heritage. There is nothing less independent than that, unless the minister himself fills the coffee machine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318912"> It seems difficult for this government to grasp the concepts of crown corporation, independence from government, arm's length and independence. They seem subtle. These crown corporations are independent. This is not complicated. For better or for worse, whether or not it pleases the government, they are constituted as entities independent of the government, in the public interest, because they must have some distance from political power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318913"> As for the government, the Conservative Party may make a show of many principles, but I would like it to show a little consistency. Are crown corporations independent or not? They will have to make a choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318914"> In conclusion, apart from this budget that hurts the Canadian economy, apart from these same old solutions, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer has shown, these same old austerity measures that will slow growth and cost thousands of jobs, apart from this economic shambles and lack of vision, hundreds of people have written to us because they are concerned about the independence of their public broadcaster, the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318915"> Ian Morrison, the spokesman for Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, recalled that the difference between a public broadcaster and a state broadcaster lies in its distance from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318916"> In addition, tens of thousands of signatories to petitions, including that of friends.ca, have reaffirmed their support for the independence of the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318917"> CBC management clearly questions the relevance of this government initiative. It states that its employees are neither public servants nor servants of Her Majesty, and it says it needs flexibility so that it can attract the necessary talent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318918">CBC unions have denounced the attack on free collective bargaining and the fact that the government is taking control, violating the Telecommunications Act and giving itself the right to intervene in the CBC's production operations, finances and day-to-day business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318919">Like many other crown corporations, in particular cultural ones, the CBC must remain free of political interference. Public broadcasting, by its very nature, means that the broadcaster represents and speaks on behalf of our culture, not the government.</ParaText>

With an uncertain global economy, we remain focused on ensuring Canada offers the right environment to attract the business investment necessary to create more and better-paying jobs, improving the standard of living of all Canadians.

              <ParaText id="3318955">Contrary to what the official opposition may believe, our economic policies to date, epitomized through Canada’s economic action plan, have worked and placed Canada on the right track.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3318956">Margaret Thatcher once said, “Plan your work for today and every day, then work your plan.” Our government's plan has provided Canada with competitive advantage for today, an advantage on which we will capitalize to ensure prosperity for tomorrow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318957">The facts speak for themselves. Since taking office in 2006, our government has pursued a positive agenda to make Canada's economy stronger, thus helping to create better, high-quality jobs. This has included lowering taxes over 150 times, supporting entrepreneurs and opening more markets to Canadian goods with increased trade deals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318958">Canada has more than recovered all of its output as well as all of the jobs lost during the recession. In fact, since July 2009, employment has increased by almost 900,000 net new jobs, the strongest job growth among the G7 countries over the recovery. Real GDP is now significantly above pre-recession levels, showing the best performance in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318959">While it is gratifying to highlight Canada's economic strengths, we also know we cannot afford to be complacent. Today's advantages will not carry forward into tomorrow simply by good luck or good intentions. This is especially true in an all too volatile global economy. Though coming from beyond our borders, a number of external threats have had, and can have, severe consequences on the Canadian economy. Members can rest assured that the government is cognizant of these challenges and will remain focused and disciplined on the things that we can control. That is why economic action plan 2013 sets out a low-tax plan to eliminate the deficit and return to balanced budgets by 2015-16.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318960"> Economic action plan 2013 sets out a plan that I know my riding of Simcoe—Grey would benefit from this year and for years to come. Let me highlight some of its key components.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318961">Canadians count on good, reliable, lasting infrastructure. It is important to our quality of life and strengthens our communities. That is why our government launched the building Canada plan in 2007, the largest federal infrastructure plan in our nation's history. In fact, over the last six years the federal government has supported over 43,000 infrastructure projects across the country, and this year we are going even further. We will be moving forward with a new building Canada plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318962">One key component of that plan is an indexed gas tax fund payment. The economic action plan would allow for increases to the payments made under the fund starting in 2014-15. Payments are currently $2 billion per year; this index would see the sum increase by $100 million increments year over year. In Simcoe—Grey, municipalities would benefit immensely from this, with upgraded roads, bridges and rail.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3318963">As mentioned, this is only one component of our government’s plan to provide over $70 billion in predictable infrastructure funding for the next 10 years—the largest and longest federal investment in job-creating infrastructure in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3318964">The reality is that whether it is building better roads to reduce congestion and keep people and goods moving or building bridges that link us to each other, infrastructure is key to our nation's success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318965">The economy and job creation remain job number one for our Conservative government. While Canada is on the right track, today there are Canadians seeking work while Canadian businesses are looking to hire skilled workers. The Canada job grant, which is part of economic action plan 2013, is our government's newest measure to bring employers and Canadians together. Through the Canada job grant, funds from the federal government would be matched by both provinces and territories as well as employers to help ensure that Canadians get the skills required for the high-demand jobs of today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318966">This initiative would allow both small and large companies, such as Honda in Alliston, Munro in Essa, Creemore Springs in Creemore, Sheldon Creek Dairy in Loretto, and Hamilton Bros. in Glen Huron, to ensure that their employees have the skills they need to succeed. A shortage of skilled tradespeople could hold Canada's economy back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318967">With a demand for skilled workers to maintain economic growth and with Canadians still looking for work across the country, this is a priority for our Conservative government. It is taking action to help ensure that Canadians are connected to jobs and the economy so that we have the skilled tradespeople we require for economic growth and long-term prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318968">As members know, there have been growing concerns regarding decreased water levels in the Canadian Great Lakes, in particular in my riding of Simcoe—Grey with Georgian Bay, which is bordered by the towns of Blue Mountain, Collingwood and Wasaga Beach.</ParaText>

Our government is working diligently to review the findings and recommendations of the International Joint Commission's work on water levels to make sure that the upper Great Lakes are a focus and have been a focus of this government so that all Canadians can enjoy this region of the country for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318971">Farm families are also the backbone of our country, as they are in my riding of Simcoe—Grey, whether potato growers or apple growers. This is why our Conservative government has delivered support to farmers and the agricultural sector since 2006. We have invested in Growing Forward 2, which supports innovation, competitiveness and market development for Canada's agriculture sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318972">As part of economic action plan 2013, we are delivering on a number of new measures to support Canadian farmers, including increasing and indexing the lifetime capital gains exemption to $800,000, thus making it easier for farmers to plan for their retirement and transfer their family farms to the next generation, which is something I hear about every day in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318973">We are also helping part-time farmers by doubling the current deduction limit under the restricted farm loss income tax rates from $9,750 to $17,000.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3318997">Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. Budgets are about choices. They are also about influence. The Conservatives have made their choices and they have made them on the basis of their ideology and on those lobbyists who are closest to the PMO. Let us be clear: those lobbyists are the largest and wealthiest corporations and CEOs of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318998"> But I will admit their ideology rests on a theory, a theory much flaunted by them, that of the Chicago School of Business, that of Friedman and Hayek, what has been called anarcho-capitalism. These academics created a vision for a utopian capitalist society where the role of the state was limited to ensuring the protection of its citizens. The reality is that most of the members in leadership positions on that side do not really believe in the Canadian state. They want to minimize its democratic influence on the economy and that means austerity wherever it can be had. Do not get me wrong, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his lieutenants are incrementalists to their own admission, so they are in it for the long haul, knowing that they are confronted with the fact that the vast majority of Canadians in their heart of hearts fundamentally disagree with their dog-eat-dog philosophy. Why do we think they want to rewrite history and get involved in imposing curricula on schools? Because they want to shape the minds of future generations to their vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3318999">But as incrementalists, we cannot expect them to be obvious about it. Their excuse for imposing austerity on Canadians is always based on their ideological buzzwords: jobs, growth and prosperity. The common sense revolution all over again. Well the reality is that their approach makes no sense at all for creating jobs, growth and prosperity. Let us consider the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319000">Despite having chosen the path of austerity, Europe, the U.S. and the Canadian economy are not getting any better and the world economic crisis, despite a few good weeks here and there, is nowhere close to the long-term sustainable recovery and strength we have seen in the past. The Conservatives have had to contort themselves to make any sense out of this and how their pie in the sky ideology is not working. That is because their heads are trapped in a utopian, capitalist, ideological cloud. The reality is that ever since a modern free market has existed there has always been state intervention, and in most cases it has been positive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319001">The Conservative approach is also based on another myth, a sacred cow so to speak, that somehow corporations invest the savings from tax cuts back into their operations, thus creating jobs, expanding the economy, and generating even bigger revenues for governments. From this perspective, governments should keep slashing corporate taxes, presumably right down to zero. If the tax cuts of recent years continue, that state of nirvana will be reached in 20 years. This is their belief and it is a belief empty of facts. In fact, the worst financial years have always been under conservative governments. Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s, Bush and now the present <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are examples of how extreme conservative economic policies lead to greater crises in the economy, not less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319002">I am exaggerating right, because I am a social democrat? Well, in 2000, the combined federal-provincial tax rate was just over 42%. A decade later this figure has fallen to 28%. The Conservative government would cut it to 25% by fiscal 2013. Members can do the math.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319003">The problem that members might be wondering about is that Conservatives have forgotten about something very simple: globalization. What the other benches do not understand is that there is no guarantee in a global market that corporations will reinvest in jobs in countries to which they have no loyalty. Members should not take it from me, here is what <I>The Globe and Mail</I> had to say about it:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canadian companies have added tens of billions of dollars to their stockpiles of cash at a time when tax cuts are supposed to be encouraging them to plow more money into their businesses....But an analysis of Statistics Canada figures by <I>The Globe and Mail</I> reveals that the rate of investment in machinery and equipment has declined in lockstep with falling corporate tax rates over the past decade.

              <ParaText id="3319005">However, what big corporations seem to be doing quite well is investing in themselves and in their salaries. The rate paid for a CEO is up at least 100% since the recession. Saved tax dollars are going into bigger salaries, not helping the economy or suffering Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319006">Also large corporations are now more likely to hide this money than use it.<I>The Globe and Mail</I> reported that, “Investment in equipment and machinery has fallen to 5.5 per cent in 2010 as a share of Canada's total economic output from 6.8 per cent in 2005 and 7.7 per cent in 2000.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319007">Buying machinery is a good thing, and expanding one's business means stimulating the economy and creating jobs. Now all of this is not to talk about the human cost, which is to drive up the rate of exploitation of the workforce. Their main tactic is to increase the proportion of profit and salary while simultaneously taking advantage of hard economic times to reduce labour costs, and we wonder why they want Canadians to be paid as little as foreign workers. Temporary foreign workers should not be making a substandard wage in the first place. Not surprisingly, the average level of unemployment among Canadian workers rose dramatically during these Conservative government golden years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319008">In other words, tax breaks and handouts have failed to live up to the predictions of Conservative economists and politicians. The gap between the rich and the working class is at record levels. Over 1.5 million Canadians remain unemployed, and that is just according to understated official figures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319009">Funding for social programs, health and education is clearly not a priority, and corporate CEOs and shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319010">Another study released on April 6 by the Canadian Centre of Policy Alternatives shows that, “After a decade of corporate tax cuts, the benefits to Canada’s largest corporations are clear but the job creation payoff for Canadians hasn’t materialized.” The study tracked 198 companies on the S&amp;P/TSX composite index from 2000 to 2009. Those 198 companies are making 50% more profit and paying 20% less tax than they did a decade ago, but in terms of job creation, “they did not keep up with the average growth of employment in the economy as a whole. From 2005 to 2010, the number of employed Canadians rose 6% while the number of jobs created by the companies in this study grew by only 5%.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319011">We on the benches on this side of the House have a different approach, a more balanced one, which takes into consideration the needs of small and medium-sized businesses that, contrary to the lobbyists in the PMO's office, actually create the majority of jobs in this country.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="170578" Type="2">Mr. John Weston (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3319034">Mr. Speaker, we live in an extraordinary time. Canadians are consistently expressing gratitude for our economic blessings. Again and again, we hear evidence why our economy, under our <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, and this Conservative government, is truly the toast of the world. The evidence is clear: over 900,000 net new jobs since July 2009; the best debt-to-GDP ratio in the western world; and an investment climate which <I>Forbes </I> magazine calls number one in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319035">My purpose in rising today is to highlight aspects of the environment which are integral to our economic success and which figure prominently in budget 2013. I hope by the end of this debate that my colleagues will share with me the notion that the environment is the economy; a notion that goes beyond the more traditional paradigm that suggests the economy and the environment must be in balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319036">I am delighted to work in a House where we have a <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> who has worked relentlessly on improving climate change, both domestically and internationally. He has done a sector-by-sector effect of GHG assessment, recorded great accomplishments in responsible resource development, and with his predecessors has increased our parkland by over 50%. These are amazing accomplishments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319037">Every time we consider whether environmental and economic factors are in balance, we are suggesting that the environment and the economy are in conflict with one another. Another way to articulate this supposed polarity is that the one must make sacrifice for the other to advance. In other words, we tend wrongly to start our discussion from the notion that the economy and the environment are at war with one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319038">In encouraging Canadians to rethink the economy and the environment, let us have a look at the importance of this discussion. The organization ECO Canada, a foundation which was founded in 1992 and is the country's largest online resource for environmental jobs, training and recruitment, says that some 682,000 jobs in Canada are directly related to the environment; that is, the people in those jobs spend 50% or more of their work time relating to the environment. That is a staggering number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319039">Today I would like to point to our budget to reset the discussion around the notion that the environment is the economy. As we perhaps discuss the quality of life of Canadians, instead of how the economy and the environment are struggling against one another, our budget in its genius brings out many ways in which this government views our economy and our environment to be interrelated and coexisting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319040">Starting with this, let us call it a fresh view of the interrelated environment and economy, how can we continue with policies of economic growth? How must our processes be designed to evaluate infrastructure projects that might facilitate responsible resource extraction?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319041">Constituents of mine, as individuals and in groups, have consistently expressed their support for Canada's economic success but have also stood for responsible environmental practices befitting of a riding which many call the most beautiful place on earth. Some of these proud Canadians include David Bromley, a world-renowned environmental engineer; the Sea to Sky Fisheries Roundtable coordinator Dave Brown; Carl Halvorson of the North Vancouver Outdoor School, based in Squamish; and Squamish First Nation Elder, Randall Lewis. Other groups and individuals who have articulated to me clearly the priority they put on fisheries habitat issues include the West Vancouver Streamkeeper group, including leaders such as John Barker and Mike Akerly, the Pacific Salmon Foundation, and the Future of Howe Sound Society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319042">What is in this budget for fisheries? In the past and current sessions of this Parliament, ministers of fisheries and of the environment have visited our riding and have heard directly from stakeholders, such as those of whom I just spoke. They have heard loud and clear about the importance of protecting fish habitat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319043">I am, therefore, especially proud to highlight two provisions in this budget which would respond directly to concerns such as those raised by these constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319044">First, Ottawa would contribute $10 million over two years, across Canada, for partnerships with local groups on fisheries and habitat conservation measures. That is something that my colleagues and members right around this House ought to be rejoicing about. There is a direct relationship between this budget and the millions of Canadian volunteers, anglers and recreational fishers who would benefit from this excellent measure.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319045">Second, the Vancouver-based Pacific Salmon Foundation would see its funding increase from about $300,000 a year to $1 million a year as a result of changes in how the government would allocate revenue from the sale of conservation stamps that fishermen would have to purchase when they acquire licences. The Pacific Salmon Foundation is one of the best organizations in Canada in terms of galvanizing volunteers and leveraging government funds many times over, so I am delighted that this foundation has made its voice heard in such an effective way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319046">Let us look at conservation and biodiversity. John Fraser is in Ottawa today. He is a former minister of fisheries and of the environment. As you know, Mr. Speaker, he is a former Speaker of the House, whose 1991 decision influenced your recent decision concerning members' statements in the House. Mr. Fraser is one of many Conservatives who have created a strong environmental legacy. Among other things, he assisted former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in creating the acid rain treaty with the Americans to clean up our Great Lakes, and he contributed to the founding of a national park in what we now know as Haida Gwaii. Therefore, with the distinguished Mr. Fraser on Parliament Hill today, it is especially meaningful to refer to the remarkable record of this government regarding conservation and biodiversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319047">Environment Canada's collaboration with the Nature Conservancy of Canada and other organizations has resulted in the protection of more than 354,000 hectares, including habitat for 146 species at risk. Our investments include $10 million to safeguard the Flathead River Valley in British Columbia. Since 2006, the Government of Canada has added 148,754 square kilometres to Parks Canada's network of protected areas, which is a tremendous accomplishment for this <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> and his predecessors. As a result, we have increased the total land and water that comes under our stewardship by more than half. The government's investment of $143 million over 10 years to create Canada's first national urban park in the Rouge Valley of Toronto is a fine example of action. John Fraser will be happy to hear that we are carrying on his great environmental legacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319048">What would be in the budget for the environment generally? Well, environmental concerns in B.C. would focus heavily on tanker safety, and Canada is a world-class regulator with an almost unblemished record of tanker safety on the west coast. The Government of Canada would take further action to ensure it continues this world-class tanker safety system for shipping oil and liquefied natural gas safely through Canada's waterways before any major new energy export facilities become operational. New measures would strengthen Canada's current system, including increased tanker inspections, new and modified aids to navigation, and the establishment of a Canadian Coast Guard incident command system, which would allow it to respond more effectively to an incident and integrate its operations with key partners. The government has also introduced the safeguarding Canada's seas and skies act, and a new expert panel to review Canada's current tanker safety and proposed measures to strengthen it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319049">With the new Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, we would provide greater certainty for industry at the same time as increasing penalties in order to ensure compliance. This would allow our natural resources to be developed in a responsible and timely way. We would work to ensure accountability and transparency from industry by conducting a review of industry reporting through the national pollutant release inventory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319050">These are other concrete examples of Canada strengthening its environmental protection, and there is more. The National Energy Board inspections of oil and gas pipelines would increase by 50% annually to improve pipeline safety across Canada. Canada would double the number of comprehensive audits of oil and gas pipelines to identify potential safety issues before they occur. New enforceable environmental assessment decision statements would ensure that proponents of resource and other economic projects would comply with required mitigation measures to protect the environment. New administrative monitoring penalties would be introduced for violations to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the National Energy Board Act to help ensure compliance. Companies that violate Canada's environmental laws would now face strong, stiff, new financial penalties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319051">If members agree with me that the environment is the economy, they will note what the next provision means in terms of its distinctiveness from the previous Liberal approach on the environment which focused on endless debate, vague objectives and unenforceable provisions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319052">In contrast to that previous Liberal approach, budgets of this Conservative government have created a $1.5 billion trust fund to help provinces and territories invest in major projects that clean our air and result in real GHG emission reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319053">This government is committed to reducing Canada's total GHG emissions by 17%, from 2005 levels, by 2020, and is halfway to meeting its target, a target that is inscribed in the Copenhagen accord. That is concrete and measurable evidence of progress on the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319054">The government is also following a sector-by-sector regulatory approach to align with the United States to achieve GHG emission reductions. To date, stringent regulations to reduce GHG emissions in the electricity and transport sectors have been implemented. In addition, work is also under way to develop regulations for the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319055">Our environmental approach is comprehensive and will continue to include actions that create a cleaner healthier environment, improve the lives of Canadians, and support the development and deployment of new environmental and cleaner energy technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319056">Let us look at a bit more of our history. To maintain a strong economy, Canada requires a healthy environment that provides sustainable resources and supports a high quality of life. That is why our government is committed to ensuring that Canada's enviable and pristine environment, never better evidenced than in the riding I represent, is protected and strengthened for current and future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319057">In conclusion, our government listens to stakeholders and is convinced that the environment is the economy and that we are acting in measurable ways to protect it. Secondly, our government is protecting our fisheries. Thirdly, our government is making improvements on environmental protection in a practical and measurable way that allows for responsible resource development.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319075">In my opinion, the short title of this bill, <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">Economic Action Plan 2013 Act, No. 1</Document>, is not really appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319076"> After reading through this bill, I am once again disappointed to see that there is nothing in it that will bring about economic recovery or create jobs or make life more affordable for Canadians. On the contrary, the Conservatives have raised taxes on a number of consumer goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319077"> Budget 2013 is full of tax increases on hospital parking, safety deposit boxes, labour-sponsored investment funds, bicycles and baby buggies. These increases even affected hockey helmets, until my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170117" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> pointed that out and the government had to cancel the increases on hockey helmets and sports equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319078"> These tax increases will cost Canadians $8 billion over the next five years. This budget will not just raise the cost of living. It will also slow economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319079"> The Parliamentary Budget Officer analyzed the economic situation and the bills brought in by this government. She found that budget 2012, the 2012 update and budget 2013 will result in the loss of 67,000 jobs by 2017 and will cause a 0.57% decline in the GDP. I do not need to say that this is not a good thing for our country’s economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319080"> With wages stagnating, uncertain jobs and families heavily in debt, the Conservatives are proposing austerity measures that add to the cost of living for Canadian families and stifle economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319081"> This bill contains a number of complex measures that deserve to be considered and examined carefully. For the third time in their current term, however, the Conservatives are proposing to evade the oversight of parliamentarians and the public. I find this insulting on several levels. We are here to examine bills. When the government imposes gag orders, we cannot do our job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319082"> This bill contains changes to the temporary foreign worker program. The Conservatives are proposing to close major loopholes by giving the department the last word when work permits or opinions about a permit application become a source of political embarrassment. That does not solve the main problem, which is the mismanagement of the temporary foreign worker program by the present government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319083">I have received many emails from the people of <Affiliation DbId="170121" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> criticizing the changes in Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> that enable the government to compel a crown corporation to have its negotiating mandate approved by the Treasury Board so that it can reach a collective agreement with a union, particularly in the case of the CBC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319084">The people of Berthier—Maskinongé do not want to see any politician exercise that kind of control over our national public broadcaster. The changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> constitute an all-out attack on the right to free collective bargaining in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319085">The NDP opposes Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> based on its content, but also on the process used. With so little time to study of the bill, members cannot consider its consequences. Once again, the Conservatives are trying to keep Canadians in the dark, and it is Canadians who will ultimately pay the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319086">Today I would like to focus on a few specific aspects of the bill. I have noticed a truly disturbing trend in this government's legislative program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319087">Several changes made recently show how little the Conservatives know about the need for a long-term strategy for our regions. I am thinking in particular of the elimination of the labour-sponsored funds tax credit, the employment insurance reform and the cuts to all services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319088">One important measure that has drawn my attention is the cancellation of the labour-sponsored funds tax credit in this last budget. The government has announced the phasing-out of the 15% tax credit it grants for shareholders of labour-sponsored funds.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319089">This decision is a serious mistake and shows that the Conservatives understanding nothing about Quebec's economic model and the role these funds play in the province and, of course, in the economies of the rural regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319090">Ninety per cent of the amounts that Ottawa wants to recover with this measure will come from Quebec savers and investors, since virtually all of these funds are in Quebec. This decision will mainly affect the middle class and its ability to save for retirement, in addition to depriving Quebec SMEs of significant support for their development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319091">Once again, the government has turned a deaf ear, just as it did on the employment insurance reform. On April 27, thousands of people from several Quebec regions demonstrated in downtown Montreal against the Conservative government's butchering of employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319092">This reform is a serious attack on the most vulnerable workers in our society, most of whom are women. It will also affect families and regions. Once again, despite the demonstration, the Conservatives are not listening to Canadians, and I find that truly sad and deplorable, particularly when I see families and workers trying hard to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319093">This reform strikes a hard blow to the economic health of our regions. In my riding, thousands of people hold seasonal jobs. A large segment of the economy depends on seasonal work, including farming, tourism, construction and forestry. The list is long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319094">Employment insurance reform will have disastrous consequences for a number of regions. The Conservatives did not assess the impact of such a reform. They are refusing to listen to the protestors who are calling on the government to back down. I am also wondering what happened to their 2011 campaign slogan, “Our region in power”. I have the impression that their slogan should now be “The regions—who cares?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319095">Why not try to create real jobs and support local initiatives? In short, I am talking about this reform to remind the government that it is a real disaster. As if that were not enough, the government is adding insult to injury with the labour-supported funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319096">Another important aspect of the bill is the elimination of the supplementary tax credit for credit unions. Our credit unions play a vital role in our rural communities. Last year, I had the honour of being on the Special Committee on Co-operatives, where my Conservative and Liberal colleagues and I heard testimony that shed light on the remarkable work co-operatives do in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319097">Perhaps some members were more attentive than others, because I now see that the supplementary tax credit for co-operatives will be eliminated. That will seriously limit the ability of credit unions to compete with large banks, when what the banking sector needs is more competition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319098">Last year, the Conservatives put an end to the co-operative development initiative and made cuts to the rural secretariat. Now, it is the co-operatives' turn. Do the Conservatives not understand that these changes are going to hit our rural regions hard, both in Quebec and in the rest of the country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319099">Tabling a budget means making choices. The budget implementation bill shows that the Conservatives are choosing not to support families, workers or our young people. Last year, when we debated the budget 2012 implementation bills—Bills <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>—many of my New Democrat colleagues, as well as economic analysts, warned us that we would not have time to understand everything the omnibus bills contained and that the long-term impact would be felt for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319100">We are finding out the implications of those bills again today, and I am afraid the same thing will happen with Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>. Our children will be the ones to feel the effects of the Conservatives' misguided policies, when they are longer be around to be accountable. I hope they will be willing to listen to our concerns and make the required changes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319104">As I said in my speech, a budget is about choices. It is about being responsible. There are 1.4 million Canadians who are unemployed. When I see the youth of my generation not being able to find jobs out of college and being so heavily indebted, these are not good choices. In my riding, there are a lot of small and medium-sized businesses. I do not see any measures in this budget that would help people or businesses in my riding.

              <ParaText id="3319105">Mr. Speaker, I want to pick up on the member's comments with regard to credit unions. This is something Liberals have raised in question period and in speeches to try to draw more attention. The government asks what it can do to improve things in the budget, and this is just one of many things it could do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319106">Let us recognize the important role credit unions play, in particular, in smaller communities that do not have access to banking. Another way of looking at it is that smaller credit unions provide a great deal of competition, thereby ensuring that there are at least better service fees. Fees are still far too high within the banking industry or the financial industry as a whole, but the bottom line is that there is healthy competition when there are enriched credit unions. Credit unions play a phenomenal role in providing support for many of the regions that are not getting the type of support they could get from the banking industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319107">I wonder if the member would like to expand upon her comments with regard to just how important those tax credits were for that industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319108">Mr. Speaker, co-operatives and credit unions are very important. They are also very democratic. It is member based, and members take care of each other. In my riding, there are quite a few co-ops, and as a result of what I learned after having been on the special committee for co-operatives, I know they are based out of a need. They come together and create jobs. They are democratic and give back to the community. When credit unions make money, they do not get rich or give bonuses to the higher ups, they give back to the community. That is something we need to encourage. This is a good measure and a step in the right direction to keep this credit. It is a simple step.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319127">Low taxes are an integral part of our budget, and we are on track to balance the budget by 2015-2016. Economic action plan 2013 would announce more savings in government spending, totalling $2 billion by 2015-2016. We would implement a number of very important measures here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319128">I would also like to talk about how our economic action plan would help Manitoba, and indeed all the provinces of Canada, manage the important infrastructure demands and services to Canadians that are so important to our country's economic well-being. Federal support to the provinces has reached historic levels of $62 billion. Federal support to Manitoba is at an all-time high of $3.4 billion, up 21% from under the previous Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319129">Indeed, the total Manitoba provincial budget is funded 40% by the federal government, and it is still raising taxes. Our Conservative government has done this while keeping taxes low and maintaining the transfers. Unlike the high-taxing NDP and Liberals, our Conservative government believes in low taxes and leaving more money where it belongs: in the pockets of hard-working Canadian families and job-creating businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319130">Since 2006, we have cut taxes more than 150 times, reducing the overall tax burden to its lowest level in 50 years. While the NDP opposite thinks governments can spend money better than citizens, it is our firm belief that citizens should spend as much of their own money as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319131">We have cut taxes in every way the government collects them, including personal taxes, consumption taxes, businesses taxes, excise taxes and much more. This has meant savings of more than $3,000 per year to the average family of four. We have done all this while maintaining the transfers to the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319132">We stand in stark contrast to the NDP Government of Manitoba and its NDP colleagues in Ottawa. The Manitoba NDP is now raising the provincial sales tax to 8% to pay for its years of fiscal recklessness. Its federal leader in the House wants to create a carbon tax to generate another $21 billion for further irresponsible spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319133">Manitobans and Canadians are quickly coming to realize that the tax and spend ways of the NDP are not sustainable. To repeat an important point, one simply cannot spend oneself rich.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319134">We can see the difference in approaches when we look at Manitoba versus Saskatchewan. A two-income family of four earning $60,000 in Saskatchewan will pay an estimated $1,593 to its provincial government in income taxes, PST and the gas tax. The same family in Manitoba earning $60,000 will pay a mind-boggling $4,525 in taxes to the Manitoba NDP government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319135">Our Conservative government has taken the alternate path for the past seven years. We have paid down $37 billion of the debt. Our fiscal responsibility and aggressive debt reduction have placed Canada in the very best possible position to weather the global recession. This is something the NDP simply does not understand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319136">It is in our country's best interests to have a strong fiscal position to weather any downturns that may occur. While other countries continue to struggle with debt that is spiralling out of control, Canada is in the best fiscal position in the G7. Our net debt to GDP ratio is 35.8%, the lowest level among G7 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319137">While the NDP and Liberals want to engage in reckless spending, our Conservative government is on track to return to balanced budgets in 2015-2016. That plan is working. Indeed, in the last two years, we have cut the deficit by more than half. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319138">Budget 2013 would build on these efforts to reduce government spending, by announcing an additional $1.7 billion in ongoing savings. Overall, measures taken by this government since budget 2010 would result in total ongoing savings of roughly $14 billion. Unlike the parties opposite, the Liberals and the NDP, and I assume the Greens, our Conservative government will not raise taxes on Canadians to balance the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319139">What are the benefits to my home province of Manitoba? We have the Canada jobs grant to help more Canadians find high-quality and well-paying jobs. We have tax breaks for manufacturers who buy new machinery, and an extended hiring credit for small businesses. There is a record $70 billion of federal investment into infrastructure across Canada over the last few years. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319140">There are major investments in research and technology and new tax relief for Canadians who give to charities, adopt a child or rely on home care services. Import tax tariffs have been eliminated on many everyday items that Canadian families buy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319141">Economic action plan 2013 also confirmed the Conservative government's continued all-time record support for hospitals, schools and other important health and social services. In 2013, the federal transfer support to Manitoba is planned to be $643 million higher than under the former Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319142">My province tends to flood from time to time, given our geographic location; our government has also delivered $100 million in advance payments to the Province of Manitoba for the flood of 2011 under the Disaster Financial Assistance Act. It is estimated that once all the costs have been tallied, the federal government's share will be close to $500 million under the DFAA. Our Conservative government has gone beyond that by announcing another $99 million for flood mitigation across Canada in 2012 to help prevent future damage to infrastructure, homes and farms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319143">In terms of agriculture, we are doubling the current deduction limit under the restricted farm loss income tax rules from $8,700 to over $17,500. This is of huge benefit to many young producers and farm families when some members work off the farm and may have built up farm losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319144">We are increasing the lifetime capital gains exemption to $800,000 from $750,000. This would make it easier for our Canadian farmers to plan for their retirement and transfer family farms to the next generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319145">We are investing $165 million in Genome Canada, which has developed new technologies for the agricultural sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319146">In terms of environmental initiative, I would like to compliment my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170578" Type="2">West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country</Affiliation>. He listed some of the incredible environmental initiatives that our government has undertaken. As the chair of the Conservative hunting and angling caucus, I am proud of the $10 million that has been announced for work on fisheries conservation projects in partnership with local fisheries conservation groups. This is something that our hunting and angling caucus has asked for, and it would create tremendous environmental benefits across the country. As a fisheries biologist myself, I can say that this program will do wonders for our recreational fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319147">I would note, contrary to what the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> said, that these kinds of partnerships are now allowed under the new Fisheries Act, and we will see clear, delivered conservation benefits because of our new Fisheries Act. In terms of the environment, that is the difference between this side of the House and the other parties opposite. The Conservative environmental policy generates real, measurable environmental results on the ground; the other side just talks.</ParaText>

It turns out that the family that saves $3,000 in taxes is a family of four with two working parents making an income of $100,000. I do not know about others, but that is way above the median income in my riding. Furthermore, the share of the national debt of that family of four has increased by $16,000 in the last five years, so those tax savings are totally illusory.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Library and Archives Canada also experienced a wave of job losses last summer with the termination of twenty-one archivists and archival assistant positions, a fifty per cent reduction in digitization and circulation staff, and the elimination of the interlibrary loans program. The cuts compounded past reductions in the LAC budget and the series of “modernization” policies that have reduced public access to archival materials and compromised the ability of LAC to acquire new records.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319183">This is a legitimate concern, because instead of saying that we are going to pare down the budget, look at a substantial review, look at practices within certain departments that are inefficient and eliminate them or put them on hold until a later date when we can afford them, the Conservatives, like many governments nowadays, are saying that they are going to make these cuts, and it will be better for them. They will give them less food, but they will feel more full. Where is the logic in that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319184">Library and Archives Canada is a good example. They claim that it will be that much more efficient and that much better for the end-user, in this case, anyone who wants to find out about the history of this country and the story behind who we are.

Parks Canada was hit the hardest by layoffs in the civil service as a result of last year's budget. It was $29 million annually, resulting in an estimated 638 job losses. This is quite a hit to take. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319186">What we expect from this particular implementation bill and other bills that follow is the transparency to say that this is how we are going to pare down these services. What the Conservatives do not do is to seek the advice of those who are involved in day-to-day operations, as illustrated by Library and Archives Canada and Parks Canada. Now we see, paramount to a lot of things in Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, that it also contains this measure.</ParaText>

The total increase is $5.5 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319231">I am proud to be a member of a government that is committed to a solid plan for the near and long term. I am proud of a <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who have put the economy first. However, I am also immensely proud of Canadians who continue to work hard, do their best and make Canada the greatest country in the world. There is no better way this is shown than through community service and charitable giving. It has been my honour and privilege to serve on many community agencies in the city of Mississauga with passionate volunteers for more than three decades. I see the wonderful work that each and every one of them does, and I see the tremendous generosity of people who donate to these vital organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319232"> That is why I am so delighted to see that this bill would implement a new super credit for first-time donors to charitable organizations, so that we may bring in thousands of new contributors to support these important services. Charitable giving promotes philanthropy and good citizenship while helping others when they need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319233">I had the distinct pleasure to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Peel Children's Aid Society and Peel Children's Aid Foundation, and I am very pleased to see that this bill would allow certain adoption-related expenses, incurred before a child's adoption file is opened, to be now eligible for the adoption expense tax credit. Our CAS system plays a very important role in adoption, and any way we can help families with the costs of this would be greatly appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319234">I see as well that there is good news in this bill for veterans. The bill would amend the War Veterans Allowance Act to ensure that veterans' disability benefits would no longer be deducted when calculating the war veteran allowance, and the contributions for the last post fund for funeral and burial services would be doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319235">Further, this budget is very good news for our partners in the municipalities across Canada. Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> proposes to index the gas tax revenue that is sent to municipalities, which they use for important transit and transportation infrastructure that suits local needs. Our last budget made this transfer permanent, and this one would ensure that the funds would grow with inflation. This government respects our towns and cities, and works with them as true partners. I am certain that in my own city of Mississauga these important funds would help our city continue to grow and provide needed transportation infrastructure for many years to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319236">As a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, I am very pleased to see that this bill proposes changes to the temporary foreign worker program, to ensure that it operates within its original mandate—to permit the use of foreign workers on a temporary basis in certain sectors where Canadians cannot fill those jobs—and to ensure ultimate accountability through a new registration and fee process. While there has been much media fanfare about the TFW program, it is still a vital system for some areas of the country and should be improved, not scrapped. Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> proposes a strengthened program with the proper checks and balances as we move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319237">There is also new support for job creators. Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> proposes changes to the mineral exploration tax credit, it would extend the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance rate for machinery and equipment, and it would modernize the general preferential tariff regime for developing countries to help Canadian companies better compete with foreign firms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319238">It also would provide more than $70 million in tariff relief for families purchasing sports equipment or baby clothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319239">Through this budget, the Government of Canada is renewing its commitment of fiscal transfers to the provinces for equalization until March of 2019, providing them that important sense of stable funding. Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document> would make a number of changes that continue Canada moving on the path of better jobs and greater prosperity. It sets an important tone of confidence and responsibility at times that are still cautious and fragile. This is not the time to propose huge new tax increases on Canadians or go on wild spending sprees. We cannot play fast and loose with Canadians' hard-earned tax dollars, and we cannot slag our trading partners and the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319240">As we move forward, I look forward to the implementation of the new Canada job grant with the provinces and employers; I look forward to the ten-year renewal of the Canada building fund with provinces and municipalities; I look forward to the five-year renewal of the affordable housing program and the homelessness partnering strategy; I look forward to the renewal of the hiring tax credit for Canada's job creators; I look forward to new investments in innovation and technology; and I look forward to Canada's continued economic leadership at home and in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319270"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and join my colleagues in support of Bill <Document DbId="5823390" Type="4">S-213</Document>, an act to establish Korean War veterans day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319271">I would like to offer a special thanks to my colleague the hon. Senator Yonah Martin, who proposed this legislation, and thank her for her tireless work on this initiative and for bringing Bill <Document DbId="5823390" Type="4">S-213</Document> forward. I share her desire to recognize the thousands of Canadian men and women who have served our country and made a significant contribution to international peace and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319272">I would also like to thank our <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> for declaring 2013 the Year of the Korean War Veteran. I was encouraged to hear that the minister recently travelled with 36 veterans to South Korea on a commemorative trip. The minister's work ensures that the Korean War will never be thought of again as the forgotten war. I stand alongside the minister as he continues to stand up for Korean War veterans and all veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319273">I would like to thank the representatives of the Korean War Veterans Association for their support of this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319274">I can assure all members of the House that this government, more than any in recent history, is committed to giving every possible support to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces. We are also committed to ensuring Canadian veterans are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve. They have brought honour to Canada and we in turn will honour them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319275">On November 11, Canadians pause to remember their brave countrymen and women who have given their all in the service of Canada. Through this national act of remembrance, we honour all veterans. We honour those who served in war and those who served in peace. We honour those who served in all theatres of war. We honour those who have served in Canada helping our communities respond to and recover from natural disasters. We honour those who continue to stand for peace and freedom and operations all over the world, most recently in Afghanistan and Libya.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319276">This legislation constitutes a specific recognition of those who served in the Korean War and who selflessly contributed to the peace and security of the Republic of Korea in the years following the armistice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319277">The timing of this legislation is equally significant and appropriate. The year 2013 marks the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice, a milestone worthy of recognition and reflection. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has declared 2013 as the Year of Korea in Canada in part to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice, as well as 50 years of formal diplomatic relations between our two great countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319278">The <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>, as members know, followed the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> lead by also declaring 2013 the Year of the Korean War Veteran in his department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319279">We are proud to honour Canada's veterans for what they have accomplished on land, at sea and in the air during the Korean War. That is why our government has presented certificates of recognition this year to Canadian Korean war veterans. We worked in partnership with the Republic of Korea last month to have 36 Canadian veterans of the Korean War revisit the battlefields where they had served. This trip was very important to these veterans. I will highlight Mr. Harry Marshall, a veteran of the Korean War who said, “It is with many mixed emotions that I take this journey, but it is important to honour all of those who served in this war 60 years ago.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319280">It is for these important reasons that the <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> has promoted a full weekend to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice in Ottawa at the end of June.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319281">The Korean War will always be an important chapter, a defining moment, in our country's proud military history. It deserves special recognition, which is why I urge all members to support this proposed legislation to create a national day in honour of Korean War veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319282">With my remaining time I would like to talk about the extraordinary service and sacrifice of Canada's veterans during the Korean War and begin by placing their efforts within a wider context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319283">As we all know, the First and Second World Wars touched Canadians in every community across this great country, from the largest cities to the smallest towns. Everyone knew someone who had served overseas. Too many had lost a loved one. Against the backdrop of those two great wars, the Korean War seemed a bit different. It was obviously shorter and smaller in scale with far fewer casualties, so how could it possibly compare with the two global conflicts? How could it command Canadians' attention the way the First and Second World Wars had? The hindsight of historians has helped us to understand the importance of the Korean War as well as its tragic impact on so many Canadian heroes and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319284">We now understand how critical it was for Canada and 15 other nations to provide combat troops and halt the spread of tyranny and oppression. I do not think there is anywhere other than the Korean Peninsula where that halt of oppression and tyranny is better shown in the world today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319285">Bill <Document DbId="5823390" Type="4">S-213</Document> would ensure we forever remember the courage and sacrifice of the more than 26,000 brave Canadians who served during the Korean War and the approximately 7,000 who continued to serve after the armistice was signed in 1953.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319286">Through Bill <Document DbId="5823390" Type="4">S-213</Document> we can guarantee that future generations of Canadians never make the same mistake of treating the Korean War as anything less than the devastating war that it actually was.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319287">Of course, Canada's veterans of the Korean War have never forgotten the 516 Canadians who gave their lives in service during the Korean War; the 516 Canadians who made the ultimate sacrifice defending the right of all people to live in peace and freedom. They have never forgotten their comrades who were wounded in battle or the families forever changed by war. They have never forgotten what they witnessed and endured, from the terrible human suffering to the terrifying violence and unending hardships. They remember the overwhelming odds they faced as they were greatly outnumbered on rugged and foreign terrain. They remember the local families fleeing from their homes with only what they could carry on their backs; young children following, hungry and scared. They remember the atrocities, the executions, the purges and massacres that also left countless civilians dead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319288"> In short, Canada's veterans know the brutal truth about the Korean War. They are our clearest window into a great tragedy and, sadly, the passage of time is taking its toll on these Canadian heroes. Only about 10,600 of Canada's Korean veterans remain, most in their eighties or at least very close. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319289">We have an urgent duty as a nation to preserve their stories and to ensure future generations actively remember. The <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> has taken a very active role in ensuring that Canadians are educated about the sacrifices and stories of Korean War veterans. A national day to honour these veterans will help us do that. Korean War veterans day would inspire Canadians to explore our proud past and learn more about the contributions and sacrifices of such a remarkable group of men and women. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319290">When support came to the Republic of Korea in 1950, Canada responded in numbers exceeding what the world might have expected from our country with its relatively small population. What is equally amazing is that many of the Canadians who served in Korea had already served in the Second World War. They had already witnessed unspeakable horrors and experienced great personal loss. They already knew the terrible cost of freedom and they were still willing to pay the price again. That is what made these seemingly ordinary Canadians so truly extraordinary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319291">They willingly travelled halfway around the world to serve in a foreign land; a land unlike anything most of them had ever seen. I am sure each one of them had his or her personal reasons for going, but I also believe they were united in their sense of purpose, and I am sure they would have echoed the words of statesman Edmund Burke who once said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319292">I can only guess at how the course of history may have been different if Canada and her allies had done nothing, if we had stood by and let evil triumph.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319293">We can paint many different pictures of what life in Canada would be like today if the United Nations had not stepped in and if North Korea had not been stopped in its tracks. Quite frankly, it is possible we would not even be here in this chamber today as elected officials in a free and democratic country, if not for the courage of men and women who answered the world's call so many years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319294">That is the legacy we have inherited from our soldiers, sailors, flyers, nurses, doctors and aboriginal veterans who distinguished themselves in a far-off war. We are the direct beneficiaries of their service and bravery. We are only able to serve here today because they served when Canada called upon them. We understand our debt in a very intuitive way, which is why I am so proud to support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319295">I want to talk briefly about my own personal experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319296">I had the privilege last fall of going to Korea with a number of Canadian Korean War veterans and seeing the cemetery in Busan, the United Nations cemetery. I participated in the service with those veterans and from the stories they told me, I could see how much that experience meant to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319297">The Government of Korea and the people of Korea have certainly never forgotten. In fact, when I went to the national war museum in Korea, I could hear children laughing because it was required for so many young people to come through that museum and see what Canada and other countries had done. The names of every soldier who died in the Korean War are on placards outside adorning the entranceway and on various columns and pillars. There are some 40,000 U.S. soldiers and, of course, the 516 Canadians who died or were killed in action, and some 50 who died in service after the armistice was actually signed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319298">I am very grateful to my colleague, Senator Yonah Martin, for giving me this opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319299">What I have in my hand is not a prop, and I do not want anybody to get the notion that is. It is an obituary that has been on the wall of my house that I have had the opportunity to read many times as a youngster growing up. I am doing this right now for my grandpa Don and my Calkins family. It will be tough for me read this, but I will do my best.</ParaText>

On November 20th, 1950, he was sent with the 2nd battalion of the Princess Patricias to train at Fort Lewis, Washington. He was a member of C Company. Surviving besides his parents are his two sisters, Miss Bertie Lloyd of Nordegg and Miss Jo Fredine of Rocky, two brothers, Joe of Rocky and Donald of Lacombe.

I am several generations down and it still affects me to this day. They are family members whom I have never met and never will have the opportunity to meet. I wonder how many other family members I would have had, had they survived. It is with great pleasure that I accept his comments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319309">Moving forward, we have to do everything we can as a nation to remind current and future generations of the tremendous sacrifices that were made by those who came before them. This bill would help to do that. I thank the member for his support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319312">Mr. Speaker, obviously the personal link for me to the Korean War is a matter of public record. It is something that I am passionate about simply because I do not think it has been well documented. It is called the forgotten war. I made comments on that in my speech. However, I can say that for those who served in Korea and for the family members of those who served in Korea, it is not a forgotten war. For too long Canada brushed it aside as a United Nations action. I think it was called a policing action at the time, when the reality is that it was an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319313">One only has to read a book about the Korean War, for example, <I>Triumph at Kapyong </I> by Daniel Bjarnason, which is a fantastic read if anybody has an opportunity to do that. We had our Thermopylae in Korea and it is called the Battle of Kapyong. I did a statement about it here a little while ago. Seven hundred Canadians of 2PPCLI, the same regiment that my great-uncle was a member of, stood in the face of thousands where all others had failed. Seven hundred stood in the face of an onslaught of aggression by thousands and thousands of enemy soldiers, and they held their position for several days. They were only a few kilometres north of the current place where Seoul, Korea is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319314">It is an absolute travesty that we have not actually learned of the tremendous heroic measures. These guys were all volunteers who went over there. They all volunteered to sign up for this. They went over there and did yeoman service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319315"> Nowhere else in the world today is there a more distinct delineation between triumph in a battle and what happens when we fail to preserve liberty, peace and freedom for individuals. The stark contrast is no better displayed anywhere in the world today than the Korean Peninsula.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3319316">Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to stand today and speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="5823390" Type="4">S-213, An Act respecting a national day of remembrance to honour Canadian veterans of the Korean War</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319317">The bill would designate July 27 as Korean War Veterans Day to remember and honour the courage and sacrifice of Canadians who served in the Korean War and performed peacekeeping duties following the armistice of July 27, 1953.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319318">July 27 was chosen because the Korean War armistice was signed on that day in 1953, putting an end to three years of fighting. The contribution of Canadian veterans of the Korean War has gone unrecognized for far too long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319319">This war started shortly after the end of World War II. Unfortunately, historians did not give the Korean War the importance it deserved, given the magnitude of World War II. As a result, the Korean War was too often forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319320">This bill will again focus attention on the Korean War and do right by our veterans who fought in this war by giving them a day of commemoration to remember the sacrifice they made for Canada and South Korea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319321">This bill is in addition to the January 8, 2013, announcement by the <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>, who declared 2013, which marks the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice, the Year of the Korean War Veteran.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319322">Designating 2013 as the Year of the Korean War Veteran will allow Canadians to pay tribute to the 26,000 Canadians in uniform who came to the aid of South Koreans during that war. We will also be able to honour the 516 Canadians who died in service, defending the values of peace, freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319323">The NDP will support this bill because we want to highlight and commemorate the significant contribution made by our armed forces and our veterans, as well as the sacrifices made by their families during this major war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319324">I would like to congratulate the members from all parties and the veterans groups that worked together to create this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319325">Our critic for veterans affairs, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170509" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>, also took part in the drafting of this bill from the beginning. He suggested some improvements that were accepted right away so that everyone could support this important bill in order to do justice to the veterans of the Korean War. Everyone was able to work together for once. It is nice to see that, now and again, we can all contribute to the drafting of a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319326">I would also like to give some general background information on the Korean War conflict. Anyone who would like more detailed information can consult the Veterans Affairs website, which gives an excellent description.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319327">At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union occupied North Korea while the Americans moved into South Korea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319328">After a communist government had been established in the north and a democratic government in the south, tensions between the two governments grew to a climax and, on June 25, 1950, the military forces of North Korea crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea. This marked the beginning of the war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319329">The newly formed United Nations decided to enter into its first armed intervention. Thus, 16 member nations, including Canada, would contribute military forces under the command of the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319330">Early in July 1951, ceasefire negotiations began. However, it was not until 1953 that peace was finally restored on the Korean Peninsula with the signing of the armistice on July 27, 1953.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319331">It took two more years of negotiations and combat before peace was finally restored, when the armistice was signed at Panmunjom. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319332"> As I said, more than 26,000 Canadians were deployed in Korea, including the sailors on eight destroyers and the aviators who took part in numerous combat and transport missions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319333"> I would therefore like to point out that Canada’s contribution was among the largest of all the nations that participated in that conflict. I would also like to point out that the duty to support applies every day, and not just on national memorial days or during Remembrance Week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319334"> In my opinion, tributes from the government are not the only way to honour our veterans. Obviously, the respect we have for our soldiers and how we commemorate our veterans can also be seen in how the government treats them through the services offered by Veterans Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319335"> The NDP listens closely to what our veterans need and are asking for. In fact, our leader has met with a number of veterans’ groups, as recently as this afternoon. That is how we keep in touch with Canadians and listen to what they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319336"> In my opinion, the best way to honour veterans is to treat them fairly. Today, for example, the compensation they are paid when they are injured does not treat them fairly. If they had been injured in a different workplace, various labour boards would have given them a lot more compensation than they receive at present. One of the best ways of paying tribute to our veterans is to treat them fairly. That is why, as the new charter is about to be revised, I call on the government to sit down with veterans and listen to what they are asking for, because there are a number of things to be done to improve the new charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319337"> In conclusion, we are supporting this important bill to give the Korean War and the veterans of that war a day so that it is no longer a forgotten war. This is a significant bill, and we thank the person who introduced it. I hope we will give this bill our unanimous support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319338">Mr. Speaker, I begin my speech by acknowledging the work of Senator Yonah Martin, who has championed and introduced the bill in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319339">The Korean War and armistice have special meaning for Senator Martin, having been born in Seoul, Korea, and being a recipient of Korea's Order of Civil Merit Moran Medal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319340">The Liberal Party joins with the government, the New Democrats and the Green Party in support of Bill <Document DbId="5823390" Type="4">S-213</Document>. The bill would mark each July 27 as a special day to acknowledge the signing of the armistice between South Korea and North Korea, and to honour our soldiers who went there in the service of their country and in support of the United Nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319341">Last month, I was included in that delegation that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170646" Type="2">Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> referred to, which went to South Korea to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. I was there with 36 veterans and their caregivers. It was a very moving experience. I am grateful to have the opportunity this evening to share with the House some of my thoughts about that trip. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319342">The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when the military forces of North Korea crossed into South Korea. Canada, operating under the United Nations, contributed significant combat forces to defend South Korea, and as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="181257" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation> pointed out, this was also a very, very important day in the early history of the United Nations. It was the first time that a United Nations force was deployed, fighting under the United Nations flag.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319343">There were many fierce battles during this conflict, and many soldiers paid the ultimate price. Canadians played a critical role during the war and saw action in the Battle of Kapyong in April 1951. During that two-day battle, 10 Canadians were killed and 23 were wounded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319344">In late October 1952, in a place referred to as Little Gibraltar, Canadians fought bravely, as they did in Kapyong, and held their own against a determined North Korean enemy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319345">There are many other stories of bravery and heroism. In total, more than 26,000 Canadians served in the Korean War, and 516 young Canadians died in the service of others and in defence against aggression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319346">Two other stories about the Korean War also stand out. It was an especially sad day on November 21, 1950, when 17 soldiers of the 2nd Regiment of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery died in a train crash in British Columbia. These 17 soldiers were on their way to Korea. They were ready to take up the challenge and the call to service that would have taken them into a war zone. We cannot and shall not forget those 17 soldiers so tragically lost on that day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319347">The second relates to the contribution of Canadian women during the war. Not unlike the Second World War, women once again stepped up and played a vital role in the service of their country and to the war effort. More than 5,000 Canadian women served during the Korean War. They, too, bore witness to the brutality of war, many of them helping to nurse wounded soldiers. We think of them for their courage and sacrifice to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319348">It is true that there was an armistice in 1953, but hostilities are still evident. While I was there, I was struck that just a mere hour north of Seoul, one is confronted by barbed wire fences that line the waterways. Heavily armed checkpoints are frequent and staffed around the clock. Spiked barrels prevent the easy passage of vehicles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319349">The demilitarized zone still has minefields and explosives set to destroy bridges and roads literally with the flip of a switch. Observation points continue to monitor movements of the enemy all along the 38th parallel. This is just in South Korea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319350">A state of alert continues to exist along the border. Not much is known, really, about North Korea, because of the tight control exercised by that regime. What we do know tells us a story of great poverty, human rights abuses and a country intent on continuing its nuclear weapons program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319351"> It is my hope that one day this armistice will lead to a permanent and lasting peace, a peace that will allow for these two proud nations to set aside the past for good, for the good of harmony and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319352">Having been there, I can say there are a couple of encouraging signs. There is indeed an industrial park in North Korea that is operated with the cooperation of the two governments, with managers coming from South Korea and workers in the north. There also is a ministry of unification within the South Korean government, strangely enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319353">The progress South Korea has experienced in the last 60 years is nothing short of remarkable. It is now the tenth largest economy in the world. The capital, Seoul, is a world-class, vibrant city of 11 million people, with high-rises and modern infrastructure. It has hosted the Olympics as well as the FIFA World Cup. It is a world leader in electronics and manufacturing. We have all heard of Hyundai and Samsung.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319354">Again, what information we do have from North Korea indicates that this communist country has not fared nearly as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319355">There is no question that the Canadian and UN veterans can take pride in and credit for the remarkable progress South Koreans have experienced over the last 60 years. South Korea has gone from being a recipient of foreign aid to a contributor. Canadians have helped a world citizen achieve its potential. It is the international community, not just the South Koreans, that is better for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319356">The South Koreans have not forgotten. Everywhere the Canadian delegation went in Seoul, Busan, Kapyong and points in between, there were civilians waving, smiling and thanking us. Those smiling and acknowledging their Canadian heroes did so in a way that movingly broke through the language barrier. That was completely separate from the official, formal and military expressions of gratitude that were extended. Everyday citizens reacted to our veterans in a way that was spontaneous and heartfelt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319357">I should acknowledge the <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> who led our delegation of Korean War veterans in Korea. We were there, as I indicated, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. The minister included representatives from each of the opposition parties. The bipartisanship he has shown in this and in other commemorative events is a good example for his caucus and his cabinet colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319358">We do not know when this conflict will finally end. We do hope that one day North Korea, a place of repression and secrecy, will begin to open up and allow more freedom and the protection of human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319359">We also hope that one day the sacrifice made 60 years ago by Canadian soldiers and others in defence of freedom will result in better conditions for the people of North Korea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319360">I again want to congratulate the government for bringing this bill forward to the House of Commons and, again, thank Senator Martin for her service and dedication to the people of Korea and for efforts to make this special day to mark the end of the Korean War a reality.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319378">I am sure that many Canadians might ask themselves why the House of Commons would be taking a few extra hours on a Tuesday night to debate a question that to many Canadians may seem so far away.

              <ParaText id="3319379">It is because of where Syria is. It is a country of 22.5 million people in the middle of the Middle East, which over the last number decades has been perhaps the most difficult and challenging part of the world in terms of resolving conflict and dealing with the potential possibility of hostilities taking over and becoming even more serious than they are already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319380">It is a country that has become the test for the United Nations own sense of role and responsibilities to ensure civilians are protected and that there is human security for those people who are facing the challenge of how they will live, survive and get their next meal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319381">It is a country that not for a few years but for several decades has been ruled by a brutal dictatorship, that being the Assad family, the father and now the son, representing a relatively small religious sect within Islam, the Alawite sect. It has achieved the monopoly of the security service, armed itself significantly, and dramatically repressed the population, which has effectively closed its economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319382">It is a country which in the face of the changes that are under way throughout the region has resisted every single one of these changes, in terms of opening up the economy, recognizing the plural nature of its society, establishing good relations with its neighbours and allowing a real sense of opportunity to its people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319383">Therefore, it really has been no surprise that at a time when there has been this movement called the Arab Spring—though some people now feel that is an inappropriately optimistic term to describe it—there would be strong elements within Syria that would insist that the country become more pluralistic and democratic, that it recognize human rights and that it allow its people to have their say in who their government would be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319384">When faced with this challenge from within, the Assad regime chose one particular path, that being the path of repression. That is a path which has caused enormous hardship to the people of Syria and which has caused great instability, not only in Syria but also throughout the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319385">We now find that in a country of 22.5 million, some 1.5 million of them are now refugees living outside the country. That is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of people who, as the saying goes, are internally displaced. These are people who have been forced to leave their homes, forced to move somewhere else, or have had to leave whatever community they may have been in to get to a safer place. Of those 1.4 million refugees, some 62,000 are in Egypt, 143,000 in Iraq, 450,000 in Jordan, 450,000 in Lebanon and over 320,000 in Turkey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319386">By any definition, whatever else we face in Syria, whatever else may be said about the instability of what forces are at play, the overall security situation in the country, the challenge facing the security of the region itself from the violence and the repression in Syria, what we know for certain is that this is a humanitarian crisis of the first proportion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319387"> This is an issue which affects not only the conscience of the world and therefore of Canada, but this is an issue which has to be dealt with on a practical basis. The presence of this many refugees in Jordan, and the presence of this many refugees in Lebanon and Turkey, poses a security risk and a threat to those countries, to say nothing of the financial risk and the financial threat which they face as a result of having this many people suddenly descend on them. These are not wealthy countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319388">The minister is going to describe to us some of the things which the Government of Canada has been doing with respect to the refugee situation in Jordan, and I am afraid that members on our side are simply going to have to say “not yet enough”. There is still more to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319389">There is more to be done, in a few ways. The first is assisting these countries to deal with the refugee crisis in their midst. The second is assisting the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to deal with the continuing challenge it faces with having to run these camps. The third is to deal in a much more effective, efficient and advanced basis with the claims of many of those refugees to be reconciled with their relatives in Canada. That is as opposed to many other situations where we have responded more effectively as a country, and I think most recently of the crisis in Haiti, where claims for immigration were sped up so people could be reconciled with their families and we provided far more humanitarian aid. I would argue that in this situation Canada has been relatively slow to respond, proportionately to other countries certainly, and proportionately to the seriousness of the situation that is facing these countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319390">Let us first of all recognize the humanitarian nature of the crisis. Let us recognize the fact that at the very least Canada has to be more engaged with other countries in dealing with the seriousness of the challenge posed to Syria's neighbours by virtue of the size and the extent of the refugee crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319391">My colleagues have spoken earlier, and my colleague from Scarborough held a press conference last week. He described the urgent challenge facing a great many people in these communities, where it appears the Canadian government has not been as responsive as it needs to be to the needs of people living in refugee camps. We do not appear to have a program in place that would allow for the speedy treatment and the speedy consideration of claims that are being made for reconciliation with families in Canada. We feel, and I am sure that the House feels the same, that we need to be doing more to respond to the urgent nature of this humanitarian crisis. Let me just complete this point. There is more to be done on the humanitarian crisis. There is more to be done for refugees. Canada needs to do more to step up to the plate and make a difference when it comes to dealing with the extent of the refugee crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319392">If that were the only issue, this could be a simple debate. However, the challenge the world now faces in Syria is one of the most difficult and one of the most complex challenges that we have faced in many different places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319393">As I have said before, we have to recognize the military strength of the Assad regime. The Assad regime has the capacity to repress. It has repressed. It has not hesitated to bomb its own people. It has not hesitated to kill its own people. It has not hesitated to respond to every challenge to it by means of a military response. It has been brutal, and in that brutality the United Nations estimates that as many as 80,000 people may have been killed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319394">If we were to apply a simple test to see if the Assad regime has treated its own people in a brutal fashion and whether that justifies an effective response from the rest of the world, the answer would be yes, to which we could say the world has responded. The world has responded by saying we have to cut Syria off from financial access to other markets. We have to make sure the people who are leading the Syrian regime know how seriously the rest of the world treats what is going on in Syria. We have to make sure that every effort has been made, from a financial point of view, to isolate Syria. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319395">One has to say, as strong as those efforts may have been and as coordinated as they have been, they have not had the effect to sufficiently weaken the Assad regime, to force it into a situation where it has to bargain with the rebels, come to terms with the need for change, and to make every effort to find a political solution to the crisis we face. That has not happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319396">Another simple response would be to say, “Why would the world not simply conclude that if the Syrian regime is not prepared to treat its citizens properly, not prepared to respond to the various resolutions of the Security Council, the United Nations, the Arab League, all of the statements that have been made for the Government of Syria to come to grips with the reality, then why would the world not take further action, military action”?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3319397">Naturally, there are always those who think that military action is required in a situation where a government does not heed global opinion or international laws, such as those made by the United Nations based on decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council to ensure that countries treat their citizens in a fair and equitable manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319398">However, it is important to recognize the problem. The problem that exists in the Middle East currently exists in Syria. Because of the nature of the conflict and Syria's geographic location in the Middle East, there is no easy military solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319399">I just watched the minister on television a moment ago. He said that he would prefer a political solution to a military one. I believe that it is difficult to contradict what the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> said because we would all prefer a political solution to a military one. However, the problem is that people are saying that, without military pressure on Syria, the rebels, those who are revolting against Syria's dictatorial government, will not get help and the Syrian regime will say that there is not a problem, that there is no pressure and that it is not necessary to find solutions. The civil war will therefore continue. That is why we are saying that this is a complex situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319400">However, it is important to remember one thing. Syria is in difficulty. It is in the midst of a civil war. Eighty thousand people are dead because of it. The world cannot just stand by and watch. We must find solutions. That is why we are calling for a greater commitment from the Canadian government.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3319401">I know the minister has said, and I think it is the strongest statement that I have certainly heard, that he is satisfied with the evidence that chemical weapons have been used in the struggle, but the difficulty is finding out who has used them, when they were used and how they were used. Again, I find myself in agreement with the minister. Of course that is what the world has to do, and of course it is proving very difficult to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319402"> Where, in fact, I think there is a need for us to be more engaged and not less engaged as a country is in recognizing the challenge that the instability in Syria creates for the entire region. The instability in Syria affects Lebanon. The instability in Syria affects Jordan. The instability in Syria affects Israel, which is why Israel has felt obliged to respond when faced with evidence that missiles are going from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319403">We cannot look at this situation in isolation. We cannot say that this all seems like a conflict that is so far away that we cannot get involved and cannot be concerned. The reality is that not only is there a humanitarian crisis which demands a response from the rest of the world, there is also a crisis which will not stand still. Unless the world effectively engages with it, the stability of the entire region is threatened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319404">This is why we continue to hear from others in the region that they want to see a more coordinated response from the rest of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319405">I am not one of those who think that Canada itself is going to come up with a magical solution, that somehow there is going to be some miraculous Canadian intervention that will make a difference on its own. We are a middle power; however, we are a middle power with many friends and we are a middle power that is respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319406">As a middle power, we have an obligation to use every means possible to bring two things into effect. The first is to ensure that the oppression and the killing for which the Assad regime is responsible comes to an end. The second is to be part of the effort to use the International Criminal Court to hold those who are responsible for the conflict and for the death and mayhem in Syria to account. If we do not stand up for the rule of international law and for the role of the International Criminal Court, we are simply saying to the Assad regime that it can wash its hands of this conflict and nobody will ask any questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319407">Finally, we have to recognize one other thing. It is not only the use of chemical weapons posing a threat to the very existence of some people and of some communities and it is not only the tremendous instability created by the use of chemical weapons, completely against every order of international law and any test of humanity; it is, as the minister referred to in his public comments, the extent to which Syria has become a playground for extremism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319408">We now know that there are fighters from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Chechnya, as well as fighters who were in Iraq but are now back in Syria. We have to understand that this is the world in which we now live. However, the answer to that is not for Canada to be less engaged with the opposition, but to be even more engaged with the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319409">I do not mean engaged in arming the opposition, as the minister might think I am saying, because that has never been a role that Canada has played. Canada has never played the role of an arms supplier to these various civil insurrections. What Canadians have done is to say we are not afraid of becoming politically engaged and reaching a better understanding who is who and who is where.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319410">When we talk to people from the Syrian community in Canada, their main concern and main complaint, frankly, is that the Conservative government seems to be too determined to take a hands-off approach to even understand the nature of the conflict and the various elements in the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319411">I am not pretending for a moment that it is easy. I am not pretending that it lends itself to easy solutions, and because of the very forces of instability that are now at play, I do not believe at the moment that a one-sided military intervention from the United States or from some other coalition is likely to get us to where we need to be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319412">I strongly support what Secretary Kerry and President Putin have decided to do, which is to hold another conference to get countries together to try and find a political solution. However, I do think we have to recognize that unless the world stands prepared to take the necessary steps to create the stability that we want to see and that the world needs to see in Syria, the risk is even greater instability in the years ahead and even greater hardship for the people who are living there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319413">It is a humanitarian crisis, a political crisis, a security crisis and an issue that demands a response from Canada. We would all like to see a future of stability, one in which the drive from Jerusalem to Damascus and from Damascus to Beirut could happen with nary a checkpoint, a future in which a train ride from Tel Aviv to Beirut could happen with nary a checkpoint. We would like to see that kind of world. It is an open world, a free world and a democratic world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319414">We are not going to get there overnight. We are not going to get there by wishing for it or by praying for it. We are not going to get there by simply analyzing what is happening from a great distance. We have to be prepared to become more engaged. In that engagement, Canada will gain some of the respect and some of the position in the world that Canada deserves for the efforts that it can make and should make in the months ahead.</ParaText>

I would like to take this opportunity to welcome him back to the foreign affairs file and say that we on the foreign affairs committee look forward to working with him in the coming weeks and months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319416">To begin with, I wanted to correct a couple of things that I heard him say that I think were not quite correct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319417">He insinuated that Canada had somehow not done its fair share in humanitarian relief efforts in Syria. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that Canada—and I know he has the means to check these facts—is the largest contributor on a per capita basis to humanitarian relief with respect to Syrian refugees through the refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319418">Turkey is very grateful and thankful for the funds that have been directed from Canada through the Red Crescent Society. I had the opportunity to visit some of those Syrian refugee camps in January with the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration</Affiliation> when that was announced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319419">Second, he mentioned that Turkey was not a wealthy country. Turkey is the 16th-largest economy in the world. It is a G20 nation, and relative to a lot of countries in Europe, it is doing quite well in terms of its economy these days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319420">Many people have suggested that something that could be done to help the people in Syria would be for the international community, including Turkey, to establish a no-fly zone along the Turkish border between Aleppo and the Turkish border. It would be a place where people could go to get away from the fighting and be safe, and anything that attacked them from the air could be knocked down by a coalition of international forces in that region. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319422">Mr. Speaker, I hesitate to improvise military policy on the fly in the House of Commons of Canada. I think a lot of suggestions will be made as to what additional form of military pressure could be put on Syria short of some kind of massive invasion or bombing. My own sense of the current civilian situation is that bombing of any indiscriminate kind would have a huge effect on the civilian population of Syria and would not advance the cause whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319423">The Syrian air force is not exactly without capability, so if we are going to establish a no-fly zone, we have to be aware of what the response would be from the Syrian air force. Our experience with other no-fly zones is that if we want to establish a no-fly zone, we would have to knock out virtually the entire air defence capacity of Syria. Doing that is an enormously complex and difficult undertaking, and one whose consequences one would have to understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319424">My point is that in thinking through what we are going to do, at every step of the way we need to think through what the consequences of these actions would be. What are the next steps going to be? What are the conclusions that we are going to reach?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319425">My concern on the one side is that if we are not prepared to look at every possibility, that will be read by the Assad regime as another get-out-of-jail-free card.

The hon. member just mentioned in his comments that there have been meetings between Secretary of State Kerry and his colleague in Russia.

It is fair to say that like everyone who has tried this approach, he is facing a tremendous challenge, and it is not easy. There are Canadian citizens who are involved in helping Mr. Brahimi in trying to find solutions. It is not at all easy for us to do. As Canadians, we have to encourage every possible avenue of success. </ParaText>

We need to continue to look at what we can do and how we can participate more effectively in those efforts.</ParaText>

Political action can be a response to an extremely complex situation, but it must be an equally complex response. What Canada can and must do is repatriate all those Canadian families who are awaiting visas for their non-Canadian children. Canada must be compassionate and bring back refugees, and it must help the persecuted minorities, including Christians, Kurds and Assyrians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319446"> Canada must definitely not send military troops to Syria. It must not arm the rebels because we know that there are terrorist groups among these utterly fragmented factions.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3319453">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker for granting this debate. It is a tremendously important opportunity to give an update to the House and all Canadians, both on the actions that the Government of Canada has taken to date to address the Syrian crisis and on the most recent developments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319454">The actions this government has taken and the engagement this government has put on this file have been real and significant. I think I share with all civilized people everywhere the frustration that the civilized world has not been able to bring a resolution to this crisis. Many of us have been working tremendously hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319455">This debate tonight is also a chance for us to take stock of where we go from here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319456">As I rise to speak tonight, I am reminded, as I often am when considering the many complex issues relating to the Syrian crisis, of one of the conflict's youngest victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319457">She was a girl of about seven years old. I had a chance to meet her at Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. This was not a good place for a family, living in a tent in a refugee camp in the middle of the desert with the heat and scorpions. As horrible as the situation was for her and her family, I thought of how tough it must have been for her family in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319458"> I thought of how difficult it must have been to make the decision for her and her entire family to leave their home and to seek refuge in another country. I thought of the courage it took for her parents to do that, to want to do one thing, to keep their family safe, just like every Canadian family and every Canadian parent's objective is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319459">She and her family had fled their home. They had left everything they had known in a bid to escape death and destruction that had stalked their hometown. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319460">Many of the refugees crossing the borders into Jordan, and I saw videotapes, have been shot at as they have crossed the border. When I visited a refugee camp, I met with Jordanian authorities. I was shown videos of a man carrying his young baby across the border being shot at, and of a pregnant woman being shot as she sought to enter Jordan and having the physical wherewithal to continue running, only to make it to safety and die in the hospital after. They dodged sniper bullets to make it to what they hoped would be safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319461">This young girl that I talked to had quite an effect on me. She has lost some, if not a great deal, of the innocence of her youth. It was quite evident she could not speak English. She did not have much to say, although I could see that she was filled with fear and a longing for stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319462">My colleague, the Foreign Minister of Jordan, Nasser Judeh, was with me. Nasser translated. I said to ask her how she was doing. We were there to see the well-being of people. I will never forget her answer. She looked in his eyes and said one thing as tears built up in her eyes, “I don't like it here. I want to go home.” That is one small child who in many ways summarizes so much of the problems this crisis has created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319463">Nearly a year later, the sad report is that this young girl's future is no brighter. Families just like hers are arriving by the hundreds, if not the thousands every day. Many nights, 2,000 people flee across the border to Jordan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319464">Camp Zaatari is now the world's second largest refugee camp. It would actually be the fourth largest city in the Kingdom of Jordan, if it were a permanent city. We think of the generosity of the Jordanian people, the Jordanian government, and His Majesty King Abdullah II in allowing people to flee their country to seek refuge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319465">More than two years into this crisis, the situation only continues to grow more desperate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319466">While some might become numb by the endless stream of bad news or be tempted to shut out the details of a situation that only seems to grow more hopeless, it is for the sake of that little girl I just mentioned and for the millions of other people like her that we are compelled to remain actively engaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319467">I would suggest to all hon. members that the only way to end the suffering of the Syrian people is through a political solution to this crisis. We have not gone out of our way to criticize those who are seeking to arm the opposition. If it were only as simple as to provide more guns, more rockets, more bullets, more grenades to bring an end to this crisis, I think it would have already ended a long time ago. However, I have felt for some time that the more arms that flow into that country, the more Assad ratchets up his military power. As bad and evil as the Assad regime has been military-wise, exercising brute force against its own people, it is probably operating only on six of eight cylinders. As bad as it is, these people have only just started. The more well armed the opposition becomes, the more brutal and violent and tough the government gets. It still has the capacity to make it worse. The better armed, better equipped the Free Syrian Army and other regime opponents have become, the more violent and more aggressive the Assad regime has become.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319468">We saw it in Houla last May. We saw it in Daraa last August, and in other places since. Opposition strength to the Assad regime has unleashed a merciless response from that regime. The United Nations Security Council, unfortunately, has failed to effectively tackle this challenge. It is conflicted, but the world is conflicted too. People have different views and are rooting for different sides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319469">I do want to take the opportunity here in this House to congratulate the Arab League for stepping up in a major way to fill this void. It has spoken out loudly and clearly for some time and repeatedly against Assad and the war that he has waged against his own people. The significant efforts expended first by Kofi Annan and then by Lakhdar Brahimi as joint UN and Arab League special envoys unfortunately have not brought about the end to the violence that we seek. For more than a year, I have been speaking to people who personally know Assad, and I have asked them what kind of man he is. These are people who have seen him up close, who have worked with him, people who have sought to seek peace between Syria and Lebanon, at the UN, the International Peace Institute, or other foreign minister colleagues of mine who have worked with him for many years. Just about every single one of them has said that Assad will fight to the bitter end. Unfortunately, I have seen nothing to convince me otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319470">Obviously, we want to see him held accountable for his terrible actions. Last year, I said very clearly that what Assad needs to be facing is the International Criminal Court to face charges for committing crimes against humanity. Having said that, in many respects it will be up to the Syrian people to determine how he is tried and where. It is also up to Syrians to decide what replaces his regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319471">Significant sanctions have come from Canada and like-minded allies or the Arab League. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has also played an effective role. I am very pleased to say Canada for the first time recently appointed a representative to engage with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah. Significant sanctions, while having devastated the Syrian economy, have not proven effective at causing this regime to change course. Assad is waging war against his own people. These sanctions are crippling the Syrian economy and it does not appear that he could care less about the effect of these sanctions. He has some support in the country; whether it is 10%, 20% or 30%, I do not know. He is getting material support from a number of countries, including Iran, which is another reason this government declared it a state sponsor of terrorism. However, the sanctions have not worked.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319472">Canada, I should note, has not at all sat idle. In fact, Canada will be chairing and hosting the next Syria sanctions committee meeting here in Canada. I and others in government have worked very hard with the Friends of the Syrian People International Working Group to develop a united front and aid for the political action against Assad. Canada has helped address the most urgent humanitarian needs within Syria, while also working to assist Syria's neighbours to deal with the crush of refugees and other effects of this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319473">In many respects, this is the worst crisis this century has seen, only 13 years in. Canada, I am pleased to say, has been a world leader, not only in making pledges of financial support but in delivering on those pledges. Canada is well known for that. We are delivering support, aid and humanitarian assistance to the victims of the Assad regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319474">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170592" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> mentioned the crisis in Haiti and compared it to the crisis in Syria. It is hard to compare one crisis with another. I know that in that crisis, in five minutes, a quarter of a million people died. In five minutes, one-quarter of a million human beings lost their lives in our hemisphere. In Syria, Assad has been vicious. The war has had a terrible effect, but it has gone on over a long, protracted period of over two years now. It is hard to compare the humanitarian crisis in Haiti with the slow descent into hell the Syrian people have witnessed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319475">We have pressed countries, such as Russia and China, that have influence with this regime to do all they can to end the bloodshed and support a transition of power. We saw one glimmer of hope in discussions in Geneva, what was called the Geneva declaration or the Geneva initiative, which Russia saw reason to support. We continue to think that it is one element of a political solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319476">We have called for resolutions and have pushed for real action within the United Nations system. While the Security Council has utterly failed, the UN has had some good successes. I would note the great job the United Nations World Food Programme is doing in Syria. Canada, by and large, is generally the second largest contributor to that organization. We have provided financial support to the World Food Programme to support both people inside Syria and those who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319477">Valerie Amos and her staff at the UN have done a phenomenal job with the United Nations' humanitarian response and in getting urgent assistance to those who need it most. I do not mind criticizing the United Nations when I think their actions are wanting, but I am equally proud to say congratulations to the United Nations when they do good and effective work. Frankly, when it comes to the registration of refugees, if the United Nations does not step in to do that, there is really no one else that can fill that void. They have done it, and they have done it well, in my personal, first-hand experience in Syria and Jordan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319478">Canada has, I am pleased to say, helped address the needs throughout the region. Obviously, if we can provide humanitarian support to people in Syria, the four million-odd people who have been internally displaced, they do not have to seek refuge. However, it is hard. It is very hard to get aid to the people who need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319479">Not too long ago, I travelled to Luxembourg, where I and nine other foreign ministers met with 10 international aid organizations: the World Food Programme, other UN bodies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the European humanitarian assistance folks. We talked. I am told by the UN World Food Programme that there are times when for four, five, six or seven days they are not allowed to get food out of Damascus. On the days they can get it out, there are 51 different checkpoints, with two signatures required. It has been brutal. Thirty people, some from the UN, some from other organizations, have lost their lives trying to get help to people within Syria. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="30">(1930)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319480">We have paid particular attention to the pressing needs in Jordan. That has been deliberate. The influx of refugees to Jordan has been nearly overwhelming. To put it in context, my dear friend and colleague, the Foreign Minister of Jordan, Nasser Judeh, put it this way: It is like the entire population of Canada seeking refuge in the United States. Already more than 10%, 11% or 12% of the population of Jordan are Syrian refugees. It causes huge problems in access to water and sanitation. Internal social problems, such as schooling and people taking employment from other Jordanians, are huge. They are significant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319481">The need for food, medicine and other basics have tapped a government that was already experiencing extreme budget pressures. Indeed, Jordan does not have the developed economy some other countries in the region do. It is not resource rich. The average Jordanian can afford just a third of what the average Turk can, for instance. The situation is very different for Jordan than it is for Turkey, and the need is greater than in some other places. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319482">Canada is delivering. I have personally visited all of Syria's neighbours. I am continuously taking stock of what the needs are and what we can do to be of help. Canada is a rare donor country in that it not only pledges to help out, it actually delivers. This is something government colleagues will elaborate on throughout tonight's presentations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319483">My friend from <Affiliation DbId="170592" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> says that we are not doing enough. How could we possibly do enough when we are seeing the biggest humanitarian crisis of the century? Whatever we are doing, it is not enough, and we have to do more. As this crisis drags on, we will do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319484">We know that when it comes to humanitarian assistance, getting people and goods to the places they are most needed is a challenge. The World Food Programme, for instance, is doing a great job, as I mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319485">I am also pleased to report that Canada is at the forefront of thinking about and considering solutions to the challenge of Syria's sizeable stockpile of chemical weapons. We have all seen recent reports, some of them conflicting, about their possible use. While it would appear almost certain that some of these deadly weapons were, in fact, used in recent days, we do not yet know for sure who used them, where they were used and exactly when. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319486">I will leave the rush to judgment to others, but I firmly believe that on a question as important as this, we need precision and clarity. We need to get the facts before responding. President Obama has outlined the importance of this too, and I agree. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319487">About one month ago, we extended a line of credit to the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors to try to get these important answers and elusive facts. Once we get these facts, we will consult with our allies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319488">American leadership will, of course, be key. So too will the actions of other key allies, such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Regional powers, including Turkey and Jordan, will also need to be part of the response. The stakes could not be higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319489">We, responsible nations everywhere, cannot allow these chemical weapons stockpiles to fall into the wrong hands. Even small doses unleashed in tight spaces can wreak havoc and cause mass casualties within minutes. This is a concern from Tel Aviv to Tokyo to Toronto, and all points in between.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319490">Our collective response must be firm. We must speak with one voice on this matter. We must understand that failure is not an option. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319491">While we engage with like-minded states on this important question, we also work and engage with various factions, such as the opposition within Syria. Let us remind ourselves that this is not one homogenous body ready to replace Assad and his thugs, which only complicates an already difficult situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319492">My friend from Toronto has in recent days asked publicly for more information about the makeup of the opposition. Others have asked why we do not recognize them and back them blindly. We have engaged with the opposition. I have met with their leadership. Canadian officials have met with their leadership. We engage with them, whether they be in Istanbul, Cairo or London.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319493">Let me be clear. We have very credible information to suggest that in recent months, the number of Salafists, jihadists, radical extremists and those who express links to al Qaeda has only increased. This was said by my colleague opposite. They have come to Syria, backed by foreign money, to fight other foreign nationals, Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard among them. These are not people seeking peace for Syria. These are people looking to wage new wars based on old hatred in the lawless, ungoverned space that is today's Syria. We have gone from being concerned about whether there will be a place for religious minorities, whether they be Shia, Kurds, Alawites, Christians, Druze or Ismailis, to what we can do to make sure these people are not slaughtered when Assad falls.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319494">It is no longer a “nice to have” notion of pluralism. It is a matter of survival for those who may not appreciate the imposition of Sharia law, Islamic courts and brands of religious extremism that deny women and minorities their basic human dignity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319495">Already we have seen the destabilizing effects in the border areas. I would point to the kidnapping of four UN peacekeepers, Philippine nationals, in recent hours and days. Already we see signs of problems that have worsened over years threatening to get suddenly much worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319496">In conclusion, Canada will work with our allies to deal with all of this as best we can. We appreciate the support of all hon. members as this debate continues tonight and in the days and weeks ahead. I urge everyone to keep in mind the innocent who have been killed or displaced already, those many millions of Syrians who yearn for brighter futures, and perhaps especially the children affected by this crisis, children who simply want to go home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319497">Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his intervention and clarification on some points with regard to the government's actions. However, there are a couple of things I want to tie down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319498">I know that everyone has read the reports. I have some Security Council reports here. I will get into this a bit more, but I note the horrific toll this conflict has had on children and women. Typically, women and children are injured or are refugees as an outcome of war. However, we are now seeing that they are being strategically targeted, and I want to get the government's comment on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319499">I also have a specific question about cluster munitions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319500">The member talked about chemical weapons. We have reports from different sources, going back to March, on the use of cluster munitions. I note that the Conservative government has not come out against the use of cluster munitions or made comment on it. I know that the government is against the use of them, but I want to know why we have not spoken out when it comes to cluster munitions in Syria.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319502">I think we are speaking very loudly and clearly. We have legislation before Parliament right now to sign the international convention. Obviously, Canada feels very strongly about the use of these munitions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319503">The member opposite mentioned women and children. We have put financial resources into UNICEF of more than $2.7 million. UNICEF is on the ground in the refugee camps. We realize the anger and frustration in these camps. People have had to leave their homes, and the huge effect it has on children is self-evident. I ended my comments on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319504">The member also mentioned women. We are increasingly seeing around the world rape being used as a weapon of war. There are significant and serious reports from Syria. This is an issue about which Canada and our allies have spoken loudly and clearly. We are putting financial resources on the table for other conflicts, and we are more than prepared to do that here. We spoke at the G8 ministers meeting, where the United Kingdom made this a centrepiece. Canada put up millions of dollars in new financial resources, and it is something we are keen to be engaged with in Syria. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319506">Mr. Speaker, just a few months ago there was a delegation of Syrian Canadians from the community who were going through the hallways and talking to a lot of us. Some met with the minister. One of things they were asking for was the guiding principles and rationale, where helping people in desperate circumstances is part of Canada's proud humanitarian tradition. Canada has always played an important international role in alleviating problems and finding solutions to the plight of diaspora world-wide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319507">Our recent and distant Canadian history is full of generous and brave actions to resettle refugees from crisis zones world-wide, from 60,000 Vietnamese, to 20,000 Iraqis, to all kinds of special measures, to uplift more than 5,000 Kosovar refugees in 1999, the Lebanese immigration refugee wave of the seventies, and other bright examples of principles and successful policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319508">The minister spoke about what he has seen, the girl and everything that he visited. The question that has been put to the government time and time again is, is Canada running any special programs for Syrian refugees? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319509">I took the liberty of communicating with the Canadian embassy in Amman and the Canadian embassy in Beirut. After three tries, I received an answer to my question. Many of my constituents are asking if we are running any special programs for Syrian refugees. Lo and behold, surprise, I figured that the government would. The minister is going to Turkey and saying, “we are taking refugees and we are doing this”. The answer is at this time there are no, I repeat, no special programs for Syrian refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319510">If the minister would give his crocodile tears today about the girl that he met, why is he not working with his colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> to make sure that there is yes, a Syrian refugee program? He can continue, but the answer will still be no. When are the Conservatives going to do something about it?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319527">Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart, like many in this place, as we debate again the situation in Syria. I say “again” because we have dealt with the issue before. Some things have changed, but obviously not enough, as we have heard from our colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319528">When we hear of the deaths of 70,000, refugee numbers of 1.5 million, 4.25 million displaced and 6.8 million in need of humanitarian assistance, it is really hard to get our heads around this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319529">We understand there is a desperate need for humanitarian assistance. We understand that the refugee crisis is getting worse. We understand that we have a government in Damascus that is deciding to stay put and continue with its crimes against humanity. We understand that there is a civil war that is getting worse in many ways. However, we have to understand what we can do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319530">All too often in our parliaments and our legislatures around the world we are given all the reasons why we cannot do things. If we just take a look at the first three months of 2013, the number of Syrian refugees more than doubled because we, seemingly, could not figure out what to do. Let us remember, this is a conflict that has been going on for a couple of years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319531">In January, there were around 500,000 refugees. By April, there were more than 1.3 million who fled to neighbouring countries, as we have heard. The United Nations refugee council is saying that it registers 7,000 new refugees every day. More than 440,000 Syrians have fled to Lebanon. Syrian refugees now make up more than 10% of its population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319532">We also know the burden that has on other countries. Therefore, what we have to do is understand what is possible. I am going to touch on some of the issues that have brought us to this point, but let us go back to last October. That is when the foreign affairs committee was seized with this issue. Frankly, it was our party that pushed to have hearings on Syria and the government agreed, which was helpful. We did a study at the foreign affairs committee because we needed to better understand from Syrian Canadians, from experts and certainly from the government, what we were doing and what we could be doing. From that study we put forward a motion to ask the government to do a couple of things. One was to deal with family reunification, to fast-track those Syrians stuck in the refugee camps who had fled the slaughter in Syria to be sponsored by family members here in Canada. The other thing we asked was to increase humanitarian support, particularly in Turkey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319533">I listened carefully to the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, who quite rightly noted that there is a burden on Jordan to take in so many refugees. It is a country that is not as well off, certainly, as Canada. He mentioned helping Lebanon as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319534">However, it is important to underline here that out of that committee report came a motion that was debated in the House. We underlined the importance of Turkey. I am critical of the government for not following up on both of those suggestions because when it comes to refugees and reunification, his colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation>, made an announcement in Turkey to suggest that we were going to take in 5,000 refugees. This was good news for many of us when we first heard it. Sadly, we found out when we looked into the announcement that it was not for Syrian refugees leaving the slaughter in Syria, it was for refugees who had already been documented from other countries. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319535">We do have a proud tradition in this country of accommodating and helping people who are fleeing strife, be it natural disaster in Haiti, as was mentioned, conflict like Lebanon in the 1980s or the infamous stories of those who fled Southeast Asia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I have heard the minister tonight say he will talk to his colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation>. I do not understand why the minister himself, on two occasions, did not meet with the community when asked to. I am talking about the minister's colleague, not the minister. I look forward to his following up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319536">However, the other thing that has to be noted in this debate tonight, going back to my comments, is that we are all seized with this issue and often paralyzed because we do not believe there is anything more we can do. This is something we can do. We have Syrian Canadian families right now who want to help their family members. Members should think of it right now as if it was their family member who fled conflict. If members could help them out, they would do it. That is all these people are asking for. That is all we are asking for. That is why people have signed the petition asking the government to do just that, to meet with members of the community and to open our doors and our hearts to people fleeing the slaughter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319537">We need to do more and, in the spirit of having a debate where we are focused on concrete solutions, we need to acknowledge, as in my intervention with the minister, the burden this has been particularly on children. There are UN officials who have said that children and women are on the front lines of this war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319538"> I mentioned in October that we had committee hearings on Syria, and we heard from Syrian Canadians and from experts. We heard from Mariam Hamou, a very proud Syrian Canadian woman, and I think anyone who was at the committee will remember her testimony in particular because it was so human.

              <ParaText id="3319546">With that in mind, I have spoken, as we all have, to Syrian Canadians and others, including experts. In fact, I just spoke with someone who is out of Washington today, but whose expertise is around peace, security and women, which is the issue for our century to look at. The issue is how we can ensure that women are not on the front lines of the conflict but are also involved in making sure we find peace, because all too often they are the victims and not allowed in, so to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319547">To that end, not only does the NDP want the government to fast-track family members and increase aid, particularly to countries like Turkey where we should do more, but also focus on women. To that end, New Democrats want the government to engage with the Syrian Women's Network. This is a group of women, civil society members and leaders, working to ensure they can do everything they can to help civilians right now, not only in the camps but in Syria, and to strengthen the hope that everyone had at the beginning of this two years ago that there are going to be opportunities for all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319548">That is something Canada can do, and we should do it in the following framework. We should do it by saying that our government will lead by engaging Syrian Canadians, those who have expertise and, as I said in my comments earlier, who have already spent their own money to help people on the ground. Some have gone into the conflict zones themselves not to wage war but to work in makeshift hospitals, deliver food aid, help kids, to do what they can with what they have the best way they can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319549">To that end, New Democrats want the government to have a particular focus on women, work with the Syrian Women's Network and look at putting together a network of Syrian Canadians who will be able to strengthen civil society and opportunities for a lasting political solution. Make no mistake, if tomorrow there were an end to the conflict as we see it now, it does not mean peace and stability. It means that the next phase will happen. As Canadians, we have to make sure we are doing everything we can to prepare for what the next steps are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319550">It is clear when we look at what happened in Iraq and even in Libya that we must ensure we are ready and prepared to help on the ground when things change, with basic things such as water and sewage, ensuring basic services are met and basic governance. I know, the minister knows and everyone in the House knows that there are Syrian Canadians who are willing and able to do that. We can work with women's organizations, the Syrian Women's Network and Syrian Canadians, coordinate their efforts, both human resources and money, to look at how we can help immediately on the ground, to strengthen the institutions that are already doing work through the UN and others, and to start looking at what Canada's role will be when this conflict ends. Every conflict ends. Every war ends. It is just a matter of when it ends. Then the question is what we do about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319551">I know the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> is a fan of Churchill. During the Second World War, which my father served in overseas, in 1942, I believe it was, he was already planning for what would happen in post-war Germany. He had some of the best and the brightest looking at what needs and services would be required and who would be able to fill that role. It was because he understood that wars and conflicts end. Then the question was what to do and what one's contribution would be. The question is: What is Canada's contribution going to be?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319552">We should look at the challenges we face, such as who is being affected by this war and the huge toll this has taken on civilians, particularly women and children, as I have underlined in my comments. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319553">Just to give an example of what this means for women, not only are they affected by becoming refugees and having to leave their homes and take care of their children without enough resources to support them, but we have evidence that there are as many as 6,400 women who have been detained by the regime. One thousand of them are university students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319554">Let us remember who started this movement. This was not malicious, from outside. This was not people who picked up arms. This was a peaceful movement of young people—not entirely but primarily—who decided they wanted a different Syria. They led, in this response to the government's crackdown, by protesting peacefully, not by picking up guns, not by using any so-called terrorist methods. They simply used their passion, their hearts and their drive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319555">What has happened is that many of them have been killed and many of them have been detained. We understand that Syrian women and children who have been affected are targeted, as I read in this testimony. Can members imagine targeting schools? Many of us have worked as teachers or have kids, and we all grew up and went through the system. To think that someone is actually targeting a school is beyond comprehension. It is a horror. That is why I think we should be engaging to do more with those who have been engaged on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319556"> I want to finish up by saying, while the world watches what happens in Syria and wonders what else we can do, let us remember what this country has done in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319557">I remember a story of a couple who were over here in the Laurentian Mountains for a weekend. They were horrified as they watched South Asians in boats and saw the news reports. They saw that they were in peril, that they needed help, and the world was not opening its doors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319558">That couple came back to this city and they got in touch with the government. They held some public meetings, and they opened the minds of the government of the day, which was a Conservative government. They said we must do more. They held local meetings where people—church groups, bowling teams and others—sponsored refugees, to help those people who were on the high seas and who were being left behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319559">That couple was my parents. My mother was the mayor of Ottawa at the time. It was a grassroots movement that said that as Canadians we have something to do. She called it Project 4000. It opened the doors to 4,000 Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian refugees here in this city, and challenged every other mayor across the country to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319560">We went from having a quota of 8,000 refugees for that year. Because of grass roots and because Canadians mobilized and said we could do something about this, it changed to 60,000. It was Flora MacDonald who was the minister who did that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319561">I say to the government and to Canadians that we can do more, we can do it together and we can show Syrians that we are here to help with that. We can say to the world that Canada cannot solve the problem, but we can do our bit. I think if we support refugees, if we do a little more in humanitarian support, and we decide that we are going to engage all Syrians who can help with civil society, with women, supporting women in particular, Canada will be proud of what it can do in a horrific, awful conflict.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319562">Mr. Speaker, we have had three speakers in this debate, the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, the Liberal Foreign Affairs critic, and now the NDP Foreign Affairs critic, and all of them have very passionately stated the human tragedy that is taking place in Syria. There is no question about it. All three have said that what is happening in Syria is totally unacceptable, and that is not just the war, but the misery that is going on there. All of them have given their personal examples to say and show where all these things are leading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319563">It is understandable that my colleague talks about engaging with the Canadian Syrian community, and that is indeed what we should be doing and indeed what this government is doing. I am sure all opposition members are engaged with the Syrian Canadian community, who because of their own personal interests have tremendous contributions they can make toward the tragic situation in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319564">The NDP critic talked about engaging women's networks and setting that up, but at this time the security situation in Syria is disastrous. There is no room for civil society there. There is no room for people to do anything. What we need right now is to bring, as quickly as possible, pressure to stop the civil war, to stop the killing. Only then can we have these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319565">I understand what he is talking about, that we want to build this thing—Mr. Speaker, we have 10 minutes for questions, so let me go.</ParaText>

I acknowledge the announcements that the government has made and the money it has invested in helping refugees, et cetera, but there is more that we have to do. This is not a partisan issue. This is about our country and what we can do. That is what this debate is about. It is about informing and sharing ideas, and hopefully coming up with the next steps in terms of what we can do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319570">I would acknowledge that the government, particularly at the beginning, has donated and invested money in the plight of refugees. I am saying that Canadians want to do even more. Let us use that opportunity. Let us engage with Canadians and do even more. Let us understand that this conflict has taken a huge hit on women and children, and we need to look at their plight and invest with them. It sounds like the parliamentary secretary agrees with me, so I look forward to the government's response on that, as well as with the fast-tracking of refugees.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319571">Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of this situation in Syria, we from this side, the community and NGOs, are asking the government to match dollar-for-dollar what they raise. This has been done for many occasions. It was done for the earthquake in Gujarat. It was done for the tsunami. It was done for the earthquake in 2005 in Pakistan, and it continues. The government even reluctantly a couple of times went ahead and did that. I remember the time that we had the earthquake in China, and we had to push the minister at that time. Of course, we forgot the $16 orange juice. We had to push her and push the government in order to do this. When Haiti happened, this House was locked down and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> walked right across and said “Here is my donation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319572">In that spirit that the community has been asking, that the NGOs have been asking, that we in the opposition have been asking, will my hon. colleague agree that the government has failed completely to match dollar-for-dollar the request from the community? The government is ignoring the Syrian community in Canada, in not only not matching dollar-for-dollar, but also the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> not meeting with them following request after request, in writing to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who is not ordering his ministers to meet with them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319578">Mr. Speaker, I mentioned some of this in my comments. In October of last year, we decided it was important to actually have the foreign affairs committee, of which I am a vice-chair, study what is happening in Syria and hear directly from people. I read some of the testimony into the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319579">From that, we got some good ideas about what we should do next. We had a motion and we debated it in the House, and as she mentioned, the motion was passed unanimously. It said three things. One was to acknowledge and support the UN mission, which was already touched on by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170592" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>. That was Mr. Brahimi's mission. We noted that they were not going to find a peace accord tomorrow, but it was important to have UN presence there for all sorts of reasons, the least of which is for what happens when the conflict is over. It will be important to have knowledge of what is happening on the ground when the conflict is over. The second point was to have the fast-tracking of refugees. Thirdly, we said to provide more humanitarian support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319580">This was agreed to by the House. I simply remind the government that on two of these issues, it still needs to do more. We encourage the government to do more.</ParaText>

Diplomacy should be ramped up and we should ensure that our friends in Russia get the message yet again that it has a role here. It has been supplying arms, everyone knows that, and if this continues, it will be even more culpable than it was before.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319588">Mr. Speaker, Syrians are facing an increasingly desperate situation. More than 80,000 Syrians have been killed so far. Some 4.25 million people have been internally displaced, and over 1.4 million have become refugees. The situation ranks as one of the worst humanitarian disasters on the planet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319589">In our view, the best and perhaps the only hope to end the suffering of all Syrians is a political solution that would see Assad go, his regime making way for an inclusive Syrian-led transition to a new Syria in which all Syrians' rights are protected and where stability and democracy can thrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319590"> This ideal is a long way from becoming a reality at this time. It requires a united opposition that will be able to extend its authority over all actors inside Syria, an opposition that is inclusive of minorities, rejects terrorism and extremism, and is committed to building a stable, democratic, pluralistic state for all Syrians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319591">However, again, that is a long way off. As the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> noted earlier, the arrival of Salafists, jihadists and people with links to al Qaeda from other countries in even greater numbers only makes the challenge more difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319592">The Syrian Opposition Coalition, or SOC, has made some progress in its attempt to safeguard pluralism and a role for all citizens. The SOC was formed in November of last year in an effort to unite the main factions of the political opposition in a structure that could speak with a single voice. It is an important interlocutor for the international community and is slowly taking steps to bring order out of chaos in parts of Syria it claims to control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319593"> However, much more needs to be done. The SOC continues to struggle with disunity and internal cohesion. In particular, moderates and ethnic and religious minorities do not yet feel adequately represented in the SOC. This is a matter of great concern to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319594">If the opposition is to turn the page on the tyranny of the Assad regime, it must demonstrate to members of Syria's minority communities that they have a place in the Syrian opposition, that they will have a place in the new Syria, and that their rights will be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319595">Canada also urges the SOC to do more to condemn terrorism and extremism unequivocally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319596">The proliferation of extremist groups on the ground and an influx of foreign fighters have been of growing concern since the conflict in Syria began. Most deadly among these groups is Jabhat al-Nusra, or JN. Just last month, al Qaeda in Iraq, AQI, announced its merger with JN. We had long been aware of JN's links to AQI, but these had never previously been declared publicly. There is little sympathy among the people of Syria for JN's extreme brand of Islam. In fact, JN was quick to deny the merger, although it still pledged allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319606">Mr. Speaker, once free of Assad's iron grip, the people of Syria must not find themselves further suppressed by those who seek to impose a new tyranny, create sectarian strife, or threaten Syria's neighbours. The opposition must do more to marginalize and weed out extremists. We, as responsible nations, must think long and hard before we consider arming the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319607"> As retired Lieutenant-General Andrew Leslie said in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, “once you flood the area with such weapons, you have no idea where they'll end up, and no way of getting them back”. He said it is “the last thing you want to do”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319608">We agree with him 100%. Certainly Canada has been very clear from the outset of this crisis that we would take a deliberate, considerate and thoughtful approach to all matters relating to support for the Syrian opposition, even if it means that we stand alone among friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319609">The situation in Syria is unlike conflict in other places in recent years. It is extremely complex and it is ever changing. While some members opposite would have us rush blindly to recognize the Syrian opposition just because other countries have done so, Canada, under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> have said, “Hang on. Let's exercise the appropriate caution and due diligence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319610">That decision seems more wise the longer that this conflict drags on. Until and unless the SOC becomes more inclusive and does more to reject extremism, Canada will not recognize this body as the legitimate representative of all Syrians. However, this does not mean that we ignore those in the opposition who are truly committed to a better and brighter new Syria for all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319611">We continue to engage Syrian opposition actors at all levels. The <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> himself has met with Syrian opposition leaders, both here in Ottawa and in the capitals around the world. In December of last year, he appointed a new representative to the Syrian opposition, based in Cairo. We do this to get the best possible first-hand information. We use such opportunities to push for an end to the violence, for a political solution to the conflict, and for a Syrian-led transition to a stable, democratic and pluralistic Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319612">In the new Syria there can be no room for terror and oppression. Respect for basic rights and human dignity must reign. To that end, Canada has actively supported civil administration by grassroots actors who have stepped up to run their own communities in the liberated areas where the regime is no longer providing services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319613">We have supported accountability efforts to help ensure that reports of war crimes, including cases of rape as a tool of war, can be investigated and that those responsible can eventually be brought to justice. We have supported independent media, which is vital, not only so the Syrians and the international community know the truth of what is occurring in Syria today but as a cornerstone of a future democratic state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319614">The international community must redouble efforts to support moderate influences in the Syrian opposition. Our government knows this. Canadians know this. We know the value of a functioning pluralistic society because we are fortunate to live in one. We must support those moderate democratic opposition forces that respect the rights of all religions and ethnic groups. These are the people who will help to create a new Syria in which all Syrians can truly participate and prosper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319615">The human toll in Syria has been tremendous, and the sacrifice of the opposition has been great. However, the future can be greater.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319616"> Canada will continue to work with those who are truly committed to supporting the best interests of all Syrians, as they work toward building for themselves a better and brighter future.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3319634">Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to participate in this most important debate on the crisis in Syria. This is the third time that we have met into the late hours of an evening to discuss this issue, the last time being just five months ago. Sadly, Assad continues to wage war on his very own people and the regime's depravity reaches new heights each and every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319635">As focused as we are and should be on the grave and deadly situation facing the Syrian people who are being victimized daily by their own government, the regional implications of this crisis are equally troubling for Canada and for the entire international community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319636">The war has spilled over into neighbouring countries in many different ways, and it risks fueling broader regional instability. There are now more than 1.4 million refugees spread across Syria's neighbours, and that number is climbing every day. Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan have borne the brunt of the burden, and they should be commended for their generosity in hosting the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have fled the carnage. It has been no easy task accommodating such a large influx of desperate people fleeing for their lives, often with little more than the clothes on their backs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319637">As the minister mentioned in his remarks, the situation in Jordan is particularly challenging. Zaatari refugee camp, constructed to hold 60,000 refugees, now houses more than 100,000, with more arriving every day. According to the UN, it is the second-largest refugee camp in the world. In total, Jordan has taken in around 500,000 refugees, with estimates suggesting that the number could reach 1.2 million by the end of this year. This would equal around one-fifth of Jordan's population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319638">The international community is doing what it can to alleviate the burden, and our government continues to do its part. In Jordan, for example, our support directly to the Jordanian armed forces has helped them cope with the refugee situation and prepare them for the risk of chemical weapon usage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319639">In Turkey, our contribution has provided food, water, shelter and winter clothing to as many as 170,000 displaced people at the border. Just this past January, I had the opportunity to visit two of those refugee camps in Turkey, along with the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation>. In one camp 25,000 people were living in containers. In another camp 15,000 people were living in tents. The Turkish government was taking very good care of those people: they were being provided with the necessary shelter, food, education for their children, prayer rooms to pray in, and craft facilities to continue to make their crafts in their traditional ways. They were being well cared for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319640">While we were there, Canada announced further contributions to the support of those refugees in Turkey through the International Red Crescent Society. We met with the head of the International Red Crescent Society in Turkey, who was very pleased with what Canada had offered. We met with Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs, who also thanked Canada for its contribution. We met with the chief representative of the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who asked Canada to continue to support the refugees in those camps but not to bring them out of those camps to Canada at this time because the preference is for those people to go back to their homes when the conflict is over. The international community accepts this as a norm. It does not want any minority groups to be depopulated from a country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319641">Our hope is always that people will go back to their homes and be able to resume their normal lives. However, if that does not happen when the conflict is over and if people are still in fear for their lives, then of course the international community, including Canada, will resettle those people in other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319642">The refugee burden and the humanitarian needs created by it are only one of the many regional challenges posed by this war. The spillover of this conflict into Syria's neighbours poses real risk to the stability of a very volatile part of the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319643">We are obviously deeply concerned by the number of cross-border military incidents in this war. Syrian shelling into Turkey and the outbreak of street fighting in Lebanon between factions supporting one side or the other of the Syrian conflict, for example, have tested the patience and at times the stability of Syria's neighbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319644">The risk to Israel cannot be ignored, particularly given reports surfacing today that the Syrian government has authorized groups supporting it to launch attacks on Israel across the Golan Heights. We strongly believe that Israel has a right to defend itself and its people from terrorist threats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319645">While the risk of spillover conflict has been contained for now, the region is on alert. The longer this war continues, the greater the risk of regional escalation. Working through NATO, we supported our ally, Turkey, in its efforts to bolster its defensive capabilities, including through the deployment of Patriot missile batteries. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="35">(2035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319646">One thing is clear: Assad's desperation deepens, and he is not alone in this fight. Standing behind him offering immediate and valuable support are Hezbollah and its principal patron, Iran. Together, Iran and Hezbollah have given Assad important assistance and a needed boost to morale leaving the regime less vulnerable and isolated than it otherwise would have been. By bolstering the regime's capability, resilience and intransigence, Iran and Hezbollah have Syrian blood on their hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319647">While troubling, the involvement of both is not surprising. Iran and Hezbollah have track records that are fully consistent with the kind of deadly destabilizing role they are playing in Syria. Hezbollah have their fingerprints on terrorist outrages across the globe. Hezbollah is, plain and simple, a terrorist organization. We have listed it as such and we have urged other countries to do the same. The Iranian regime, too, has again shown its true colours in Syria. Desperate to ensure the survival of one of its few remaining allies, Iran has provided support and encouragement to Assad. Having brutally crushed its own democracy movement in 2009, Iran has now taken on the Syrian people and their quest for freedom. The Iranian regime has always been about oppression. Its backing of the Assad tyranny provides yet again clear evidence of the despicable and brutal nature of that regime. While we are confident that the new Syria, when it has finally won its freedom, will reject the views and goals of al Qaeda, it could be a deadly and long struggle against an entity bolstered by its successes in Syria. This will be a challenge for the region as a whole going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319648">Our government has been consistent and clear. We have urged the opposition and the Free Syrian Army to distance themselves from this kind of sectarianism and the terrorists who use it, and instead embrace fully the tradition of diversity and tolerance that has marked Syrian history for millennia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319649">The war in Syria is a test for the region and Syria's neighbours are on the front line. The risks are plenty and the longer the war continues, the greater the challenges will be. Canada will continue to watch these events closely, and we will do our part to ensure that the stability of the region is not threatened.</ParaText>

CIDA is supporting NGOs that treat the victims of such violence, hear their stories, document their stories and ensure that those stories can be brought forward for justice through the International Criminal Court when this crisis ends. Canada will continue to do everything possible to protect the vulnerable through humanitarian aid to the Syrian refugee camps and through a special program to support women and children who have been exposed to that kind of violence. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319664">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to a topic we debated in the House a year ago. At the time, 9,000 people had died and a few thousand people had been displaced. Today, the situation is even more grim: 70,000 people have died and there are more than 1.4 million refugees. In Syria, 4.2 million people have been displaced within the country. These figures are from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319665">The conflict is spreading throughout the region. Syria is becoming a ticking time bomb, and an entire region, which is already very unstable, is at risk of falling into an unending spiral of violence. The number of victims is growing. Jihadists are gradually overtaking the restrained political-military opposition, and a regional political-religious system would certainly not be a good idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319666">Groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, which appears to have ties to al Qaeda, or Al-Tali'a, among dozens of other Salafist groups, are growing in power. They come from all over and want to create an Islamic emirate. On the other side, Bashar al-Assad's forces are receiving increased support through the heightened presence of Hezbollah, funded by Iran, which raises concerns about an interfaith war based on the Sunni-Shiite conflict, which would be very detrimental to peace in Syria and in other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319667">This presents a very complicated ethical dilemma for us. The dangers of inaction and the dangers of intervention are uncertain, but in the meantime, people are suffering. We must put these people first when we are deciding whether to act. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> already mentioned this, but I think it is worth repeating. The countries surrounding Syria are receiving countless numbers of refugees, but this government is not doing anything and is refusing to expedite the reunification process for Syrian families, as we did in the past for Haiti. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319668">I want to remind the government that the House voted on a resolution to take two simple actions: increase humanitarian aid for refugees and speed up the processing time for family reunification. There should also be an emphasis on providing support to the UN mission. It is important to know that when the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development conducted its study, it learned that the government would not be renewing its contribution to the mission. It is also important to mention that the government did in fact vote in favour of that mission. This government's modus operandi is inaction, not action, as the minister claimed in his speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319669">Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey are the countries currently receiving the most refugees. In Turkey alone, four new camps are currently being built. Turkey is even building schools for refugee children. We can all agree that the countries that are welcoming all these refugees are seriously lacking resources, and Canada has a leadership role to play in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319670">On April 25, Jordan sent a letter to the Security Council. The letter mentioned that the massive influx of refugees was threatening the security and stability of the country, and could also have an impact on international peace and security. The crush of refugees in Lebanon could also destabilize the country at a time when armed conflict already regularly opposes supporters and opponents of the Syrian regime in Tripoli in northern Lebanon, where religious divisions follow conflict lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319671">When is this government going to provide more aid as pressure on these countries keeps mounting? These countries need a program for refugees. We have to help them cope with the burden of the Syrian conflict. It is ridiculous that we keeping talking about a conflict without ever actually doing anything. This would be a good way to help the neighbouring countries, and also the Syrians. I just want to point out that the Syrian National Council's main request is to reunite the families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319672">The government is quite inept at foreign affairs, starting with its inability to get a seat at the United Nations Security Council.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="45">(2045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319673">As my colleague already mentioned, this council deals with, manages and tries to resolve these types of crises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319674">Even worse, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> and I asked the minister last week about the fact that Canada would not apply for a seat for fear of a humiliating loss. This government's ineptitude has even made it impossible to apply for a seat. It is important to mention this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319675">Let us be clear. If Canada truly wanted to show leadership in resolving the Syrian crisis, the government should have known that having a seat at the table was the best way to do it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319676">Today, John Kerry went to Russia to talk about recent events in Syria. I call that active diplomacy. An NDP government would be on the ground and a member of international decision-making bodies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319677">I wonder what our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and our <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> are doing in the meantime to increase the pressure on Russia and China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319678">As I have already said in the House, and I am going to repeat it, some meetings have already been held. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319679">The first time that I gave a speech on this crisis, I said that the government was putting its economic relations with powers such as Russia and China ahead of diplomatic relations. Diplomatic relations can resolve conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319680">The minister said that we need a political solution. I would really like to see the minister take his responsibilities seriously and find a political solution to this conflict. That is not at all what we have seen this past year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319681">We also know that the government has cut funding for Canadian organizations that could have helped because of their expertise in democracy and human rights, for example. Canada could have been a leader in mapping out the transition to democracy in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319682">Is the government really ready to support democratic development once the conflict in Syria has ended? We sometimes have our doubts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319683"> As I said, organizations like Rights and Democracy and the Global Peace and Security Fund, for example, which advocate for these kinds of principles, have had their programs eliminated. Why? We may well wonder about Canada’s desire to genuinely help Syria return to stability, but above all achieve democracy. For a country that has lived under a dictatorship, it is very important to have the advice of Canadian experts who are recognized worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319684"> This need clearly exists. So why have successive Conservative budgets signed the death warrants for organizations like Rights and Democracy and jeopardized the financial viability of the Global Peace and Security Fund? Why has the government undermined Canada’s capacity to be a leader on the international scene? These questions need to be asked in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319685"> The NDP continues to call on the government to prioritize protecting civilians, in co-operation with international organizations on the ground like the United Nations and the Syrian humanitarian organizations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319686"> I reiterate that Canada has to work with the Arab League and the United Nations on peace efforts, emergency humanitarian aid and accelerating the family reunification process for Syrians with family in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319687"> I have to address the situation of women and children in this conflict. As the rhetoric surrounding the use of chemical weapons in Syria heats up, the systematic use of sexual violence as a tactic of war is generating relatively little concern, if any. There are organizations collecting data about the sexual assaults being perpetrated in Syria. Unfortunately, a number of international human rights NGOs report that cases of rape are constantly being reported in the refugee camps. Senior representatives of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that the Syrian conflict was bringing with it a large number of gender-based crimes, as well as the intentional victimization of women and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319688"> It is therefore extremely important to point out that there is a humanitarian crisis and there are glaring needs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319689"> We are talking about women who are being raped. We do not have to be familiar with these individuals’ culture to know how rape can destroy the soul of a community and a culture. That is precisely the reason why sexual violence is used as a weapon of war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319690"> The reports tell us that the conflict is getting worse. Rape and sexual violence are being used as weapons of war to intimidate adversaries in the conflict, in order to destroy dignity, identity and the social fabric, and in fact to suppress any kind of challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319691"> Some of the women questioned by the NGOs have reported rape and other forms of sexual violence committed by the pro-government forces when homes are searched, after arrests at checkpoints, and when women are in detention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319692"> My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> read the moving testimony of a woman who testified as an individual before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, and we have seen how out of control the situation has become. Something has got to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319693"> Some accounts report crimes of this kind committed by armed anti-government groups. Many of the people questioned also talked about the risk of women being abducted by all of the parties to the conflict to get information that could be traded for the release of certain prisoners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319694"> Some women who appeared before the International Federation for Human Rights said that most of them were subsequently excluded. According to several women and organizations offering support services, families sometimes force rape survivors to marry in order to save the family's honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319695"> The risks the survivors run of being stigmatized and rejected impose a culture of silence that prevents women from reporting the sex crimes they have suffered. Consequently, many of those who need medical and psychosocial support unfortunately do not have access to it. I mentioned in my previous speech that this was a need and that the refugees in the Syrian camps were already desperately lacking support a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319696"> The situation is not getting any better, and it is really time the Conservatives decided to act. We must ensure that adequate funding follows in order to provide front-line services for the refugees’ safety and physical and mental health. Post-conflict psychosocial problems tend to be long-lasting, and trauma is transmitted from the mother to the children in the family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319697"> The conflict must therefore be resolved, but provision must also be made for a long-term solution. The mass rape of women as a weapon of war and the trauma the children have suffered are among the problems needing a long-term solution. We have a duty to provide for the protection of refugees, and women and children alone account for 50% of those refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319698"> A UNICEF report entitled <I>Syria's Children: A lost generation? </I>describes the conflict's direct impact on the country's children, who have been traumatized by seeing members of their families raped and killed before their very eyes. They are terrified by the sounds and scenes of conflict. A simple noise can suddenly make them relive a bombing. Diseases of the skin and respiratory tract are on the rise, and one school in five has been destroyed or damaged or is being used to house displaced families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319699"> Children run the greatest risk of having their rights violated. They are being mutilated, killed, orphaned or sexually assaulted by rival factions. They are frequently seized by rebel forces at checkpoints and forced into combat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319700"> This state of affairs greatly saddens me. Talking about it today makes me realize how important it is for us to discuss it and to look at measures taken by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319701"> This is a cry of hope for Syrians. The government must act and use what little international weight it has left to try to put pressure on Syria or China.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319702">We need to find a political solution to end this crisis. That is what the minister said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319703">I am asking him and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to please do something. We need to stop watching this situation fester and worsen. Something needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319704">The long-term consequences are potentially disastrous for a region that is already extremely unstable. It is no longer a question of simply intervening for the children. Practically an entire generation will be traumatized and shattered. After the conflict—and I hope that day is coming—we will need to think about those children and the help they will need. I am begging the government to stop cuts to organizations, such as Rights and Democracy, that exist for that purpose and work for peace and security. Honestly, given the Conservative government's record, how can we believe that it really wants to help?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319705">There is a lot of bad news coming out of Syria: a number of other countries are intervening in the conflict, there are allegations of the use of chemical weapons and UN peacekeepers have been kidnapped. The conflict seems to have reached a point of no return, and it could spill over the borders and become a regional conflict. As the minister said, it is crucial to find a political solution to this conflict so that a long-term peace process can be implemented with the help of the UN.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319706">Today, I received calls and emails from people asking me to mention the following three points. First, they want their government to take a key role on the international stage to determine a peace process for Syria. Second, they want their government to increase humanitarian aid and support for refugees. Third, they want their government to help reunite families of Syrian-born Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319738">There is increasing use of heavy weapons in populated areas by both sides, leading to extensive destruction of infrastructure and massive loss of life. The International Committee of the Red Cross has described the current situation in Syria as nothing short of catastrophic. Countless homes, clinics, hospitals and other essential infrastructure, such as water and sanitation systems, have been destroyed or severely damaged. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319739">Civilians continue to be in the line of fire from this violent civil war. At this point, more people have been killed in the conflict since the start of this year than in the entire first year of the conflict. According to UNHCR, it is estimated that at least 80,000 people have died in the fighting, with many thousands of people wounded. In fact, while initially the number of monthly casualties was 1,000 per month in mid-2011, by July 2012, that number had risen to 5,000 per month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319740">As of today, nearly one and a half million Syrians have taken refuge in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The conflict and the humanitarian situation are deteriorating rapidly as violence intensifies and fighting continues throughout the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319741">Violence has spread to Damascus and other new, densely populated urban areas. This has led to increasing levels of destruction, casualties and displacement. The number of people affected by the crisis who are in need of humanitarian assistance is estimated to be more than 6.8 million. Within Syria itself, an estimated 4.25 million people have been displaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319742">The strain on communities hosting refugees is compounding the other challenges they have. Tension between refugees and host communities is on the rise, mainly because of competition over jobs, housing and services. In both Lebanon and Jordan, energy, water, health and education services are strained to the limit from hosting the Syrian refugees. Both Lebanese and Jordanians are already facing high unemployment, high prices and poverty, so we can imagine how potentially volatile the situation is becoming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319743">Canada stepped up to the plate to help. On January 30, at the high-level pledging conference in Kuwait, the <Affiliation DbId="184400" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> announced additional humanitarian support from Canada to help those affected by the conflict. He also made it clear that Canada continues to support the efforts of the international community to bring about an end to the violence. However, he stated that humanitarian assistance is not enough. A political solution to end the ongoing conflict must be found. Canada has repeatedly called on all parties to end the violence. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319745">Humanitarian workers are making heroic efforts to meet the urgent needs of those affected by the violence. We commend their courageous efforts. They are placing their own lives at risk in order to provide life-saving assistance to those affected by the violence. However, these efforts continue to be obstructed. Even humanitarian actors are not immune to the violence and a number have laid down their lives in their efforts to save others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319746">Delivery of assistance continues to be precarious and constrained by security issues. As a result, several areas have been deprived of humanitarian assistance either because of the violence or because they have been denied access by both government and opposition groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319747">Fighting in areas of humanitarian operations and places where relief supplies are stored remains a challenge. That is why Canada is providing operational support to the UN, to ensure adequate security measures are in place to provide humanitarian assistance and improve safety for humanitarian staff.

I would like to begin by making a clarification. Some members seem to be confused when I spoke earlier. I did not say there was a program for refugees from Syria. I said that Canada supports and respects the international consensus, which I assume they all know about, which is reflected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' recommendation that resettlement of Syrian refugees not take place at this time because they deem it to be too early in the crisis for other durable solutions to be ruled out and they cannot begin to address the scale of the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319753"> It is a commonly understood and internationally agreed recommendation that when a country is in a crisis, we do not automatically resettle the refugees. We want them to go to their homes once the crisis has ended. We are hoping that this crisis will end and those people will be able to return to their home. We do not want Syria to be depopulated by any minority groups.</ParaText>

It seems that, had we been able to avoid continuing bombardment and move to a peace process, we might have been able to secure those warehouses full of weapons.

              <ParaText id="3319759">Mr. Speaker, I think it is great that all members of Parliament from all parties in this House have an opportunity to participate in this important debate tonight. That is a great thing about Canada's Parliament; we want to hear from all people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319760"> I am here to talk about the situation in Syria. From the outset, Canada has actively supported multilateral efforts to address the conflict in Syria, including supporting ongoing political and security initiatives, while playing a leading role in meeting humanitarian needs. The Government of Canada will continue to closely collaborate with multilateral partners in an effort to find a solution to end the violence in Syria in order to allow for a transition to a stable, democratic and pluralistic Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319761">The violence in Syria continues to take a terrible toll on the civilian population. All Canadians are horrified by the ongoing violence in Syria, including the indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population. Despite the international outcry and numerous condemnations by the international community to end the violence, the conflict in Syria is worsening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319762">Since the violence began, more than 80,000 Syrians, most of them civilians, have lost their lives. Over 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes and communities. More than 6.8 million are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The influx of refugees fleeing Syria underscores the appalling impact of this conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319763">Canada has soundly condemned the Assad regime's vicious and indiscriminate attacks on its civilians. We continue to call upon the Government of Syria to immediately cease the use of heavy weapons in population centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319764">Conscious of the danger, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have chosen to flee their country and seek refuge outside its borders. Over 1.4 million individuals have fled to neighbouring countries. Turkey is hosting over 324,000 refugees. Lebanon is hosting over 455,000 and Jordan is hosting over 448,000. Iraq is hosting over 142,000, while Egypt is hosting more than 62,000. We want to commend the governments of these countries for their great generosity in welcoming those who are seeking safety. We recognize the burden that this places on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319765">Canada stands with the Syrian people in their time of need. Canada, through CIDA, has provided humanitarian assistance to allow humanitarian organizations to provide urgent life-saving relief inside Syria and to those who have sought relief in neighbouring countries. This support is allowing humanitarian organizations to provide emergency food assistance, shelter, safe water, sanitation facilities, essential household items, emergency health care and often much-needed assistance to Syrians who are affected by this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319766">We will continue to work closely with our like-minded partners to address those humanitarian needs, both inside Syria and in those neighbouring countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319767">For many of those remaining in Syria, unfortunately, the outlook is grim. Humanitarian organizations, most notably the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as United Nations agencies, are making every effort to meet the urgent life-saving needs of those affected by the violence.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319768">However, these efforts continue to be obstructed. UN humanitarian relief efforts continue to be hampered by extreme insecurity and restrictions imposed by the Assad regime. Sadly, even humanitarian actors are not immune from the violence and have paid with their lives in their efforts to provide relief to others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319769">Canada continues to call for a full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to those who are in need. Those in positions of power in Syria must move quickly to facilitate those efforts. The Government of Canada, in cooperation with other international partners, will continue to press at every opportunity on this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319770">Canada is deeply concerned by threats to the safety and security faced by humanitarian workers in Syria. Already the Secretary General of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and five Red Crescent volunteers have lost their lives in the line of duty. We pay tribute to their immense courage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319771">Medical personnel, medical facilities and ambulances must not be targeted, and health care personnel must be able to provide aid in safety without hindrance. The Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems, for example, must be respected by all sides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319772">Canada continues to support the efforts of the international community to bring about an end to the violence. Canada has financially supported the mission of the UN Joint Special Representative. We have repeatedly called on all parties to cooperate with and support the efforts of the Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to end the bloodshed and facilitate an inclusive Syrian-led political transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319773">We urge the UN Security Council to adopt binding international sanctions against the Assad regime in order to increase pressure on Assad to immediately stop the violence and end what is now becoming a humanitarian catastrophe. We continue to call on those countries with influence in Damascus to press the Assad regime to end the violence and work toward a peaceful political transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319774">Canada has enacted 11 rounds of strict economic sanctions against the Assad regime and has expelled all remaining Syrian diplomats. We call on countries around the world to adopt equally strong measures against the Syrian regime to ensure it fulfills its commitments and immediately stops the senseless slaughter of its own people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319775">Canada has participated in all of the Friends of Syria working groups and co-chaired a meeting of the International Working Group on Sanctions, known as the Friends of the Syrian People. We will continue to exert pressure on the Syrian regime in order to further isolate Assad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319776">The Government of Canada will continue to support multilateral efforts to end the needless suffering of Syrians affected by this crisis. We will work to ensure life-saving assistance reaches those who need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319777">Finally, the violence in Syria must end. A political solution to the crisis must be found. The international community must redouble its efforts to pressure the Syrian regime to stop the violence against its own citizens. Assad must step down to allow a democratic and pluralistic Syria to emerge. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319793">We know the situation in Syria is terrible. Let us first talk about the 70,000 people who have been killed there. I would like to take this opportunity to again extend my condolences to the families and loved ones of those 70,000 people. Beyond those who have died, however, there are also the living who are experiencing terrible suffering right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319794">For the past few months especially, we have seen a massive influx of refugees into the neighbouring countries, including Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt. In January 2013, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees counted 500,000 refugees. Half a million refugees is a huge number. Four short months later, there are 1.3 million refugees in the neighbouring countries. Some people believe that the number could be even higher because the quicker and larger the influx, the longer it takes to register people. Half of those 1.3 million refugees are children. Over half a million children are living in camps, often in appalling conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319795">All this puts absolutely enormous pressure on the neighbouring countries. Lebanon, for example, could have 1.2 million refugees by the end of the year. That is terrible. Lebanon, Turkey and the other countries are doing everything they can, but they cannot handle the situation alone. No one could. If we take the figures for Lebanon and compare them to the population, for example, it would be the same as Canada suddenly receiving 3 million refugees. A developed country like Canada would have a lot of difficulty taking in 3 million refugees at once. Therefore, we can imagine that countries in the region are facing almost insurmountable challenges, which they certainly cannot overcome without the help of the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319796">That is not all. There are refugees outside Syria, but there are also displaced persons inside the country. We are talking about 4 million displaced persons, approximately half of whom are children. In addition to those 4 million displaced persons within the country, there are 2.8 million people who urgently need humanitarian aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319797">A few weeks ago, I was in New York, where I met with representatives of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. They described the situation to me: drug shortages, destroyed water systems, lack of sanitation, destroyed hospitals, schools that have all but disappeared, children in Aleppo who have not gone to school in a year or two. The country is essentially falling apart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319798">The needs are immense. Without massive international humanitarian aid, the consequences could be catastrophic. This aid is needed immediately. Epidemics are starting to take hold here and there, and things are going to get worse this summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319799">To work with refugees outside Syria, people displaced within Syria and people who need humanitarian aid, the UN has asked for $1.6 billion, but it has received commitments for just over half that amount.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319808">I agree with those comments and with what Mr. Cornish said about how this is not a question of money. We have to admit it. We also have to convince Damascus and the opposition groups to give humanitarian workers access so that they can provide some much-needed aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319809">We also have to help and push the neighbouring countries to make it easier for humanitarian workers to gain access and do their work. There are things we need to work on. We must encourage people on the ground to comply with international humanitarian law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319810">Despite these problems, money remains the key, because in order to have humanitarian workers, there needs to be money to send them there. Of course, Canada has made an effort in that regard, but it barely scratches the surface. The <Affiliation DbId="184400" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars, even though we know from experience that hundreds of worthy projects could have been supported by CIDA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319811">Could the minister not have taken a small portion of those hundreds of millions of dollars to help cope with this tremendous humanitarian crisis?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3319828">Mr. Speaker, tonight we are all here to focus on the seriousness of the situation in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319829">Human lives are at stake here. Women and children are suffering in Syria, and Syrian-Canadian families are suffering here in Canada as they wait to see their family members. For months, the NDP has been putting pressure on the government to fulfill Canada's humanitarian responsibilities in response to the conflict in this country. That means taking action. For months, we have been urging the government to take action to save lives, welcome refugees and reunite families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319830">To date, the Syrian civil war has caused the death of more than 70,000 people. In total, no fewer than 4 million people have been displaced within or outside the country, which is 20% of the population. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said this week that there are more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees in the surrounding countries. For a country like Jordan, with 6.5 million people, taking in 450,000 refugees is a massive challenge. Organizations and authorities on site are unable to keep up with demand for infrastructure, medical care and basic necessities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319831">A month ago, an HCR spokesperson, Adrian Edwards, warned that we are at a breaking point. With the alleged use of chemical weapons, the increased number of refugees and emerging epidemics, it seems that we are about to go beyond the breaking point if we have not already. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319832">The Syrian conflict has been going on for two years now. Two years of combat, two years of internal fighting, two years of repression. The Canadian government has to face the facts: a political solution is not going to appear overnight and we must do whatever we can until then, whether that means supporting our allies, Syria's neighbouring countries, organizations on the ground or refugees fleeing the country in terror and insecurity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319833">The Canadian government cannot just keep giving speeches that are devoid of meaningful proposals. There needs to be a real plan. Otherwise, it is leaving the door open to massacres and merciless combats where no one wins and the people of Syria risk losing everything. Conversely, over the past few months, the NDP has taken action and come up with solutions to improve the lives of these refugees. We began by moving a motion in order to condemn the acts committed in Syria and get the Canadian government to do something to limit the impact of these abuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319834">Then, on a number of occasions, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> and I met with representatives from the Syrian community in Canada, something the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> has refused to do. They told us how upset they are about the current situation. They talked to us about the government's inaction both politically and in terms of humanitarian aid. They illustrated how important it is to take action in order to save lives. We need to take action right now, not six months or a year from now. Two ways we can act are by implementing procedures to expedite family reunification and by welcoming refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319835">This emergency debate is the time to think about the importance of adopting a real plan to limit the adverse effects on individuals, a people and an entire region. A more significant intervention by the international community seems unlikely at this time, given the opposition from permanent members of the Security Council that have veto power. Nonetheless, we can do something. We must do something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319836">The NDP believes that Canada must introduce meaningful measures to limit the effects of the Syrian crisis and live up to Canada's humanitarian responsibilities. We believe it is possible to take action and that we must do everything in our power to support the Syrian people, who are the primary victims of this bloody conflict. Canada must be there to support international organizations on the ground by providing equipment and supplies to improve the lives of refugees who have been in camps for months on end.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319837">That shortcoming is obvious and inevitably has consequences on the health of refugees, and the safety and capacity of the camps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319838">In March, Doctors Without Borders drew attention to the fact that Syria's health care system was breaking down, hospital infrastructure was crumbling because of bombing, and thousands of women and children were at risk. It also highlighted the dangers of disease outbreaks, the increased numbers of infections and diseases as well as a significant increase in the number of miscarriages and premature births.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319839">In addition, hundreds of thousands of people are crowding into small areas where resources are inadequate. Yes, the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> announced $48 million, but real action is still lacking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319840">The Canadian government must also focus on decreasing processing times for family sponsorship applications so that we can reunite Syrian families that are anxious about their loved ones. Their anxiety is made worse because sponsorship applications are being transferred and there are processing delays of 16 months in Ankara. That also increases the danger for Syrian applicants who have been waiting for months. In exceptional situations, exceptional measures need to be considered and taken. That is what must happen here, in the case of Syria's civil war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319841">Lastly, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> needs to introduce procedures to make it easier to welcome Syrian refugees. Millions of people have been displaced, and Canada has not stepped in to support them. The Canadian government has a moral duty to save lives and enable these people to leave the insecurity in which they live. We cannot shrink from Canada's responsibility to meet our humanitarian obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319842">To conclude, the situation is, of course, serious and the consequences are even more so. What is being done is not enough given the human tragedy taking place in Syria. There is also a complex political situation that will not make a political solution easy, as the minister suggested. Therefore, this political solution will be a long time coming. In the meantime, we must continue to act as effectively as possible and provide even more tools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319843">We need to keep on hoping to change things, keep on hoping that the situation of the refugees will be addressed and that we can improve their lives, keep on hoping that Canada will live up to its humanitarian responsibilities, keep on hoping that members of Parliament care about the fate of a population that has great need of our unwavering support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319855">I think that the government is taking steps and boasting about everything it is doing to address the situation. That being said, we need to do even more. That is key. I think that above and beyond the figures that have been mentioned and the political measures that we hope to implement, there is really is, as I mentioned earlier, an urgent need for humanitarian aid that will require much more than what is currently being done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319856">Yes, it will involve saving lives and protecting women and children from the violence they are experiencing. We must also think about family reunification. We have been calling on the government to take such measures for weeks now. We specifically asked the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> to talk to the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> about helping families to be reunited as quickly as possible.

It is for the simple reason that we all hope they will be able to go back to a normalized nation and be given the choice of where they would like to live. We presume that the majority of them would like to go back to their homes in their own country in a stable, secure Syria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319867">Second, the member mentioned the crisis in Lebanon. Many of the people Canada flew out of Lebanon were actually Canadian citizens with dual citizenship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319868">Another point I would like to respond to was, in fact, the point raised about the minister's comment that there is a need for more and that we will do more. What the minister actually said, because I was listening to that debate, was that as time goes on, we will do more as the opportunity becomes available, in concert with our international partners. Canada has done more than almost any other nation, at this juncture, in providing aid to refugees, and we will continue to do so, as the minister said. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319869">I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170529" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319870">Mr. Speaker, nearly every passing day, more shocking reports emerge of the atrocities committed against the Syrian people by the ruthless regime of Bashar al-Assad. The horrific toll of the conflict on the Syrian population is staggering. To date it is estimated by the UN that 80,000 people have been killed. More than 4.25 million have been internally displaced by the violence. In terms of refugees, we estimate that 1.4 million people, possibly as many as 1.5 million, are currently refugees from the conflict in Syria. They are in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Some are in Egypt, and some are in Iraq. According to the UN High Commission, they are registering as many as 7,000 refugees a day. We heard the minister say earlier that in Jordan, as many as 2,000 are arriving each day. This is a humanitarian crisis on a huge scale. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319871">Reports on the ground detail a litany of horrific human rights abuses committed by the Syrian regime. Tragically, with the conflict now in its third year, the human rights and humanitarian situation in the country continues to deteriorate. The UN commission of inquiry on Syria has now issued several reports documenting widespread, systemic and gross human rights violations by Syrian security forces, including arbitrary arrest, detention, sexual violence, pillaging and the destruction of cultural and other protected properties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319872">Our government, and I am sure all Canadians, continue to be deeply concerned about ongoing reports of sectarian violence, which has been exacerbated by the crisis in Syria. Upon their liberation from Assad's iron fist, the Syrian people must not find themselves threatened by those who seek to impose a new type of tyranny or those who threaten the security and stability of Syria's neighbours. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319873">Our government has for some time been speaking up for religious minorities in Syria. Most recently, on May 4, following a deeply troubling incident of violence in the coastal city of Banias, Canada's new ambassador for religious freedom, Andrew Bennett, condemned the violence and urged respect for religious minorities. The Syrian people have a strong cultural pluralism, acceptance and coexistence that is at odds with recent attacks singling out individual groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319874">There was another troubling incident recently. Metropolitan Paul Yazigi, of the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese, and Mar Gregorios Yohanna Ibrahim, of the Syriac Archdiocese, both of Aleppo, were abducted while returning to Syria from Turkey, where they had been doing humanitarian work. Once again, on April 25, our government spoke out against these events and called for the immediate release of their eminences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319875">Sadly, even women and children are not safe from the violence. There are deeply troubling reports from Syria consistently suggesting that sexual violence has become prevalent, both on an opportunistic basis and as a deliberate method of warfare. There have also been disturbing reports of displaced women being abducted. Trafficking of women, as well as girls, is well documented. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319876">The Assad regime has indiscriminately killed and injured great numbers of civilians through the use of heavy weapons in populated areas. It has launched scud missiles at the northern rebel-held cities in Syria, with no apparent effort to distinguish between civilian and legitimate military targets. There is also credible reporting that suggests the Assad regime has used cluster munitions as a weapon of war against its own citizens, including dropping bombs indiscriminately from attack helicopters on densely populated urban areas. More recently we have heard reports on the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. The UN has established a fact-finding mission to establish whether such weapons have been used and by whom. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319877">Canada has contributed some $2 million to these efforts. Unfortunately, I suppose we could say unsurprisingly, the Syrian regime and authorities have yet to grant the mission permission to visit and begin its investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319878">I think we heard the minister say earlier that if chemical weapons have been used, it would be important to determine who they were used by. If they were used, it would be important to determine when they were used and, as we said, by whom, because that would be essential in holding the perpetrators to account. There are conflicting reports, as to whether it is the regime or the rebels who have used chemical weapons. In either case, the use of chemical weapons is a huge escalation, and all of our international partners are duly alarmed by this escalation and determined to hold the perpetrators to account. Ultimately, Assad and his supporters, if they are culpable, will be held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319879">Canada's objectives in Syria support a transition to a stable, democratic, pluralistic post-Assad time, while addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of those affected by the crisis. Through this difficult and violent period, one that has claimed the lives of far too many innocent civilians, we remain committed to a democratic transition in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319880"> Canada will continue to express the need for respect and promotion of human rights, particularly for religious minorities. It is vitally important that all Syrians can contribute to development without fear of violence. It is our hope, in fact it is our belief, that the regime's strategy of ruthless repression will not succeed in crushing the spirit of the Syrian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319881">We are all hopeful that out of this terrible carnage and devastation will emerge a better future for the suffering people of Syria. I look forward to questions from my colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319882">Mr. Speaker, in terms of the early exchange that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170537" Type="2">Nanaimo—Alberni</Affiliation> had with the member for Saint-Lambert, I wonder if the member would not agree with me that there is a difference between refugee claims, treating refugees and dealing with the refugee issue, and accelerating Canada's dealing with the immigration claims of those people who are seeking reconciliation with their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319883">We have been arguing for a clear policy in the office in Beirut as well as in Amman that would allow those offices to deal on an accelerated basis with people who wish to be reconciled with their families in Canada and to make sure those claims are dealt with on an expedited basis because they are living in a refugee camp.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319884">I hope the member would understand the difference between what we are asking for and what he is saying in terms of the broad issue of resettling all the refugees. I think everyone agrees that we do not resettle all the refugees until we can figure out whether there is a political solution available in Syria. However, that is different from the people who have a connection with Canada and with Canadians and whose claims are not being treated right now on an expedited basis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319886">The member knows full well, and even the way he framed his question would indicate he is well aware that there are international norms and conventions on managing a refugee crisis situation. In fact, whether there are family members in Canada or not, if they were applying for Canadian citizenship and in the queue already, accelerated claims for a small number of those cases might be reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319887">There are very sound reasons that the UN High Commission and other responsible partners have come to the conclusion that in a humanitarian crisis it is not the first objective to take people out of the conflict zone and depopulate Syria to other countries. It creates a whole different dynamic that is actually not helpful to the long-term solution in the area and the betterment of refugee situations around the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319891">For the Canadians who have family members caught in that conflict, it is quite understandable that they would be very anxious for the well-being of their relatives. By living in a refugee camp, at least they are out of the conflict zone, but no matter how well they may be provided for, it is not a normal situation for families. We have heard examples of children. The minister gave an example of a seven-year-old child, who when asked said, “I don't like it here. I want to go home”. That is a very normal thing. However, in spite of that there are international norms that should be respected in the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319892"> I think the government is probably looking at what might be done to accelerate those who have family situations there, and there may cases for some assistance. However, for the majority, we would hope for a quick resolution to the crisis so we can move toward normalization. Populations can be dealt with as the crisis abates and a more normal situation emerges. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319893">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this very important issue and to respond to some of the irresponsible and misleading claims being made by the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319894">I understand the anxiety that Syrian-Canadians must be feeling right now about their loved ones. That is why we have been meeting with the Syrian-Canadian community regularly. The <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> has met and spoken with Syrian-Canadians on many occasions, and across the country, including Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver. I know the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has also met with the community on several occasions to discuss the situation in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319895">We will continue to meet with the Syrian-Canadian community, to hear their concerns and keep them informed about what our government is doing. Both ministers have also visited refugee camps, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> in Turkey, and the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> in Jordan, to get a better understanding of the situation first-hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319896">I must say that I find it somewhat hypocritical that the NDP and the Liberals are constantly claiming that the government needs to work more closely with international organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, yet they stand in this House and ask our government to completely ignore, if not deny, the direction provided by that very same organization with respect to this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319897">The UNHCR is not currently referring Syrian refugees for resettlement. Due to the enormity of the situation and the number of people flowing into refugee camps, it has asked countries to place their immediate focus on humanitarian assistance so that it can provide the food, water and medical care required. Our government is respecting the international consensus and expert advice of the UNHCR, and is working co-operatively with our partners. I am disappointed that the opposition is acting in direct contrast to the direction of the UNHCR on this very important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319898">Canada has provided over $80 million in humanitarian assistance to date. Just this past January, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> was in Turkey, where he met with representatives from the UNHCR and the Turkish Red Crescent, and visited displaced Syrians in makeshift camps. While there, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> announced $1.5 million for the Red Cross to help provide food, water, shelter, hygiene kits, blankets, heaters and clothing for up to 170,000 displaced Syrians. Canada is playing its part to help deal with the humanitarian situation, and we have provided significant funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319899"> The opposition also likes to conveniently ignore the efforts we have made to help relieve some of the pressure on these refugee camps. The fact is that there were already thousands upon thousands of refugees in many of these refugee camps before the Syrian crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319900">We are delivering on our commitment to resettle 20,000 Iraqi refugees, which will help to relieve some of the pressure in these neighbouring countries. Canada has the most fair and generous refugee system in the world. We welcome one in ten of all resettled refugees, more than any other country. I would note that while the UNHCR is not referring any refugees for resettlement at this time, our government has been actively working on options that will allow us to act if the UN does at some point in the future recommend resettlement of these refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319901">When the international community is in a position to change its focus from providing immediate and life-saving humanitarian aid to beginning the job of resettling persons, Canada will be there to help. We continue to encourage Syrian-Canadians who are in contact with their family members in Syria to advise them to reach the UNHCR site and register as refugees in order to be processed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319902">In addition to the refugee situation, we have made real progress on immigration applications. The visa office in Damascus was understandably closed due to the continuing violence. As a result, processing capacity in the region was increased to compensate, with more staff and processing capacity in both Beirut and Amman.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="20">(2220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319903"> Immigration officials have been working very hard to process family class and privately sponsored refugee applications from Syria as quickly as possible despite the difficult operational environment that is presented to them on the ground in the region. Instead of criticizing them, the opposition should be commending them for the hard work Canadian officials have been doing to process applications from Syria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319904">I am pleased to inform the House that almost all of the family class sponsorship for spouses and dependent children have been finalized. For family class cases with compelling circumstances, visa officers have been issuing temporary resident visas to allow applicants to come to Canada while their applications are being processed, and they are processing existing permanent resident applications as expeditiously as possible, while still ensuring that security and admissibility checks are performed. Our government has listened to the Syrian Canadian community and we are taking responsible actions to deal with this very important issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319913">Mr. Speaker, the simple answer to her question is that the processing capacity was increased in the region to compensate for the fact that the office in Damascus was closed, with the offices in Beirut and Amman becoming full-service offices. I can appreciate the anxiety and concern Canadians have for their friends and families in Syria. Officials are working to process family class and privately sponsored refugee applications from Syria as quickly as possible given the difficult operational environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319914">Having said that, I am happy to say that almost all spousal sponsorships that were pending have been finalized. For family class cases with compelling circumstances, visa officers are issuing temporary resident visas to allow applicants to come to Canada while their applications are being processed, and permanent resident applications are being processed as expeditiously as possible, while ensuring, of course, security and admissibility checks are performed.</ParaText>

I am going to quote him, and I want him to agree or disagree with the manager of the visa post in Amman, Jordan, as well as the manager in Beirut, because they wrote back exactly the same.

              <ParaText id="3319928">Mr. Speaker, I can attest that, personally working for Syrian members of my community, I have been so relieved to have two husbands come to their wives in Canada and to see an increase in staffing in Amman, Jordan. I am personally aware of that, but I definitely agree with the minister in his speech that we are not doing enough yet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319929">I am hearing reports from Syrians who are trying to get an appointment with the embassy in Lebanon, but the local staff, the guards around our embassy, treat them disrespectfully and do not let them get to the door. It is a conflict situation, and the other misconception is that the refugee camps are run by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. They are not; they are run by the host countries. Once people are there as refugees, they are still afraid. Some of them are so afraid that they are not prepared to go to the Red Crescent or the Red Cross to report in, so that they can be recorded. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319932">Mr. Speaker, it is actually quite heartbreaking to get up and take part in such a debate. As parliamentarians, I am sure that on all sides of the House, we would rather debate a thousand other things than the terrible situation in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319933">Just to remind us all, 70,000 have died in Syria during this conflict. More than a million have been displaced. That is such a huge number. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319934"> I am one of those fortunate people who have never lived in a war zone. I was born post-World War II. I grew up in England and came to Canada in the 1970s. I have never lived in a situation where the country I was living in actually had battles and bombings going on all around me. I can really say that the closest I have come to being in something that looked like a war zone was when I was in Bangladesh recently. When I turned on the TV, I saw that in the area we had left just hours before cars were being turned over and set on fire, and bombs were going off. I can remember feeling the anxiety, thinking this had happened where I had just walked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319935">Right now, my heart goes out to the hundreds and thousands of the Syrian diaspora who live right here in Canada, a safe country. What they do is watch what is going on in Syria on television and through social media. I think about the pain and anguish they must live through every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319936">When we watch it on TV and when we hear about the escalation of violence and the use of chemical weapons and that there are events that could lead to a spread of this conflict to surrounding nations, we quake. I do. I get really worried about world security and about our children and grandchildren. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319937">Then I ask myself how I would feel and what I would be thinking if it was my family members and my friends, the people I grew up with, who were in Syria right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319938">It is such a messy situation over there. There is the status quo of the ruling regime, led by Mr. Assad, and then there are a variety of groups fighting in opposition. It always reminds me that there are those who fight and those who suffer. I am not saying that the ones who are involved in fighting are not suffering, but I am thinking of all the men, women and children who never chose this conflict. They did not decide or have any say whether this conflict should be happening in their homeland or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319939">These are the families where the children just wanted to get up in the morning and go to school, or most of them did. They are the same families where the mothers wanted to cook meals and make sure their families were looked after. The families thought about the work they did, whether they worked for somebody else or were involved in agriculture or any of the other businesses. They are just normal families who wanted to get along with everyday normal tasks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319940">What happened? They woke up one morning and there was a conflict in their homeland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319941">It is not new to this part of the world, but its not being new does not make it more acceptable. I know it was contained in the beginning, but the way this civil war, if that is what we are calling it, has spread has been devastating. I cannot imagine too many communities in Syria being left untouched. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319942">In the same way, I want to say to all the families of Syrian descent who live right here in our country that my heart goes out to them. I can only imagine the kind of anguish they go through day in and day out, because I have never experienced it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319943">Today I phoned my office and asked for an update on a particular case involving a Syrian family. I am not going to use anyone's name. The mom and baby are in Syria, and the father is over here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319944">The baby is a newborn, and the family is waiting for the baby's medical. While they are waiting for the medical, they are going through the anguish of trying to get to the closest visa office. They tell of the dangers that they will experience on the way. They would love to have a visa, even a tourist visa, to come over in the meantime, but their biggest problem is that travel is not safe, and there is no visa or consular office in Syria itself. The family will have to cross an international boundary; travel documents are needed for that, and not everybody has travel documents. If people do not have them, then they are stuck. They will have to get hold of somebody who will give them the travel documents they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319945">Family members of this young man have been visiting my office on a regular basis. They heard the announcements that the government made about looking at ways to speed up reunification, especially for spouses who were separated. My colleague across the way said much work has been done and most of these people have been reunited, but many of the cases I deal with in my office are not unique. Right across Canada, there are many like the one I mentioned. My colleague across the way mentioned that he has not had any Syrians or relatives of people in Syria speak to him about the dire situation and the fear they live in, but I cannot imagine that he has not had anyone speak to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319946">I want to talk about the role of the diaspora. Some people of Syrian descent have become Canadian citizens, while others are en route to becoming citizens. Some of Syrian descent have been born here. This is their home. These people are not asking for much. Under the family reunification class, these family members would actually qualify to come to Canada. We applied on their behalf long before there was any kind of freeze, and all we are asking right now is for those people to be expedited so they can get out of a very dangerous situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319947">They have met with some officials who told them that it is dangerous everywhere in the area. One person was told he was in no more danger than the rest of the Syrians. That brings little comfort to the Canadian families over here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319948">Our officers overseas are doing their very best. Offices have been closed, consular services are not available and the few offices that are open in the Middle East area are being bombarded with requests. I admire these people for the work they do, but we really need to look at systems we can put in place to accelerate those who are already in the system, those who have applied. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319949">To that effect, earlier in this session the opposition moved a motion that was unanimously supported in the House. The government agreed with the motion, which called on the government to support the peace-building efforts in Syria by making new financial contributions to the work of the UN-Arab League joint special envoy, Mr. Brahimi.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="40">(2240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319950">That was number one. Second was to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to address the growing refugee crisis in Syria. At no time have we ever said that all of those refugees can be taken in by Canada. What we have asked for is emergency humanitarian assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319951">That is what the House asked for, by the way, not the NDP, even though it came from the NDP. I am very proud of the work done by the official opposition's critic of foreign affairs, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319952">Also, we want to expedite the process of family reunification for Syrians who have family members in Canada. That is the bit that is very confusing for the Syrian diaspora. They are not asking for the doors to be opened. All they are asking for is that family reunification be accelerated for those who have families who are in a state of war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319953">If I were in their situation, I would want exactly the same. I think my colleagues across the aisle would agree that if they had family members, a parent, a younger brother, a spouse, or their own children, in Syria today, and they were Canadian citizens, they would want to be reunited with them and have them brought to a safe place. That is something very tangible. That is something very doable that we can address. I would urge the government to take action on that particular component.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319954">In Canada, especially from the government side, we always hear about how important the family is, not once, but over and over again, and I agree. I come from an extended family. I have four brothers and a sister, and nephews, nieces, aunts and uncles. I love my extended family. I really believe in the strength of the family unit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319955">However, if we believe in families being together and the strength of the family for ourselves, then surely that is what we want for those who are separated from their families, not while their family members are carrying on with their everyday tasks—to be separated under those circumstances is painful enough—I want each and every one of us in this House to imagine the agony these Canadian families, or those who live in Canada of Syrian descent, are going through day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319956">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170673" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation>, we have had a series of unfortunate shootings. This was very tragic for our community. I can tell members that whenever we hear that there has a been a gunshot in Surrey, if we have children, and even if we do not, we shake. I can remember that there was a time I would get up, even though I lived in Vancouver, to make sure my son was in his bedroom, just because I had heard of another shooting.That is how parents feel. That is how we feel about the people we love. That was only a shooting that happened in downtown Vancouver somewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319957">Here we are talking about violence day in and day out that is escalating. Now we are hearing stories of chemicals. We are also hearing stories of possibly increased conflict with bordering countries. We are also hearing from the bordering countries about the extra pressure on them as well. It is because of this that we absolutely have to do something around family reunification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319958">We also have to take a look at providing more humanitarian aid. Canadians have huge hearts. I can remember the disaster caused by Hurricane Katrina and how Canadians not not only cried and poured out their hearts, but they also donated like one could not believe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="45">(2245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3319959">When we had the earthquake in Haiti, it was the same, and the government stepped in and put in some matching dollars. I would argue that we have a huge crisis happening in the refugee camps in and around Syria, and I would say that this is the time for us to consider taking similar types of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319960">I am a great believer in peace and the role Canada has played historically as a peacekeeper. I believe we have a diplomatic role to play as well. Unfortunately for us, and I am not going to point any fingers today, we no longer have a seat at the United Nations Security Council. Because of some of the actions we have taken over the last couple of years, we no longer have the same kind of standing with a lot of our international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319961"> However, our current government has a very close relationship with China, and I am hoping that the Conservatives are using all of the diplomacy they are capable of to press China to intervene and help to move toward peace in Syria. I am also hoping that we are using our connections in Russia to do that as well, and with other people over whom we still have some influence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319962">When we disrespect some of the institutions at the United Nations, and we call into question the credibility of a rapporteur who would dare to come to Canada and make a comment on our aboriginal communities and the way those people they live and about food security for them, and when we have those reactions, it puts our credibility at risk when we go to talk to people and try to find allies, because suddenly the world is looking at Canada in a slightly different way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3319963"> There is still time. I do not think we have gone so far down the road that we cannot reverse and become that peace-loving and peacekeeping nation again. There is an opportunity in this case here, for the government to pull out all the diplomatic skills it can muster, to call in all the favours it may still have with people out there, to work toward finding a peaceful resolution. It is not going to come quickly. There are no easy fixes here, but the only thing we can do and the only thing that is left to us is to try to find people who will talk, because we are no longer on the inside. When we were on the Security Council, we were actually on the inside and had knowledge of what was going on, and people looked to us. Now we're in the outhouse; we are on the outside. When we are on the outside, we have to rebuild our credibility and we have to go and try to see what we can achieve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3319999">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="190568" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320000">It has been more than two years since the start of the conflict in Syria. Canada, along with the international community, continues to be horrified by the ongoing violence. The growing number of civilian deaths and the influx of refugees fleeing Syria underscore the appalling impact of the conflict on the people of Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320001">Since early 2011, millions of people have been affected by the violence in Syria, with many fleeing the country due to the deteriorating humanitarian situation. Recent reports estimate that 80,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict, and thousands more have been wounded. It is estimated that more than 6.8 million people, close to one-third of the country's population, are currently in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria. There are currently more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Canada commends these countries for opening their doors and taking in so many displaced families under such difficult circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320002">Since the beginning of the crisis, Canada, along with the international community, has continued to call for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need. Given the enormity of needs, it is important that humanitarian assistance provided by the international community be coordinated. With Canada's support, humanitarian partners are providing lifesaving assistance and achieving tangible humanitarian results on the ground. I would like to highlight some examples. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320003">Inside Syria, our support, combined with the support of others, has enabled the United Nations World Food Programme to reach two million people with emergency food assistance in March 2013 and to scale up operations to reach 2.5 million in April. Since the beginning of this year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has distributed more than one million non-food basic relief items, such as mattresses, blankets, diapers, and kitchen sets to crisis-affected Syrians. The International Committee of the Red Cross has provided water treatment supplies, spare parts and generators. This ensured that more than 2.7 million people had access to drinking water between January and March of 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320004">Since the beginning of this year, the International Committee of the Red Cross, working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, has delivered emergency food assistance to more than 600,000 vulnerable people. They have also distributed household kits, including mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, hygiene kits and candles to over 200,000 crisis-affected people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320005">Canada's support does not end at Syria's borders. With so many Syrians pouring into neighbouring countries, we are supporting the regional approach of our humanitarian partners. Our partners on the ground tell us that thousands of Syrians are arriving in neighbouring countries every day, many in need of basic services, such as shelter, medical care, food and water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320006">Reports are showing that the strain on communities hosting refugees is compounding other challenges in neighbouring countries. Tensions in host communities are on the rise, mainly due to the gaps in support for communities. Acts of violence and aggression against refugees are being reported in hosting countries. The strain of hosting more than 448,000 refugees in Jordan, for example, is increasing tensions on scarce resources, including water, electricity, et cetera. In addition, Jordanians are facing high unemployment, high prices and poverty.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="10">(2310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3320007">Canada has reacted quickly to the situation. Our support is helping to alleviate some of the challenges taking root in these countries. For example, in both Lebanon and Jordan, wait times for registration of new refugees has been reduced. In Jordan, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees opened a new registration centre in Irbid in February and is registering approximately 700 refugees per day, in addition to the daily rate of around 1,000 refugees processed in Amman. Also in Jordan, our support to UNICEF has helped to provide access to safe drinking water to almost 175,000 people, and access to sanitation facilities for over 146,000 refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320008">In March 2013, the United Nations World Food Programme delivered emergency food assistance to more than 120,000 crisis-affected people through its voucher program. In addition to this, the entire refugee population of Zaatari camp, about 175,000 people, receives bread each day through the World Food Programme.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320009">In Lebanon, Canada's support to the United Nations World Food Programme helped to feed over 150,000 Syrians in February 2013 alone. It also helped UNICEF to vaccinate at least 207,000 Syrian and Lebanese children against measles, and provided 17,000 affected children with psychological support services, and enrolled over 17,000 affected children in education and learning programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320010">Our humanitarian partners weatherproofed 700 dwellings and rehabilitated more than 100 collective shelters. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees opened two new registration centres in February, bringing the total number of centres to four.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320011">In Turkey, Canada's support helped the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees distribute tents, blankets and kitchen sets to over 220,000 refugees. It helped UNICEF enrol over 26,000 affected children in learning programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320012">In Iraq, Canada's assistance to UNICEF helped provide 13,500 refugees with access to safe drinking water, and over 36,000 children and women with access to essential health services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320013">Canada will continue to look at ways to best support the Syrian population and to address the humanitarian needs arising from this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320014">Despite this, we all know that this humanitarian assistance is not enough, and that a political solution to end the ongoing conflict must be found. Canada continues to support the efforts of the international community to bring about an end to the violence. We have repeatedly called on all parties to end the violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320015">The violence in Syria must end. The people of Syria must be safe from violence. Civilians denied the necessities of life must be provided with humanitarian assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320016">I assure members that the Government of Canada will continue to work with our partners in an effort to end the suffering of civilians in Syria, and ensure life-saving assistance reaches all those who need it.</ParaText>

We have seen a disturbing trend in statements by the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs </Affiliation>in relation to the United Nations. It is a kind of contempt for the United Nations, the idea of multilateralism and diplomacy, the idea that we will not go along to get along. I put it to him that in a conflict like Syria it becomes so very clear that when we seek a political solution, if we did not have the United Nations we would need to invent it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320023">For all its flaws, for all its failures, if we cannot get a multilateral solution with persistent pressure through the UN, through the Security Council, on Russia, on China and on those countries that have long-term relationships with Bashar al-Assad, we would not ourselves want to prop up someone like that, but now that the so-called rebel forces appear to be riddled with al Qaeda and we have the conflict spreading with potential destabilization with Israel's rocket attack, we are in really serious trouble.

              <ParaText id="3320027">Our government, and indeed most Canadians, have been following the situation in Syria very closely for the last two years, and particularly in the last few months. All Canadians are extremely concerned about the loss of life, human rights abuses, the destruction of property and the destabilizing impact the civil war has had on the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320028">I think all members of the House share the desire for the conflict to come to an end and to see the Assad regime toppled. Our government has expressed this sentiment consistently for the last 18 to 24 months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320029">In recent weeks, an already terrible situation seems to be spiralling towards the depths of barbarism. The potential use of chemical weapons is something the world must examine closely and carefully. This need for careful examination stems from the fact that the use of these weapons will likely lead to a serious response by Canada and our international allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320030">By now we have likely all seen the disturbing images from Syria of patients in hospitals who appear to be suffering the effects of a chemical toxin. These weapons have the potential for mass destruction and death. They would certainly cause greater suffering for the people of Syria and wider panic and instability in the region, which will lead to a rise in the number of refugees in border states and will raise the risk level in an already unstable part of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320031">Syria is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Canada is a signatory to the convention and has a long track record of working with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Indeed, the United Nations and our allies in NATO have been watching the potential risk with respect to chemical weapons in Syria very closely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320032">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170592" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> has suggested in this debate tonight that there is some tension in the position of the government. In fact, the position of the government has been unequivocal. Assad must go, and the death and suffering needs to end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320033">The issue for our country and in this debate tonight is to determine what role Canada should play in the pursuit of these outcomes. In listening to the debate tonight, it is clear that the members of the House, including those from the Liberal Party, do not advocate direct military action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320034">Certainly, the Canadian Forces are one of the most highly trained and professional militaries in the world. However, a civilian protection mission would require boots on the ground. We are not prepared to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320035">Syrian air defence is considerably more developed than that in Libya. It is also more dense airspace, making any international multilateral military action extremely complicated and risky. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320036">It also seems clear that most members of the House do not advocate providing arms or military assistance to the rebels. I read a quote from the NDP critic stating that this was not Canada's approach. Finally, it appears that most members acknowledge that the civil war is not clearly demarcated by a monolithic rebel force on one side and the Assad regime on the other. The rebels may very well be a coalition of various groups within Syria opposed to the regime for different reasons. Most importantly, the rebels do not appear to share aspirations for a post-Assad Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320037">With all these points of agreement in mind, I would expect that most members of the House would agree with the government's approach to the Syrian crisis. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government have advocated a strong multilateral approach, with the United Nations and our allies, to apply strong diplomatic pressure on the regime and to investigate seriously the possible use of chemical weapons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320038">On March 21, the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched an investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. Canada strongly supports this investigation. Any and all credible allegations, including potential incidents in Homs late last year, and more recently in Adra, will be pursued. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320039">The UN has inspectors in Cyprus ready to conduct this investigation. These inspectors have been selected and trained and are ready to deploy on one day's notice. There just needs to be a cessation of hostilities or some form of security for this investigation to occur.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="20">(2320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3320040">Canada was one of the first countries to pledge direct financial support for the United Nations investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Canada has also provided some direct unilateral assistance to neighbouring countries dealing with the threat posed by chemical weapons. Detection equipment and protective gear have been provided to the Jordanian armed forces to guard against a chemical weapons or biological incident arising from Syria. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320041">Canada has also provided support to strengthen civilian capabilities to respond to chemical or other attacks affecting the people of Jordan. We have also pledged support for the establishment of a regional biological risk management training centre at the Jordanian university in co-operation with our allies, the U.K. and the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320042">At the time of this debate in our House of Commons this evening, the UN-led investigation into chemical weapons use and the threat they pose is at an impasse. This is not acceptable. Canada supports the UN Secretary-General's repeated efforts to resolve the current impasse so that all credible allegations are investigated as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320043">Like our UN and NATO allies, Canada continues to demand that Syrian authorities grant full and unfettered access to the United Nations investigation team immediately. In recent weeks there have been news reports and even statements by UN officials that suggest there is evidence of the use of chemical weapons like sarin gas by both the Assad regime and a section of rebel forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320044">While the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria quickly distanced itself from statements related to weapons use by the rebels, the commission did state that it “has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320045">The fog of war, the increased use of media as a tactical advantage and influence operations by parties in a modern conflict show the need for a UN-led investigation to provide clear answers. Canada is pursuing a clear but careful approach to Syria. We are working unilaterally with allies and with countries like Jordan in the region to address the threats caused by the conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320046">This government is also committed to our multilateral course of action with respect to Syria as well, working with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations. Canada has taken a principled and consistent stand on Syria. We will continue to work with our international partners to contain the threat caused by the situation in Syria, and we will continue to apply global pressure on the Assad regime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320047">These are very difficult times. This was a very good time for the House to revisit this issue and Canada's response. I think the careful and thoughtful deliberation by my colleagues tonight indicates that Canada cannot rush into an action engaging our military forces. We must keep this as a clear diplomatic effort on our part. We must clearly work with our allies, the United Nations, and NGOs working under the auspices of the United Nations, and our allies in NATO not only to assess the military threats on the region, but also to assess the real use of chemical weapons on the ground in Syria.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320048">I appreciate the thoughtful comments from all sides of this debate, but I do think this government has pursued a very principled and rational approach. We are also dealing with the humanitarian crisis surrounding Syria, and we have heard tonight on all sides some acknowledgement that Canada has reacted with respect to refugees, particularly with regard to family reunification. I think even members on this side of the House have acknowledged we could do that perhaps faster and better, but it is clear from comments on the other side that those efforts are under way and that there is real and meaningful efforts by the minister to expedite family reunification, while also providing the appropriate oversight in relation to potential security risks that might be associated with widespread departures during a time of war.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320054">Importantly, she referenced the Security Council.

              <ParaText id="3320058">When he speaks of presentations this evening that were thoughtful and calming, I must say his was one. It was thoughtful and it took into account what we all feel, that we must not be imagining for one moment that Canada wants to engage militarily in Syria. It is nice to reaffirm that there is consensus in this place on that. I also appreciate his recognition of the toolkit of statecraft and diplomacy of the United Nations, and our other relationships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320059">I would ask him very specifically if it would not make sense for us in this House to agree by consensus that there is more we can do in humanitarian effort, particularly in those very significant humanitarian crises that exist in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, by providing more assistance directly through humanitarian relief in the camps and by offering that assistance to those governments that are hosting all those refugees.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320061">Her questions are good ones. We are working with other states in the region to address the refugee crisis caused by the Syrian civil war in the last two years.

              <ParaText id="3320062">There is also security ramifications caused by a refugee exodus under these circumstances. Importantly, I have also heard some discussion in the chamber tonight about NGOs and actions by non-state actors on the ground in Syria, and I think we have to express some words of caution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320063">We are not even at the halfway point in 2013. I would remind this House that Syria is in a state of war, and as I said in my remarks, with very hard to identify teams within that war. There is certainly a united front against a regime, and then there is the regime. There have been five journalists killed this year in Syria, and we are only days past Press Freedom Day. Last month, two archbishops were abducted. It is a country with which we have to proceed cautiously, even with non-state actors on the ground.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3320064">Mr. Speaker, we have been around this block and this debate a couple of times in this House. Time and time again, the government states the same obvious thing and keeps saying how great it is doing. If we were to read the speeches from back then and read the speeches now, they say the same thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320065">However, what the government is failing to understand is the engagement of the Syrian diaspora in Canada. The engagement of any diaspora at the time of need, at the time of destruction, be it man-made or be it a natural disaster, is very important. This lesson was learned very quickly when we had the earthquake in Bhuj, back in 2001, and the tsunami and the disaster in Muzaffarabad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320066"> The Liberal government at the time set a protocol and the protocol was very simple: expedite family-class applications that are in the queue, husbands and wives, expedite parental applications, make an opportunity for people who want to sponsor their parents or grandparents or spouses to move them to the front of the line, match dollar for dollar what was raised by the community and work with the community so it can issue tax receipts. Those lessons were well appreciated by the community. Community members were engaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320067">The current government, even though sometimes pushed, continued in that same vein. Do members remember the situation in Iraq? This particular government allowed for expedition of grandparents and parents out of Iraq, as well as spouses. The only thing people had to write in their application that went to the processing centre was “Iraq” and it was expedited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320068">The government, after being pushed in committee by myself and the member of Parliament from Kitchener at the time, moved to bring refugees from Iraq into Iraq. And that continued. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320069">Then we come to Syria. The Syrian community has visited government members of Parliament, has met with the minister of external affairs and bluntly put to them, “There are two issues that we are looking for. One, help with immigration; two, help with the fundraising that we are doing by matching dollar for dollar.” The community has raised millions of dollars. It worked with NGOs, government-approved NGOs. The community approached the government and said, “Will you please match dollar for dollar?” Not only did the government not even listen, it ignored the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320070">Community members are trying very hard to meet with the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> so they can nail down if there is a program coming to them, as we have done for other communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320071">There is no such program coming to them. And there is no such hope that we will even go with matching dollar for dollar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320072">I heard a member saying tonight that we are expediting people from Syria. I reached out to the immigration offices at the posts in Lebanon, as well as in Amman, Jordan. When I said, “A lot of my constituents are asking if we are running any special programs for Syrian refugees”, the answer was, “At this time, there are no special programs for Syrian refugees.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320073">When I asked whether there was any expediting of parents and grandparents or whether we were taking any parental sponsorships, the answer was that no new applications to sponsor parents or grandparents have been accepted for up to 24 months, that parents and grandparents of Canadians citizens or permanent residents have the option of visiting Canada on a parental and grandparent super visa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320074">In order to issue a visitor visa to a parent or a grandparent, it must mean that they have something to go back to in order to come to Canada and say, “I am a visitor. That means that I am going to go back to my place that I am coming from.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320075">Well, definitely no parent or grandparent is going to go back to what is happening in Syria, so the chances of getting a super visa are slim to none.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320076">Then I asked the question, “Are we taking any Syrian refugees?” and the answer was, “The Government of Canada is deeply concerned about the crisis in Syria and will continue to do whatever we can do best to help the Syrian people.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320077">There is no word in here about taking in Syrian refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320078">Another question I posed to the post was, “Are we expediting independent class applications from Syria?” The answer was, “At this time, there are no special programs for Syrians to expedite their federal skilled worker applications.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="35">(2335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3320079">Clearly the government is failing the Syrian diaspora by not responding to their request to issue special visitor visas for their loved ones to come from Syria in order to get the program going again for parents and grandparents. It is a total travesty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320080">Then we come to the point where the community has asked to be allowed to match dollar for dollar. I had a press conference last week. The Syrian representative said he went next door and received $500 from his neighbour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320081">It is not only the Canadian diaspora, but the Canadian public needs to look at what is happening in Syria every day. We see it every night on our televisions. We read about it every day in the press or on the Internet. Canadians want to get engaged. They want to contribute. However, the Conservative government is not going to match dollar for dollar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320082">The parliamentary secretary to the minister responsible for CIDA said that the community only raised $30,000. I challenge the parliamentary secretary to sit down and speak with the Syrian Canadian Council, with Syrian organizations, and ask them how much money they have raised. She will hear that it is millions of dollars. Yet the government will not work with them. Not only will the government not match them dollar for dollar, but it will not work with these organizations in order to ensure they get a one-time receipt application so they can give tax receipts. This is another travesty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320083">The Conservative government does not care. Why does it not care? It cared for other communities. It worked with other communities. Why will it not work with the Syrian community? I wonder if there is an underlying situation that is causing it not to help the Syrians. The government does not care about Syrians. They do not matter. It might be because the Syrians do not vote for the Conservatives. It is not in their reform-alliance base to want to engage the Syrians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320084">Why is the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> playing peekaboo? Why does he say he is going to meet with Syrians but then he does not? Members of Parliament have said that the minister met here and there with Syrians. I challenged the member for <Affiliation DbId="170529" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation> to tell us where the minister met with Syrians. We have not yet heard from one Conservative member of Parliament who can tell us that the minister met with this group on this date and at this place. It would indeed be a pleasure to hear that from them. If the minister is watching tonight, maybe tomorrow he will come into this Chamber and he will ask for unanimous consent to table something indicating where he met with individuals. I have yet to hear from any Syrians in Canada, or from any members of parties opposite, about a date or a place that they have met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320085">The Syrian community wanted to meet with the minister. It wrote and it called the minister. It emailed the minister. It received a reply. The Syrian community responded back to Mr. Braun of the minister's office and it said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320094">It is the same thing that he said to the Coptic community in Toronto about a year ago. After the difficulties with the Copts, he said to that community that we were taking refugees from the Middle East, and the Coptic community is still waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320095">It is the same thing with the Syrian community. They are still waiting for that phone call. They are waiting for the something that says we are going to engage them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320097">The current government has a Reform base and always caters to that base, and there are two things it does not want to do. It does not want to open the doors to people who want to sponsor people from Syria. The Conservatives do not want to open the doors to children who want to sponsor their parents and bring them to Canada. They are saying they can come on a super visa; when that is over, they will kick them back. </ParaText>

The Syrian diaspora is asking, “Why not us? Why is our government not responding in the same way that it responded to others?” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320099">The people of that community even go further: they say they will help by donating money, millions of dollars, to the Red Cross, World Vision and government-approved NGOs, and they ask us to match them.

              <ParaText id="3320100">I am perplexed, really perplexed, that although all of Canada wants to engage, open its pockets and give, the Government of Canada certainly is not engaging.

              <ParaText id="3320101">My question is this: will the government members please find some soft part in their hearts to allow the Syrian community to adopt their parents and grandparents in order for them to be able to come to Canada? Will it allow the community to sponsor people that have been determined to be refugees and have been accepted by UNHCR to come to Canada? The community will step forward and look after them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320102">Last but not least, we should work with the Syrian diaspora to match dollar for dollar what it is raising, what it has raised by itself and through government-approved NGOs, so that it is not left out and to make sure that all communities are treated equally. Engagement in community is first and foremost. We must give communities the tools to build nations. There is nothing more important at this point in time than engaging the Syrian diaspora and providing sustainable development for nation building. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320103">Syria is in ruins. Syria must be rebuilt after the civil war is over. If we do not engage the Syrian Canadian diaspora, we will have failed. There is no one better, who knows the situation on the ground and the language, and has the capabilities to rebuild the country than the diaspora in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320104">Mr. Speaker, I just came across news that was posted about an hour ago on Al Jazeera's website that all Internet connections between Syria and the rest of the world appear to have been severed. It is too early to know who did this or if it is a temporary disruption, but certainly there is a lot of concern because the eyes and ears of the world, and Google is reporting this today as well, have had some glimpse into what is happening in Syria, the humanitarian crisis, the loss of life, through the actions of, essentially, citizen journalists able to use the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320105">I do not so much have a question, but as the minutes draw down on this debate, I would reinforce what we all know, that this situation is desperate and tragic, a humanitarian crisis, that it worsens by the minute, and that signs of hope for a peaceful solution are few and far between. We also had one of those earlier today in the commitments made by Mr. Putin and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320106">I certainly urge all colleagues, though I do not think I need to as we all feel the same way, not to let this crisis slip from our awareness and to find ways as a nation united to help people who are caught in this conflict, particularly the women and children. All Syrians in Syria and in the refugee camps need our help. I agree with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170666" Type="2">Scarborough—Agincourt</Affiliation> completely that the Syrian community here in Canada should be engaged to try to find ways to help the people currently suffering.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320107">Mr. Speaker, indeed, the news from Al Jazeera came an hour ago. This is not the first time this has been done in Syria. It was also done last November. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320108">The situation on the ground is terrible. I understand that today peacekeepers were either killed or abducted. The situation in Syria needs to be watched and we need to be engaged. It is a real shame that as Canadians we do not issue press releases. We are not engaging, not only the community in Canada but the international community, in making a difference, being a middle power, on the international stage. It is a real shame that we have not been able to do that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3320109">Mr. Speaker, it is almost midnight and we are here debating because there is a civil war happening in Syria and we do need multilateral engagement and a multilateral solution. However, I find it a little rich for the Conservative government to disengage with the United Nations but now, today, rely on the same body to come up with a solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320110">Canada has lost so much ground on the global scene. We have lost our seat on the Security Council. We have lost our ranking among the nations around the world. We used to be known as a peacekeeping nation that was in love with humanitarian aid, a country that was there at the beck and call of the world. We are not that country anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320111">Having said that, we know there is a crisis in Syria. We have heard members of the government say there is a crisis in Syria right now and it requires urgent address from our government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320112">I would like to speak about one aspect of this war, which is the women and children who are affected by it. As a woman, I am particularly moved by the fact that the majority of the Syrian refugees are indeed women and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320113">I would like to share a personnel story. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320114">I was born in the middle of a war, and I am probably one of the few members in the House of Commons who have lived through a war. It is not something a child should ever go through. I was smuggled in the cover of night with my mother and sisters, which was necessary in order to be safe. If one travelled in daylight, as a woman, one would be exposed to rape, which is used as a weapon of war. One would be exposed to extortion for oneself and one's daughters. I know that is not a condition under which anybody anywhere in the world should have to live. Being a child who witnessed people being bombed, and being shot at myself, I know we should not have any child in this world experience that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320115"> Although I experienced being shot at when I was four or five years old, today it is still a vivid memory. It is as if it were yesterday. Since I have had the privilege to live, literally a second chance at life, I have the opportunity today to speak on behalf of those hundreds of thousands of people who remain voiceless, who do not have that opportunity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320116">Those children and women who are being victimized by this war did not choose to be part of it. It is up to the international community to speak up for them. It is up to us, as parliamentarians who have the privilege of speaking up for them, to actually do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320117">We know this conflict has claimed more than 70,000 lives and it has forced more than one million Syrians to flee as refugees. Many are internally displaced people within the country and within the region. Many of these refugees have been recognized by the United Nations; they have UNHCR refugee cards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320118"> It is our responsibility as global citizens to stand up for them. It is up to Canada as a have nation, not a have-not nation, to be the conscience of the world. Canada is a bountiful nation that has so many resources and richness.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="55">(2355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3320119">It is up to us to be the conscience of the world. That is what Canada is known for. We are known for our history and for our legacy of being the conscience of the world. Having that history of being the humanitarian country, we are duty bound to these hundreds of thousands of people who are now being displaced, who are being affected by war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320120">We need to ensure there are not more and more children who are being inflicted with lifelong memories of war. It is our responsibility to remove those children from those situations. It is our responsibility to reunite families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320121">We know there are many people here in Canada of Syrian descent who have sponsored their spouses, siblings, nieces and nephews. We, as responsible parliamentarians, have the duty to ensure we are reuniting these families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320122">I know that my time is coming to an end, and with that I will leave the House with my last request for the government. My request to the government is that the government respect the wish of this House. When the NDP brought forward a motion, it was unanimously agreed to by this entire House. The motion called for support of the peace-building efforts in Syria; it called for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Syrians, to the families, to the Syrians who had families in Canada; and it called for us to expedite the process of family reunification for Syrians who have family members in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3320123">This was a motion that was unanimously agreed to by this entire House. My request to the government is that it respect the wishes of this House and that it provide that humanitarian relief, as well as expediting family reunification.</ParaText>
