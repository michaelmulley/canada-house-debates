              <ParaText id="3217510"> Mr. Speaker, tonight's vote will be telling. On November 27, 2006, the House formally recognized the Quebec nation. The time has come to recognize all the powers that come with nationhood, including the inalienable right to self-determination. In passing the Clarity Act, the federal government unilaterally claimed the right to interfere in the democratic process by determining what question and what majority are acceptable and on what terms Quebec can be master of its own destiny. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217511">Under René Lévesque, Quebec's National Assembly passed the Referendum Act, which paved the way for the referendums. The “yes” and “no” sides voted in those referendums, and no one questioned the act's legitimacy. None of the parties in the National Assembly, sovereignist or federalist, accept the idea that the Clarity Act takes precedence over Quebec's laws. No one accepts the idea of a trusteeship or a veto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217512">This evening, the members who recognize the Quebec nation should be voting in favour of Bill <Document DbId="5764047" Type="4">C-457</Document>.</ParaText>

This bill would enable seniors receiving the guaranteed income supplement to withdraw a taxable amount of up to $2,500 to pay for funeral arrangements in advance. This amount would not be included in the GIS calculation for the following year and would therefore not affect the income of our most financially vulnerable seniors, while lifting a burden off the shoulders of our seniors and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217520">We in the NDP promised to reduce poverty among our seniors, and we are practising what we preach. I therefore invite all members of the House, from all political parties, to support my bill so that we can work together to reduce poverty among our seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217534">The panel believes that when equality is achieved, then women will be truly empowered to protect themselves. We have been waiting for 20 years for this report to be addressed. We have an obligation as parliamentarians to every woman who has been abused or assaulted. We have an obligation to stand up and ensure they have equality.</ParaText>

Their community, like many first nations communities across this country, faces great challenges grappling with youth gang violence and homelessness. Far too many community members were travelling to nearby towns looking for help and finding trouble. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217551"> They decided that a better solution would be to offer positive support and nourishment in their own community. More than a year ago, they established a soup kitchen. Each Wednesday, volunteers including lawyers, band councillors, pensioners and stay-at-home moms offer warm soup and bannock, coupled with laughter and community spirit. More than 10,000 joyous meals have been provided to date. Starting next month they will do this five days a week, and the neighbouring Ermineskin Band is following suit. Janet Swampy, at the community centre, shared that they are more than rewarded with the smiles on the faces of those they welcome each week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217552">I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the women of Hobbema for this commendable volunteer initiative.</ParaText>

Energy, mining and forestry drove 15% of Canada's nominal GDP in 2011, while spin-offs accounted for another 5%. With so many Canadian workers depending on this sector for their livelihood, it is astonishing to hear the leader of the NDP refer to this sector as a disease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217554">While the NDP leader's dangerous Dutch disease theory has been dismissed by the economists and experts, the NDP leader continues to push this crazy idea.

              <ParaText id="3217807">Mr. Speaker, it is important that we recognize the fact that the government has a record in terms of putting time allocation on numerous bills. The Liberal Party has been fairly clear in stating its support for the principle of the bill that is in question today, and we would ultimately like to see it pass. We have not been putting up speakers to try to delay, or anything of that nature, but we do question the level of frequency by which the government uses time allocation. We have seen it on numerous bills, whether it is Bill <Document DbId="5258273" Type="3">C-27</Document>, the first nations accountability bill, Air Canada, Canada Post, CP, the Panama free trade agreement, budget bills, back to work legislation with regard to Air Canada, the Financial System Review Act, the gun registry, the copyright bill, the pooled pension plan bill, one of my favourites, and the Canadian Wheat Board.

Why does the government choose to introduce time allocation on many bills, which therefore takes away the responsibility of opposition members and all backbenchers, I would suggest, to provide due diligence in ensuring that every bill is given due process and is well debated and ultimately passed or defeated in the House of Commons? Why does the government go to this tool time after time?</ParaText>

I do not know if that goes on a brochure or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217813">My point is this. The irony of the government using a closure motion, a motion to shut down debate on a bill called the RCMP accountability act, seems to be lost on it. The fact that the RCMP is in need of reform is well understood in this country. I have debated the minister often on this, and he has stonewalled efforts for years. Now, when the government has brought a bill forward, insufficient and incomplete, according to members themselves, the minister says we have talked enough about this; it is good enough, like it or lump it, this is how it is going to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217814">We do not often get the chance to reform the RCMP. It does not happen every year. It does not happen every 10 years. One would think that getting the bill right would be important to the government, but it is not. What is important to the government is its continuing treatment of this place with disdain, and its fundamental disrespect of the voters we represent in saying that whatever the government's agenda is, so be it. It is the Conservative way or the highway. That is not good enough for Canadians. That level of arrogance, of uncertainty, in terms of dealing with our democratic institution, is something that will be lost.</ParaText>

Once we get down to a discussion to not include any reference to enhancing accountability, then where can the debate go from there? We are saying we need to enhance accountability. They are saying not to enhance accountability. After 15 days, the debate has ground to a halt. This is the only logical thing the government can do because there is no desire on the part of the opposition to enhance accountability. The opposition is against the concept of accountability. Those members have said so by wanting to remove the short title.</ParaText>

I found it interesting that the committee spent only a few meetings discussing this bill. The last time the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act was amended, which was several years ago, it took months and months of serious study. I find the seriousness to be lacking this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217844">In addition, the minister said at the outset that he was open to amendments because he felt that the bill was worth studying properly and that it might be lacking in some way. The only amendments the Conservatives accepted were their own, and they mainly had to do with correcting spelling mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217845">Does the minister not feel that we did not have enough time and that we still need more time to debate this extremely important bill? Does he not think it arrogant not to listen to what the opposition has to say on the matter?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217848">These issues have been brought forward in this legislation. They have been debated for 15 days. That is not even taking into account the broader context of the knowledge that each member brings to a particular file like this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217851">I was here when the minister had to stand up and amend his own legislation because, even though he was warned all through the process of the legislation that certain elements offended the charter and were unconstitutional, et cetera, the Conservatives would not allow a single amendment. In fact, they have not allowed a single amendment to a single bill in the entire 41st Parliament. It is as if they have some of kind of monopoly on wisdom in this regard, but in actual fact, they make a lot of mistakes. I have a list here of some of the charter challenges on legislation from the government since 2007; two of them dealing with the RCMP and the Expenditure Restraint Act. </ParaText>

Just when we are being told that debate has gone on long enough, the majority of the remarks coming from the Conservative bench are focusing on arguments or the bill.

It is no longer an exceptional measure. Members were just saying that it has been invoked 29 or 30 times; I have counted 32 instances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217869">My first question for the minister is how many times has it been invoked? It would be good to know the exact number of times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217870">Furthermore, I was listening carefully when he answered the opposition members. He said that there have been 15 days of debate and that that is enough. He then said that is a good bill, that he does not see why it should be amended, that the opposition members have debated it long enough, that the government is sick and tired of listening to them and that it is time to move on to other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217871">Is 15 days now the Conservative government's standard even if the opposition does not listen to reason at some point and wants to continue hearing from witnesses? If members of civil society want to express their opinions about a bill, is that the point when MPs are muzzled? Is that the criterion?

It is reflected in the type of amendments that are being made and the type of arguments that are being made. There is nothing new that the opposition members, in particular the NDP, have brought forward in the last 15 days. We have heard these arguments over and over. I invite members of the public to review the transcripts and see if there is anything substantively new, which all of a sudden is going to develop. The positions have been laid out very carefully.

              <ParaText id="3217913">An action has been filed in the Federal Court by one, Edgar Schmidt, until very recently, a senior official of the Department of Justice, a department which advertises its mandate as being to promote respect for rights and freedoms, the law and the constitution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217917">If these allegations are in fact true, my privilege as a member of Parliament, indeed the privileges of each member of Parliament, have been breached.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217918">Supposedly, when a bill is placed before the House as government bill, every member can be reassured by law that the bill is not in violation of either the Bill of Rights or the Charter of Rights and Freedoms by the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="105826" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> has examined the bill and finds it to be compliant with these fundamental Canadian laws. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217919">If the allegations of Edgar Schmidt are true, we members cannot rely on the performance of these statutory and constitutional duties to know that a bill is consistent with the Bill of Rights and charter in deciding our vote as the bill proceeds through the committees and the House. Based on these allegations, the Department of Justice is approving proposed legislation that has only a mere remote possibility of being consistent with the charter or the Bill of Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217920">In contrast, Schmidt argues that the statutory examination provisions require the Department of Justice to determine whether the proposed legislation is actually consistent with the charter or the Bill of Rights, not on the possibility of whether or not the legislation could be consistent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217921">This hinders us as members of Parliament in the performance of our parliamentary duties. It constitutes an interference in the performance of our duties to exercise due diligence of the bills before us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217922">I believe every member of the House would agree that if these allegations are proven to be true, they show contempt for the authority and dignity of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217923">If the allegations of Edgar Schmidt are true, the credibility of the <Affiliation DbId="105825" Type="21">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> and his officials on other matters related to our duties as members of Parliament is also put into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217924"> For example, in our committees, government officials are frequently accompanied by legal counsel from the Department of Justice. Questions are not infrequently posed to them, for example, as to whether a bill, if enacted, would abrogate or derogate from aboriginal or treaty rights recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217925">It is essential that the House and its committees are able to have full confidence in the impartial information provided by officials from the Department of Justice and that they are not limited by some secret policy, which would limit completely forthcoming answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217926">In this same respect, section 25 is a part of our charter and it protects the respective collective rights of each of the aboriginal peoples and their nations and communities in the event that the upholding of an individual right might negatively impact a collective right.

              <ParaText id="3217927">Again, if these allegations are true, there has been no such vigilance. As Mr. Schmidt points out in his statement of claim, it is not practical for the minister and deputy minister to personally perform all aspects of their duties under the statutory examination provisions; they must rely on the legal counsel employed in the department to support them in the performance of those duties. As a result, the signatures of certification are mostly carried out by the chief legislative counsel of the Department of Justice under the authorization of the deputy minister.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217934">In essence, if these allegations are true, the interpretation and practice of the Department of Justice has unlawfully transformed the examinations under the statutory examination provisions to one as to whether there is even a very slender possibility that a bill or a regulation might be consistent with the charter and the Bill of Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217935">That is not the intent of the protection that Parliament believes it has been provided. The obligation of the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is to certify that the proposed legislation is actually consistent with the charter or the Bill of Rights, not the possibility of whether the legislation could be consistent. If the allegations are true, the minister and the deputy minister have knowingly, or unknowingly, been systematically in default of their lawful duties with respect to past legislation and the legislation which is before this House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217936">Disturbingly, Mr. Schmidt alleges that he has personally brought these matters to the attention of the chief legislative counsel, the associate deputy minister, to whom the chief legislative counsel reports, and to the deputy minister, but that no action has been taken to bring the conduct of the required examinations into conformity with the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217937">If we find that what we are being told is true, that senior officials in the Department of Justice have secretly adopted such an absurdly low standard, obviously we, as members, can no longer rely on any opinions rendered by the <Affiliation DbId="105826" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation> about legislation. This would be the equivalent of knowingly asking Parliament to pass a bill which has a very high chance of not being in compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an improper purpose, namely seeking some collateral advantage or some partisan political advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217938">There is no question that if the allegations are true, it would raise questions of confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="105826" Type="96">Attorney General of Canada</Affiliation>, not only for members of Parliament but also for our constituents, the people of Canada.

              <ParaText id="3217939">We, as members of Parliament, have a responsibility and a duty, and I might point out a right, to determine whether the alleged situation is true. When we pass a law that is later found to be null and void because it infringes upon charter rights, it is not only embarrassing to the dignity of the House of Commons and parliamentarians, it is costly. The government could find itself paying its own heavy legal costs, the costs of the other side, and dealing with the many persons other than that actual plaintiff, who have been affected by the invalid legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217954">I move that this House express its deep concern that its privilege with respect to statutory and constitutional duties regarding the certification of the Minister of Justice that government legislation is consistent with the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Charter of Rights and Freedom may not have been properly exercised and that an opportunity be given to the Minister of Justice, in that capacity and as Attorney General of Canada, to examine the allegation that policies adopted and acted upon by his officials, with or without his knowledge, have resulted in his constitutional and statutory duties and his consequent responsibilities to the House having not been properly fulfilled, so that he may report to this House at the earliest opportunity regarding the allegations, and, if the allegations are true, to set out the actions he proposes to take a) to remedy the situation resulting from past applications of this or similar policies; b) the actions he proposes to take to deal with government bills currently before the House; and c) to prevent this situation from ever again occurring in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217955"> The House would not know if the bills before it today are compliant with the charter. One could not be more current and expedient than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217956">Further, the subject matter of my question of privilege arises from a very complicated, unprecedented situation, which has involved considerable research, discussion and debate as to how to deal with it. I have given it careful thought and consideration. I have attempted to exercise responsible due diligence before bringing this question of privilege before the House, trying to find the balance between being expedient and acting responsibly. I ask, Mr. Speaker, that you find that I am acting expediently and am meeting the test required for a question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217957">Beyond the question of expedient notice is the question of why now? Why not wait until later? The answer is that we cannot even estimate how long it will take for Mr. Schmidt's matter to be decided, even at the lowest court, and there is the possibility of appeal. In that interval, many important bills will have gone through Parliament without members knowing, without doubt, that they are consistent with the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217958">I am acting to maintain the respect and credibility due to and required by the House in respect of its privileges and to enforce the enjoyment of the privileges and the ability of its members to act on behalf of our constituents and of Canada.

              <ParaText id="3217961">Mr. Speaker, I also point out that if you believe any part of the proposed motion I intend to make should be changed to avoid procedural difficulties in the wording, my advance notice will give you the opportunity to suggest changes so that this issue may be dealt with in an informed and expeditious manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217962">In conclusion, instead of moving the customary motion that the matter be referred to the procedure and House affairs committee, I intend to move the following motion, should you, Mr. Speaker, find a prima facie case.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217964">My motion will also propose that a special committee of the House be struck and that the special committee be chaired by a member of the opposition, to hear such witnesses and examine such documents as are necessary to consider whether constitutional and statutory duties regarding certification of government bills have been properly fulfilled and if the privileges of this House have been breached or if this House has been disrespected, and to report to this House regarding its findings, and if the findings are that the duties have not been properly fulfilled, to set out recommendations for actions which should be taken to remedy that situation as it has occurred in the past, actions which should be taken to deal with government bills currently before the House, and actions which should be taken to prevent this situation from ever again occurring in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3217966">My motion will also propose that the legal counsel of the House provide advice to the special committee and that it hold all of its meetings in open session, except for those few occasions where examination of documents or witnesses might be privileged or confidential. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3217968">Mr. Speaker, I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="105825" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> will want to add something to this, but I would like to respond initially to some of the claims made by the hon. member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217969">First, a matter like this, of course has to be raised at the earliest opportunity, and this is old news. The member claims he is raising it at the earliest opportunity. In fact, he is relying on allegations made by one Edgar Schmidt in a court docket that was filed December 14, 2012. We are talking about matters that are already a quarter of a year old. He has not raised them at the earliest possible opportunity. They could have been raised when the House resumed in January. They could have been raised throughout February. He is only now raising them, well into March, so he does not pass that test at all. In fact, there are literally dozens of entries in the court docket that have occurred in the intervening period of time. There were dozens of additional instances. He has not raised any of this in the House. What is before you, Mr. Speaker, certainly is out of order on that basis alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217970">Additionally, I would note that the member is asking you to deal with a matter of law. It is well established under the proceedings of the House that you have no jurisdiction over questions of law and matters of law; those are for the courts. You have jurisdiction over matters that relate to the procedures and rules of the House of Commons, Standing Orders and practices, not questions of law. On that alone, it is also not appropriate to deal with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217971">The third point he touched on is that of the <I>sub judice</I> convention. This is before the courts right now. The questions are being resolved in the courts under our practices and rules. We cannot relitigate them in a parallel fashion in the House when they are before the courts. The <I>sub judice</I> convention prevails, and that is what should be done with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217972">I have to say that I take very strong personal exception to the intent of this question of privilege that has been brought. The <Affiliation DbId="105825" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> is an experienced barrister and solicitor of very high standing. He is subject to oaths, as a solicitor, to exercise his professional obligation, and he is subject to similar oaths as the Attorney General and Minister of Justice of this country. The suggestion is that he has not been exercising his professional obligation in that regard. This is a scurrilous, scandalous and defamatory allegation on the part of the hon. member, and it is inappropriate when we have an individual as esteemed and professional as the Attorney General whose obligation it is to exercise his own professional judgment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217973">The essence of his argument is that because, according to the hon. member, he is not agreeing with somebody else's professional judgment, somehow his judgment is to have no value. Actually, it is quite the opposite. As the <Affiliation DbId="105825" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation>, and a barrister and solicitor, it is his obligation and duty to apply his own professional judgment as to the law. To suggest otherwise, in my view, would be an abandonment of his oaths and obligations. I am very saddened and disappointed that we have heard this point of order raised by the opposition today. It is below him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217974">I expect the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> will want to say more on this matter. I put it that there are several bases on which it can be easily dismissed. It simply does not raise a question of privilege, and I expect we will hear more from the Minister of Justice.</ParaText>

What we have been forced to see is bill after bill, and those of us who have practised at all in the law who are watching recent court proceedings have a grand sense of misgiving that the legislation that has come before us has not been adequately scrutinized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217980"> I am not going to put myself in a position that the hon. government House leader wants us to of making any personal aspersions toward any individual. However, I actually attempted to raise this as a point of order. I certainly appreciate that the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre made it a question of personal privilege. I also feel that my personal privileges have been violated by having legislation brought to this place that clearly has not taken into account the charter implications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217981">I raised this on March 7, 2012 on the subject of the omnibus crime bill, so-called Bill <Document DbId="5120829" Type="3">C-10</Document>, because we just had seen the Ontario Superior Court rule on the matter of R. v. Smikle, and it was quite clear that the legislation before us might be, in fact, non-compliant with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is an offence to all of our roles, individually, severally and as a body, to have legislation brought before us forced through by majority vote, which is a disservice to the people of Canada and a disservice to our traditions of law and respect for the rule of law by having legislation here that has not been thoroughly reviewed to ensure its constitutionality.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3217983">Mr. Speaker, I want to address the comments from my hon. friend across the way on two specific points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217984"> One point is on the immediacy with which my friend from Winnipeg brought this motion forward. As was explained in his motion, if the government House leader had been listening, the complexity of this particular case gave reason. He had brought that reason forward, both in his motion and I believe in dealings with the table, to express that this was as quickly as we could bring the research together around this particular point of privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217985">The second point is that it was with some irony that in his argument against this point of privilege, the hon. government House leader then brought another time allocation motion into this House. I would suggest it was somewhat out of order, in that we were dealing with a motion of privilege. It is somewhat ironic that after talking about the openness, transparency and decency of their government, the Conservatives then shut down debate in Parliament again on another piece of legislation, having just minutes ago voted time allocation on another separate bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217986">Lastly, in the debate on the last time allocation motion 45 minutes or an hour ago, the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> made it quite clear—and I seek, Mr. Speaker, that you check the blues on this point—that he had no concern for lawyers and judges when he was designing policy, and that the concerns of courts and those who seek guidance from the legal profession as to whether they are valid or not or whether they can stand a charter challenge or not are not a concern to him as the Minister of Public Safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217987">Also of grave concern—and we can submit them to my hon. friend across the way—are all of the pieces of legislation that the government has introduced that have been struck down by the courts because the Conservatives had not vetted the legislation. This is at great cost to the Canadian taxpayer, never mind to those people who are affected by legislation that locks them up, essentially illegally, while the courts move through the government bills that are not to be applied and judges then have to wrestle with badly written pieces of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217988">Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the prima facie case of privilege that we are seeking from you is to say that members of Parliament on all sides are addressing pieces of legislation that have not been properly vetted for their ability to stand a charter challenge; that the debate that takes place in this House is encumbered by the fact that the government is choosing to ignore and not solicit the advice of all those legal minds in the Department of Justice, which we pay for, to give that very advice to allow Canadians to see legislation that actually does what it is required to do rather than play politics with the legislation, as has too often been the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217989">If the Conservatives were not playing politics, one would assume that they would seek to make their legislation charter-proof. They do not. This is a problem that faces the House because we are constantly encumbered by legislation that is dealing with something that cannot survive a charter challenge. Therefore, the debate enters into some realm of fiction and partisanship that does not allow for actual improvement of the law and the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217990">I would offer to my friend across the way, the House leader for the government, that we did bring this motion of privilege forward expeditiously. I think the member from Winnipeg made his case soundly and succinctly with good research and backing as to why this is a problem. While this is a challenge for you as Speaker to determine whether it is prima facie, I very much look forward to the contribution that the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> will make in this case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217991"> I would suggest to the House leader for the government that he has upped the ante in this by somehow suggesting that the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is now breaking his oaths and that this was an attack on him personally. We look at this as a direct contribution to the further erosion of Parliament's ability to do its job on behalf of Canadians. If government members seek to somehow make this a personal case against the Minister of Justice and the oaths that he has taken as a barrister and solicitor, that is their choice. It was not mentioned by my friend from Winnipeg. It was not mentioned by the official opposition. Therefore, that is a choice for him to make. However, I would ask him not to bring that into the debate, but it is not in my power to discern what he thinks is valid or not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217992">Mr. Speaker, on a prima facie case of privilege, this is something that I think bears your consideration. Obviously, it looks like we will hear from the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and we can move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3217993">For heaven's sake, one would think that a bare minimum requirement of being the Government of Canada would be to introduce laws that would actually stand a test by the charter and bill of rights of this country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3218035">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand to speak about a very important part of our trade agreements in our country right now. Many Canadians are concerned about the foreign investment protection agreements and trade agreements the government signs and is currently negotiating. One of the main areas of concern in these agreements relates to what are known as investor-state dispute mechanisms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218036">Canada has 21 FIPAs in force with countries as far afield as Russia and Argentina, Thailand and Romania. Many more are awaiting ratification or are currently being negotiated. The FIPA model has been enshrined in the North American Free Trade Agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218037">The NDP believes in setting up a rules-based system that protects investment while preserving public policy flexibility, democratic decision-making and the rule of law. However, an ISDS, as it is typically written, does not conform to principles of the rule of law. People point out that these mechanisms provide no security of tenure for arbitrators. There is a lack of an effective appeal procedure. They are rife with conflicts of interest, and they are not necessary when the state parties have mature judiciaries where investors can bring their complaints and have those complaints adjusted according to the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218038">The China-Canada FIPA that is currently before the Canadian Conservative cabinet even allows for arbitration to happen in secret. That is unprecedented in Canadian treaties, and it is a major step backward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218039"> Many people question investor states in general. Criticism comes from across the political spectrum. Australia has decided not to pursue investor-state provisions in trade and investment agreements, and so have India, South Korea and South Africa. Even those who are generally supportive of free trade agreements are worrying about the implications of investor-state provisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218040">Lawrence Herman, counsel at Cassels, Brock &amp; Blackwell and a senior fellow of the C.D. Howe Institute, someone with long experience in international trade and international business transactions, said this: </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218049">Civil society is weighing in. Recent transatlantic statements signed by dozens of European, Canadian and Quebec organizations strongly oppose the inclusion of an excessive investment protection chapter and IS dispute settlement process. They point out that such provisions weaken democracy, that in terms of the CETA agreement currently being negotiated, Europe and Canada both have legal systems that are more than capable of handling disputes between investors and governments, and that ISDS forces taxpayers to pay for the public health, environmental and other regulations of their governments to foreign corporations if they are sued. They say that there is an inherent bias in the system, and it is prone to corporate bias. There is also scant evidence that these mechanisms encourage inward or outward investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218050">What I want to ask the government is why it is pursuing an investor-state provision in these agreements, when they subject Canadian taxpayers to potentially billions of dollars in lawsuits. Can it not construct a protection for investment that preserves a democratically elected government's ability to make policies for the economic, environmental and social development of the Canadian public? Why can we not do that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3218051">Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in the FIPA or any of the free trade agreements that prevents Canadians, the federal government, provincial governments and municipalities from making economic, social or environmental policy to suit themselves. I have responded to the member many times on this subject. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218052">It is hard to combat rumours, innuendoes, half-truths and misleading statements. As a great example, the hon. member himself said something about folks who are generally supportive of free trade. What is that? What does that mean? That is some kind of great half-legalese speak craziness. No one really knows. Who are those people? We have heard time and time again from the NDP about claims against Canada by the United States or Mexico. How many claims have there been against Canada? We have not heard that number. Another number we have not heard is how many have been successful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218053">We are a trading nation that needs clear, solid, unequivocal rules to trade by. Part of that is negotiating free trade agreements around the world. Part of that will be the final stages of the CETA, the comprehensive economic trade agreement with the European Union that the hon. member discussed. He discussed some of the challenges in a negotiation that has not yet been completed. However, what he does not say is that there is a 20% increase expected in Canadian trade that is expected to bring $12 billion to the Canadian economy. In order to do that, we need clear parameters on investment. We need surety for Canadian investors abroad and for foreign investors in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218054">Let us take a look at the fearmongering and the record of the NDP. Let us talk about protection against discrimination in the marketplace and how to do that. We do that with foreign investment promotion and protection agreements. We do that with investor state provisions. That is how we do it. There is no guesswork. There is no tying it up in the courts for years and years at a time. There is an arbitration process, and the issue is settled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218055">The former NDP critic from Windsor West said he supports the efforts of big union bosses to stop any future trade negotiations with Korea, Japan and the European Union because apparently it affects some people who are NDP supporters. The former NDP trade critic from Dartmouth—Cole Harbour described the free trade agreements as “job-destroying”. Another former trade critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation>, said that free trade has “cost Canadians dearly”. That should be explained. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218056">Let us have a reasonable, rational debate about this, and hopefully soon, but let us not speak in innuendo, rumours and half-truths.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3218065">Surely the member does not think the Mobil Oil case in Newfoundland is a proper example. The Newfoundland government had 4% of the shares in Mobil Oil, which prevented it from having a seat on the board. The Newfoundland government wanted 5%, which would have given it a seat on the board. I can understand the government of Newfoundland wanting that. However, one cannot change a written agreement in the country without both parties agreeing to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218066"> Therefore, arbitrary action on behalf of one party, whether for the good of that party or not, which is yet to be decided, has to be agreed to by both sides. In the case of Newfoundland, it was not agreed to. It went to court and Newfoundland got its seat, but it also lost its case.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3218076">Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows and has commented, on this side of the House, the government voted against Bill <Document DbId="5353445" Type="4">C-400</Document>, on February 27 of this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218077">It is important to note that investments have been made to address housing and homelessness in our country, in every community across this land. In 2008, our government committed an additional $1.9 billion, over five years, for housing and homelessness programs. As a result of that commitment, the homelessness partnering strategy was renewed for an additional five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218078">We have worked closely with the provinces and territories to deliver funding earmarked for housing, most recently through the investment in affordable housing framework agreement, which provides for a combined federal, provincial and territorial investment of $1.4 billion over three years. It is focused on reducing the number of Canadians in housing need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218079">This funding is over and above the $1.7 billion we provide annually in the form of ongoing subsidies to support over 605,000 households who are living in existing social housing. These subsidies help to ensure that lower income families and individuals living in these homes do not pay a disproportionate amount of their salary or income towards housing, getting at the very root of what the member speaks about in terms of the issue of making a decision as to whether it is home or it is feeding their children or families. We have made a determination that it should be housing and the ability to ensure healthy meals are there on a daily basis for those individuals and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218080">In addition, let us not forget the $2 billion-plus in social housing investments that were included in the stimulus phase of Canada's economic action plan. As reported earlier, this funding supported an estimated 16,500 social housing projects across our country. I am sure that in Windsor, as in my community of St. Catharines, those investments were spent immediately and they assisted in delivering on repairs to the units in existence in cities like my home riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218081">I know the minister came down a couple of times to make announcements. I know I had the ability to let the region know we are making investments in partnership with the region and with the provinces on social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218082">That was not a commitment the NDP was prepared to support at that time. That was not a commitment that it saw as a need in this country. The NDP made a determination that it was going to vote against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218083">During a time when we were in recession, we included an investment in social housing as part of a stimulus program because we believe in the future and making sure we are able to deliver on behalf of these individuals and these families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3218093">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to take this opportunity to revisit the issue of devastating cuts to the health care of refugee claimants that I have raised during question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218094">The government cuts to the interim federal health care program have resulted in confusion over who is covered and who is not. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3218095">What we do know is that some of Canada's most vulnerable people are going to suffer from serious health problems because of this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218096">Now the government is creating different classes of refugees.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3218097">If the government had conducted consultations, it would have known that these cuts will actually lead to increased long-term costs as we provide emergency services to people for health issues that likely could have been prevented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218098">For over 56 years, Canada has provided health care to refugee claimants under the interim federal health program. The program covered the cost of basic health services for refugee claimants until they were eligible for provincial health care or were not accepted as refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218099">Despite the crucial role this program played, especially in covering the cost of basic medication, the Conservatives have once against shown that they are only too happy to abandon the most vulnerable people in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218100">That is what happened on April 5, 2012, when without even consulting stakeholder groups, the Conservatives announced drastic cuts to the benefits available to refugee claimants. While they claim that they are still providing care to refugee claimants, the new program does not even include things like life-sustaining medication, which could lead to worse scenarios.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218101">These cuts have created situations like one that I have had to work with in my constituency office. In this case a claimant was actually refused coverage for his dialysis treatment, which pushed him off the transplant list. Thankfully, his coverage was reinstated through the good work of my office, but he is on the line for the cost of treatment for the period he was cut off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218102">Is this how the Conservatives treat some of the most vulnerable populations in Canada? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218103">However, that is not all. If the minister designates a claimant's country of origin as safe, then refugee claimants from that country receive no coverage at all, unless their health poses a risk to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218104">This is yet another example of arbitrary powers being placed in the hands of ministers, something that has become more and more common with the current government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218105">In fact, the cuts to refugee health care are so misguided that the government is facing several challenges by stakeholders and related groups. Only last week, a legal challenge was launched on behalf of the Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. They argued these cuts violate fundamental human rights that are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218106">In addition to that, eight health care organizations have joined forces to urge the government to reconsider the cuts to the program. A letter from these organizations to the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> states: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218107">

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">To ensure the health and well-being of our society's most vulnerable population, and in line with our country's principles of compassion and inclusiveness, we urge your further reconsideration to ensure that the Interim Federal Health Benefit continues to provide extended health coverage for all refugees. Just as hardships and health issues do not distinguish between sub-categories of refugees, neither should the program.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218108"> What is clear is that these cuts put doctors and health care professionals in a horrible position: their gut and their Hippocratic oath tell them to do the right thing, while government policies that are designed to try to attract votes order them to do something different, to the detriment of the patient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218109">Cutting health care funding for refugee claimants creates inequalities among an already vulnerable population.

              <ParaText id="3218112">To that end, the member made an important point that supports the government's position. She indicated there was an individual in her riding who had been told that treatment would not be available to him. Due to the work of her office and herself, I am sure, that individual actually ended up receiving treatment. What I am basically stating is that the program does work. A mistake was made with the individual in the member's riding and that care was returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218113">What is important to understand is that the interim federal health program, which was put into place in 1957, more than 50 years ago, was meant to be a supplement to assist those who came to the country and did not have provincial health care when they arrived here. The interim federal health plan was able to help these permanent residents in the early seventies when we began to take refugees into our country. This was an opportunity to say we had a program that was available to them, so from a health care perspective at least on an interim basis, we could assist these individuals in the practical health care they needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218114">We watched that program grow to the point where it was not just providing the basic health care benefits that most Canadians received who did not have or had not purchased additional coverage in terms of things like eyeglasses, dental work, prescribed medication. These were offerings and health care benefits that many of the Canadian public did not receive, but those who applied for refugee status did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218115">The changes we made in June 2012 were that those who were refugees would continue to receive those benefits. Those who were granted refugee status by the UN would receive supplemental benefits to assist them in their transition into permanent residency in Canada. However, we were not going to allow, and Canadians across the country have agreed with us, bogus refugee claimants who came to the country simply to take advantage of our system with the same types of benefits that those who truly deserved them should have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218116">To that end, the last three months have proven this to be true. In November, December and January we have seen a 70% reduction in bogus refugee claimants who were making claims in our country simply to stay here to take advantage of the Canadian system and our good-heartedness and our spirit of trying to assist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218117">We put this in place. We have seen a 70% reduction. That means two things. It means those who do not deserve the benefits are not getting them. Those refugees who truly deserve asylum in our country, those who are fleeing from persecution, are now in a much better position because there is an additional $2 billion in health care benefits over the next five years that will be available to those who have earned permanent residency. Canadian citizens will be able to undertake and receive some of those $2 billion in savings that we have achieved.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3218118">Mr. Speaker, when people access these benefits, it is because they need them. Imagine my constituent who was told that he could not have his dialysis anymore. Now he has a bill to pay to cover the period between his denied coverage to the point when his claim was finally reinstated. That is a shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218119">The government continues to drive wedges and promote distrust. Nobody is arguing that there are no refugee claimants who do not have appropriate circumstances to support their claim. However, drastic changes like these are unguided at best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3218120">What does the government have to say to the gentleman I represent who is out-of-pocket for dialysis for the period he lost his coverage? How did his situation change in any way beyond the outcome of an arbitrary decision and the funding gap that was unnecessary? He is still on the hook for expensive treatments, while his own case is being straightened out. This shows a true lack of concern for real refugee claimants and paints Canada in a negative way. Worse, there are many more cases like his across the country. </ParaText>
