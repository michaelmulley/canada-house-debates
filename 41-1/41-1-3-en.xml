              <ParaText id="2431381">The Ottawa Valley is well-known for its sporting traditions and contributions to the history of hockey. By defeating the two-time defending champion, Vernon Vipers, in thrilling fashion, they rewarded their loyal fans and added a new chapter to the hockey lore of the Ottawa Valley.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431382">I commend the Lumber Kings' players and coaches for their outstanding performances. I also recognize the Vernon Vipers for their valiant title defence.

              <ParaText id="2431384">There are desperate needs in my riding. In May, at times, it got to the point where the Gatineau hospital's emergency room was filled to over 200% of capacity, and the Gatineau CSSS had to ask people to avoid emergency room visits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431385">In 2010 and 2011, the average wait time to see a doctor was approximately 24 hours. In 14% of cases, wait times exceeded 48 hours. We all want a more effective health care system that meets everyone's needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431386">From the very first day of the election campaign, the NDP, my leader and I put health care at the top of our priority list. The government said in the Speech from the Throne that it will help to ensure the stability of the health care system and will work to reduce wait times while respecting provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431389">This past weekend I participated in the Streetsville Bread and Honey Festival, which is a very popular local event in my riding. Founded in 1973, it has become an annual event celebrating the historic backbone of Streetsville's economy, which was its five major mill sites along on the Credit River. Honey was included to reflect the many small apiaries existing at the time the festival began.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431390">The festival was run by over 300 volunteers over the three days. Thanks go to local business, community groups and service clubs that donated thousands of hours of their time for this event. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431393">On D-Day, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division stormed Juno Beach facing fierce opposition and Canadian soldiers secured a critical bridgehead for the allied invasion. The liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany soon followed.</ParaText>

Poised between the blue water of Lake Ontario and the highlands of Durham, with its roots in first nations and around the world, in the tests of war and the promise of peace, from Carruthers Creek to the Rouge Valley, our community brings economic dynamism, youthful creativity and enriching diversity to Canada's table.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431675">I rise today to table before this House budget 2011, a low tax plan for jobs and growth, a plan to ensure Canada will remain on the right track for economic growth and jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431676">As I said in this House less than three months ago, implementing the next phase of Canada’s economic action plan will preserve Canada’s advantage in the global economy, strengthen the financial security of Canadian workers, seniors and families, and provide the stability necessary to secure our recovery in an uncertain world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431677"> It is my hope that the members of this House will now move quickly to implement this job-creating plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431678"> We are on the right track with nearly 540,000 jobs created since July 2009, the height of the global economic recession, and seven quarters of positive GDP growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431679"> Our job creation is the envy of other advanced countries, with job growth concentrated in full-time positions in relatively high wage industries. While that is positive news, too many Canadians are still looking for work and the global economic recovery remains fragile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431680"> By supporting this plan, hon. members will echo the most essential endorsement of all: the backing of Canadians themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431681"> Through their votes last month, their voices have been heard and they said yea to the economic plan that was put before them. Canadians gave this government their support for job creation and efforts that will help businesses and entrepreneurs succeed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431683">Canadians endorsed an economic strategy that would help Canada’s seniors secure a dignified and hard-earned retirement, through an enhancement to the guaranteed income supplement, and new tax support for Canadians making selfless sacrifices to care for a loved one.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431690">To support job creation, for example, this budget includes our intention to introduce a one-time hiring credit for small business. It will provide an EI break for some 525,000 small businesses, reduce payroll costs, encourage hiring and give companies and the employees who work for them the boost they need to fully contribute to the nation’s economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431691">This budget also includes a two-year extension of the temporary 50%, straight-line accelerated capital cost allowance for manufacturing or processing machinery and equipment, incenting our businesses to invest, improve productivity and stay competitive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431692">In the still-uncertain global climate, many businesses remain hesitant to hire and expand. In the Year of the Entrepreneur, we are creating the environment for the private sector to invest again and take its rightful place as the engine of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2431693">Creating the environment necessary for our businesses to thrive also requires assisting hard-working Canadians as they make the most of the opportunities ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431694">As was the case in March, the next phase of Canada’s economic action plan will support Canadian families across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431695">This support includes: providing additional support for a work-sharing program that has helped more than 277,000 workers; renewing two special EI measures to assist Canadians in their search for a job, support worth $420 million over 12 months; extending the targeted initiative for older workers program until 2013-14, ensuring older workers have access to training and employment programs that will prepare them for new careers; supporting the helmets to hardhats program to assist the brave veterans who offer up their lives to protect our country by helping them find work in the construction industry when they leave our armed services; supporting the courage of volunteer firefighters who risk their lives to protect ours by establishing a new volunteer firefighters tax credit; and easing the financial burden of young Canadians preparing to assume their rightful place in tomorrow’s economy by enhancing and expanding eligibility for Canada student loans and grants for both full and part-time post-secondary students.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431696">Part of helping hard-working Canadians, of course, is keeping their taxes low as they try to make ends meet. This commitment explains why the average family of four now receives almost $3,100 in extra tax savings thanks to the numerous tax reduction measures introduced by this government. It also explains why the federal tax burden for all Canadians is now the lowest it has been in 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431697"> We are building on that low tax commitment even further through the measures being tabled today. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431699">To provide greater support to those seniors most in need, we will provide a top-up benefit to the guaranteed income supplement. This is an affordable new measure that will provide up to $600 extra per year for single seniors and up to $840 per year for senior couples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431700">It will lead to greater financial security for more than 680,000 seniors across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431701">This of course is on top of actions this government has taken that are already providing $2.3 billion in additional tax relief to seniors and pensioners right now in this fiscal year, measures like pension income splitting, increases in the age credit amount and a doubling of the maximum amount of income eligible for the pension income credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431702">For those Canadians coping with the added responsibility of caring for infirm parents or other relatives, we are introducing a family caregiver tax credit in the amount of $2,000 that will benefit more than 500,000 Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431710">The cornerstone of the updated budget tabled today, just like the one tabled on March 22, is strong fiscal management. That budget included the strategic and operating review designed to realize substantial savings through greater efficiency and effectiveness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431711">With the backing we have received from Canadians on May 2 to guide us, we will now launch that review so that once it is completed we will achieve $4 billion in annual savings and allow the government to return to a balanced budget by 2014-15, one year earlier than previously planned. These substantial savings will be reported on and recorded in budget 2012 when the review is completed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431741">I have to ask the minister, why is he cutting the very programs without telling us definitively where they have been cut? Why is he cutting the very programs that the regions need in order to develop economic prosperity and move ahead in the future?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431742">Mr. Speaker, the third party in this place now is an expert in cutting. This was the party that in the mid-1990s cut transfers to the provinces. What were those transfers for? They were for health care, education and social services. Liberals did it without notice. They did it without negotiation. It resulted in the closing of schools. It resulted in the closing of hospitals, in the laying off of nurses. These are the experts who well deserve to be sitting where they are in this chamber today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2431744">Much better, Mr. Speaker. Our debt to GDP ratio is about 2.4%. Compare that with the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries which are up 10% and more. This is not a matter with which any of us certainly on this side of the House can be complacent. There are difficulties in the world economy. We are pleased that our country is recovering better than some other places. We also wish them well, of course, because this is an integrated economy, a global economy, and Canada is not an island. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2431745">We will maintain our course, in response to the hon. member, to ensure that on the deficit and debt we get back to a balanced budget, and then get back to the position where we can pay down public debt. We paid down almost $40 billion of public debt before the great recession happened, and it happened from outside Canada and came into this country, but it put Canada in a position where we could take the kind of action we did in the economic action plan.</ParaText>
