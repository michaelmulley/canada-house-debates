              <ParaText id="3248650">Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the House deeply disappointed by yet another Conservative budget that disregards the real priorities of Canadians and instead pushes ahead stubbornly with an austerity agenda that will have real consequences for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248651">In budget 2012, the Conservatives chose corporate giveaways and attacked the programs and services that Canadians rely on. While the Conservatives have promised to focus on jobs, budget 2013 instead focuses on job-killing austerity cuts. The Conservatives have not listened to Canadians. They are plowing ahead with cuts to pensions, health care and EI, while ignoring the serious threats facing our economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248655">This budget has been plagued by Conservative mismanagement. Just six years ago the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> handed over skills training responsibility to the provinces. Now he is shutting those programs down and returning that money to the federal government. Following the 2008 economic crisis, the Minister of Finance begrudgingly ramped up infrastructure investment. Now he is cutting billions from infrastructure investments. Overall, these cuts will cost tens of thousands of jobs in cities and communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248656">The Conservatives claim to be strong fiscal managers, but the facts point to the contrary. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> missed his economic growth target for 2012 by 35%. He has presided over a $67 billion trade deficit. Private sector economists are now telling us that this year will be even worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248657">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has changed his budget projections so often it is difficult to take them seriously. As this budget is being tabled, Ottawa is running about $2 billion behind where the Minister of Finance wanted to be. Yet the minister's timetable for deficit reduction has little to do with external realities. Instead, a growing number of prominent bank economists, including Craig Alexander and Don Drummond, agree that the government has fixated on eliminating the deficit ahead of the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248658">Following a recent meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, BMO's chief economist Doug Porter told reporters it would probably be unwise for the federal government to step on the brake even further than it already has. There is also growing consensus, from the IMF to participants at the World Economic Forum in Davos, that austerity is not the right way to go. In fact, it is making the problem worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248659">At the World Economic Forum in Davos, former U.S. treasury secretary Dr. Lawrence Summers agreed that austerity is not an effective solution for today's circumstances. Of his speech at Davos, economic reporter Chrystia Freeland wrote:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248666">In fact, an IMF report released in January estimated that in the European case, every dollar in government spending cuts would cost $1.50 in lost output. The bottom line? We cannot cut our way to prosperity. It just does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248667">The Conservatives like to crow about their abilities as fiscal managers, but it is increasingly clear that they are more interested in ideological dogma than they are in getting our economy back on track. Let us be clear. The Conservative government caused our current deficit, not overspending. In 2008, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> proclaimed to Canadians there would be no recession here. The Conservatives refused to take action until their government was nearly defeated in the House of Commons. More and more economists agree that our ability to react to the 2008 financial crisis was severely undercut by the government's reckless insistence on deep corporate tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248668">Appealing to their Conservative base helped get the government into this mess, but it will not help get us out. The fact is that in a stalling economy we cannot cut our way to growth. Instead, the best way to balance the budget is to invest in job creation and kickstart economic growth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248669">The NDP supports investment in skills training and believes that education and training are important factors in creating high-quality, high-paying jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248670">However, right now, for every job available, there are six Canadians looking for work. This week, Statistics Canada confirmed that this number has remained relatively steady since last year, and the Conservatives' plan will not properly address the problem. The Conservatives are simply juggling money and trying to take credit for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248671">The biggest economic challenge we are facing today is a weak Conservative economy. Canada fared better than many other countries throughout the last recession, but Canadians and their economy are falling behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248672">Unemployment remains high—more than 7% nationally. Some provinces have unemployment rates in the double digits, and more than 1.3 million Canadians are still without work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248673">In addition, a number of segments of the population, such as youth, aboriginals and new Canadians, are still facing unemployment rates that are far higher than the average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248674">Household debt continues to reach unprecedented levels. It currently sits at 167% of disposable income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248675">At a time when families are barely making ends meets, hundreds of thousands of Canadians hold part-time and precarious jobs, when they would prefer permanent, full-time positions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248676">We just received a United Way Toronto and McMaster University study. This report reveals that 50% of the workers in Hamilton and Toronto are working in precarious jobs. That is no way to sustain an economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248677">In the last week, we were disappointed to hear that Canada fell out of the top 10 of the human development index, a ranking we had dominated throughout most of the 1990s. In fact, Canada fell six spots over the last year alone. Conservatives are content to say that other countries have just improved faster than we have. The reality is that Canada's growth on the index has been substantially lower than many of its peers, especially those near the top of the list. Unlike most of the top 10, our growing income inequality has dragged down Canada's ranking on the UN list. In fact, the Conference Board of Canada has given Canada a “C” grade, and ranked us 12 out of 17 peer countries on the issue of income inequality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248678">It is clear that the government's choices are holding back our social improvements. Yet Conservatives would have us believe, “There's nothing left to see here. Move along”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248679">They have spent untold tax dollars on advertisements for their budgets, even buying expensive ad time during the Super Bowl and the Oscars. However, budget 2013 shows us once again that this is just a shell game. There is no Oscar for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248680">On infrastructure, training and support for manufacturing, the Conservatives are mostly just shifting around money and trying to make it look like they are taking real action. They claim to be dedicated to closing tax loopholes, but their cuts to the Canada Revenue Agency are a serious hindrance to achieving that goal. This budget policy brought to Canadians is more like a Don Draper budget, all spin and no substance. We are not <I>Mad Men</I> here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248681">Canadians want to do better and they deserve a government that is committed to doing better too. We need a government that is willing to aim higher, not one that is content to simply say that all is well. We know the Conservatives get their policy ideas from just a select few, even though the finance committee undertakes pre-budget consultations every year. I will tell members what we heard from Canadians about their priorities for 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248682">The Assembly of First Nations told us that: </ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—investments in First Nation education systems become even more crucial to ensuring that First Nation citizens can take advantage of existing and projected opportunities. Canada requires a well-trained workforce, especially in the booming resource extraction industry, and First Nation entrants into the labour market will be crucial in filling current and future labour market requirements in all sectors, skilled trades and professions.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248684">However, budget 2013 not only fails to address the specific challenges faced by aboriginal people, it actually introduces a regressive new workfare program for first nation communities. Conservatives are touting their goal of having an education act in place by 2014 and claim to be committed to consultation with first nations, but the Assembly of First Nations has opted out of this process already due to the Conservatives' stubborn piecemeal approach. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248685">Instead of building a new, more respectful relationship with first nations, the measures in budget 2013 reveal an insulting, in fact, even a paternalistic approach. Despite supporting the NDP motion on Shannen's Dream for equitable funding for first nation students, the Conservatives are failing to provide any additional funding to close the 30% funding gap for students in first nation communities. Shannen's Dream remains just that, a dream. We need action from the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248686">The Federation of Canadian Municipalities emphasized the link between productivity and infrastructure investment. It told us:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248687">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—during the period when productivity in the United States outpaced Canada’s, infrastructure investment in Canada declined by 3.5 percent while in the United States it grew by 24 percent. The discrepancy between Canada’s infrastructure investments and that of other global competitors, especially China and the European Union, are even greater.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248688">In fact, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimates Canada's infrastructure deficit at $123 billion. That was in 2007 and it is even greater today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248689">The Canadian Construction Association agreed. Its representative told the committee that “there can be no economic growth without state-of-the-art and well-maintained critical public infrastructure”. The Association of Consulting Engineering Companies also confirmed that “A national, long-term infrastructure investment strategy can eliminate the economic costs of infrastructure underinvestment and promote a sustained economic recovery in Canada”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3248690">Yet, in budget 2013, and I know they have announced a lot of big numbers, there will be a decline in infrastructure spending. Of the numbers they have announced, most will kick in in 2020 or even beyond.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248691">The Conservatives can play with the numbers all they want, but the fact remains that the federal government's investment in infrastructure over the next few years will still be less than $5 billion. Money will only be available to cash-strapped provinces if they can afford to match the federal government's contribution. The New Democrats obviously want taxpayers to have value for their money.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248692">We are open to finding creative ways to do this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248693">We are open to the idea of finding creative ways to get the private sector to participate. The private sector can sometimes offer the best value but, in other cases, it may be more costly to use private sector intermediaries. We should not force communities to choose one option over another.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248694">We have seen the underwhelming take-up of the P3 fund. I think only about 30% of it has been taken up. Municipalities do not want to be forced into costly P3 solutions. That is not the way to treat municipalities. Meanwhile, the necessary plan for long-term, predictable, sustainable infrastructure funding, long requested by municipalities across the country, is still missing from the equation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248695">The Canadian Labour Congress told us:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248697">Once again, with budget 2013, the Conservatives have failed to introduce new measures to create jobs. In fact, there are still 300,000 more unemployed people than before the recession. While the budget extends the existing small business job creation tax credit, which we support, it fails to provide any new tax incentives to encourage youth job creation. We are just not doing the job we need to be doing on behalf of our young people. It is not only a personal tragedy for young people that they cannot get a start in the workplace, it is also a drag on our economy. If young people do not get a good start early in their lives, not just in any job but in a decent job, that negativity, lack of income and underperformance tends to extend for a number of years. That is a loss to our economy and to our society, and it is a tragedy in the individual lives of young people across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248698">Rather than offering a real program for skills training and job creating for aboriginal youth, the budget forces first nations communities to impose a workfare program on youth living on reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248699">Campaign 2000 told the committee:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This period of slow economic growth and high personal debt requires the federal government to prevent and reduce poverty for the health and well-being of all Canadians.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248701">Nothing is being done in budget 2013 to address the record levels of household debt. Instead, the Conservative government has remained focused on an austerity agenda that has made major cuts to the services families rely on. Budget 2013 pushes ahead with $36 billion in reckless cuts to provincial health care transfers. That is still looming on the horizon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248702"> Even in the wake of multiple food safety scares this year, the budget does nothing to reverse the $56.1 million in dangerous cuts to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, putting the security of our food supply at risk. Budget 2013 also continues with changes to EI that will force workers to take a 30% pay cut, despite overwhelming opposition from Canadians. That is simply unacceptable. We do not need a low-wage strategy; we need a good jobs strategy here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3248703">Meanwhile, the budget reverses the Conservative's 2007 decision to hand over responsibility for skills training to the provinces, but it provides no new money for education and training. That is great public administration: download the programs to the provinces, and then without consultation, upload the programs to the federal government. It is clear to us that the Conservatives have not been listening to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248704">However, New Democrats have been listening every step of the way. That is why we are focused on the real things Canadians want, on changes for Canadians—real people in Canada—on the solutions they are looking for and on the real priorities in the lives of Canadians. That is what we are going to deliver when we get the chance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248705">We need solutions like investing in small businesses to create jobs for young people. We have a tremendous opportunity with the creativity, education, enthusiasm and ingenuity of our young people that, frankly, we are squandering. However, New Democrats are going to do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248706">Youth unemployment, which is at a whopping 13.5%, is two and a half times the national rate. There are still 240,000 more young people unemployed than there were before the recession, but all the budget does for youth job creation is re-announce funding for 5,000 internships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248707">
                <I>TD Economics</I> has said that the spike in youth unemployment from the recent recession will cost our economy $10.7 billion in the next three years alone. This tragedy for individuals is also a tragedy for our overall economy and our overall society. Clearly, putting people to work is the best way to reduce our deficit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248708">There is no need to reinvent or privatize public services. There is no need to trample on economic or labour rights.

In fact, Canadian municipalities are now responsible for 53% of infrastructure in the country, but they receive just 8¢ of every tax dollar collected. Meanwhile, Canada remains the only G8 country without a national transit strategy. How does that make any sense in a modern economy?</ParaText>

Too many Canadian veterans are struggling even to access the health care they need. Those who served after the Korean War are finding themselves unable to access long-term care services offered by Veterans Affairs.

              <ParaText id="3248743">Mr. Speaker, the member is right in saying that there has been a call for more skills training. What I have focused on is that with this budget the government would just be moving existing money around. In order to get any of this money spent in the future, the government members would have to sit down with the provinces and bargain agreements to use the money already out there that provinces are already using for skills training. The provinces are not being consulted on this. In some ways, it may do the opposite of what the member is calling for because there would have to be a lengthy negotiation with the provinces on skills training. It would have been more productive if the government had done these negotiations in advance and was actually putting in some additional money, bringing new money to the table to achieve skills training.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248747">There would be no new money for skills training. The Conservatives would actually freeze funding at 2007 levels, which is actually a 10% cut if we adjust for inflation. How can that be, when youth unemployment is up 5% since 2007 and when over one-third of Canadians between the ages of 25 and 30 are still living at home with their parents?

I do not know how only funding the advertising industry is going to get this economy back on track, but young people today are tragically being left behind. Not only are they facing the highest tuition fees ever and the highest levels of student debt, but when they get their education and are out in the workforce, if they get any kind of employment, it is very precarious. It is not enough to sustain them and they are having trouble even paying off their student debts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248751"> These training programs are pretty thin gruel. It would be existing money that supposedly the federal government would upload from the provinces, after downloading it a few years ago. How would this all work? The Conservatives would have to sit down with the provinces and consult with them and negotiate agreements.

Labour funds invest that money in businesses that are struggling, in businesses that are just starting up and in businesses that will create jobs.

              <ParaText id="3248762">Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to speak to budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248763">I have to say that, based on the Conservatives' fanfare as they released part of the budget in the days leading up to yesterday, I was expecting great things from budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248764">After all, we were led to believe that this budget would help address Canada's skills gap: 260,000 jobs without people; 1.3 million people without jobs. We were told that the skills gap was the most pressing issue of our time and that new investments would form the cornerstone of this budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248765"> Reports said that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was mad as hell about Canada's training programs and that he would not take it anymore. However, when we finally had a chance to see the budget, it did not even come close to this hype. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248766">Not only is there no new money for training, the government is actually freezing its training budget at 2007 levels. What has happened since 2007? The economy went into a recession, from which the Canadian labour market has yet to recover, and inflation over the last six years has driven prices up by 10%, so a dollar today simply does not go as far as it did in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248767">What we have now is an even greater need for training programs to get Canadians back to work, but the government is actually providing fewer resources than before. In the lead up to the budget, the Conservatives identified the correct problem, but in the budget they failed to provide an adequate solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248768">If the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was mad as hell before the budget, he must be absolutely furious today, because the measures in budget 2013 will not improve training in Canada. With less money for training than before, a 10% cut, when we factor in inflation, simply will not get the job done. It simply will not be enough to satisfy someone who is actually concerned about Canada's skills gap.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248769">I imagine that if the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had been serious about this, he would have accepted the premiers' invitation to sit down with them in Halifax. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248770">Perhaps what is really irking the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is the fact that he has not been able to take credit for Canada's training programs. Maybe that is why he did not sit down with the premiers in Halifax to talk about the economy. Imagine, the premiers asked the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to sit down with them last autumn to discuss the economy at their premiers' meeting in Halifax, and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said no, that he did not have to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248771">Budget 2013 actually helps the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s real objective, and that is to stamp the economic action plan logo on every training program in Canada. However, the Conservatives should not be preoccupied simply with ensuring that the federal government gets all of the credit. They should be focusing on helping Canadians get jobs. On that point, budget 2013 fails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248772">The budget attaches new strings to the training funds that require matching provincial money. Cash-strapped provinces simply may not be able to afford it. British Columbia has said that it was alarmed at the change. Alberta is not sure even if it can afford to participate in the program.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248773">The Quebec Minister of Finance, Nicolas Marceau, said, “—this is a direct attack on Quebec. It is economic sabotage.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248774">Clearly, these proposed changes in budget 2013 require a greater level of co-operation between the federal government and the provinces, but the Conservatives have got off to a very bad start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248775">When it comes to training, what the Conservatives have delivered is not an economic action plan. It is an economic inaction plan. In terms of Infrastructure, this is another area where budget 2013 does not live up to the hype.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248776">There is a national consensus that we must do more to invest in our communities. Some say that there is $160 billion infrastructure deficit. We have known for years that the government's infrastructure plan from budget 2007 would expire in 2014, and we were led to believe that budget 2013 would deliver significant new money to help Canadian cities and communities invest in infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248777">Not only does budget 2013 fail to deliver the goods, the Conservatives are actually cutting new infrastructure funding in order to balance the budget by 2015. Starting in 2014, the Conservatives will cut new funding for provincial and municipal infrastructure by almost $2 billion a year, compared to what was actually already in budget 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248778">New money under the building Canada fund drops from $1.7 billion in 2013 to a paltry $210 million for each year until the budget is supposedly balanced. On top of that, the Conservatives are playing a shell game with infrastructure. They are taking infrastructure money from budget 2007 that they have failed to yet get out the door and are spreading it over the next five years and trying to call it new money. It is another example of the Conservatives economic inaction plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248779">We were told that the budget would focus on manufacturing. This is an area where the Conservatives have a dismal record. In fact, Canada's manufacturing sector has hemorrhaged jobs, an astounding 350,000 net jobs lost since the Conservatives took office in 2006. Clearly, the status quo is not working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248780">What does budget 2013 do? The cornerstone of the budget's plan for this sector is another two year extension of the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance. This is the third time the government has extended this program for exactly two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248781">The private sector has been asking for a five year extension so it can plan ahead for long-term capital investments and make strategic investments based on the long term, not on the availability of government funds. Instead the Conservatives are only prepared to offer more of the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248782"> Whether it is training, infrastructure or manufacturing, budget 2013 just does not live up to the Conservative hype.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248783">In terms of the deficit, this is a budget that back loads its investments at the end of this decade and then projects a surplus in 2015 that is no bigger than a rounding error. The Conservatives are basing their budget surplus on rosy revenue projections and cuts to new funding for infrastructure. This is more false advertising. Again, the Conservatives economic inaction plan is full of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248784">The Conservatives' plan promises jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. What does it actually deliver? On the jobs front, the percentage of Canadians with paid work is still lower than it was in 2008. Canada's labour market still has not recovered from the recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248785">It is even harder for young Canadians to find work. The employment rate today for young people is more than five points worse than prior to the recession. More Canadians in their late twenties are stuck living at home than before. In the late 1990s, one in five Canadians in their late twenties was still living at home with parents. Today, it is one in three. Young Canadians simply cannot afford to move out. Their incomes have dropped since 2008. They are being squeezed between being underemployed or unemployed and having to pay crippling levels of student debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248786">Lost in yesterday's budget coverage was the release of a TD Bank report on student loans. According to this report, student debt in Canada now stands at almost a trillion dollars. It is the second highest source of debt in Canada next to home mortgages. The 90-plus day delinquency rate on student loans is at an all time high. The Government of Canada has been writing off hundreds of millions in Canada student loans over the last few years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248787">Too many young Canadians are losing hope. We run the risk of creating a lost generation of youth who are burdened with high debt and have no useful work experience.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3248788">Young Canadians, their parents and their grandparents are looking to the government for a concrete strategy to create new opportunities for young Canadians. Instead of delivering a real plan to help our youth, budget 2013 focuses its so-called job opportunities for youth plan on more government advertising. Under this so-called youth jobs plan, the Conservatives are taking $19 million from existing programs and reallocating that money to advertising, as though the solution to the country's job crisis for young Canadians is more economic action plan ads on TV.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248789">Budget 2013 also places Canadian jobs at risk by continuing to hike job-killing EI premiums. In fact, the average Canadian worker will pay an extra $50 in EI premiums next year and his or her employer will face even higher increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248790">With measures like these, no wonder budget 2013 assumes that Canada's unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 will in fact go even higher than previously predicted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248791">The Conservatives also talk about growth and long-term prosperity. Well, the budget assumes that Canada's economy will actually slow down. In fact, the government had to reduce its growth projections for this year by more than a full percentage point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248792"> It seems the only growth taking place in the Canadian economy right now is the growth in household debt. This does not bode well for the long-term prosperity of middle-class Canadians. Canadian families now owe a record $1.67 for every $1.00 of annual income. This level of personal debt is higher than American families were carrying prior to the crash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248793">Meanwhile, median household incomes have flatlined over the last four years. Canadian families may have bigger mortgages today, but they are in no better position to pay them. In fact, a growing number of Canadians are now struggling to pay their mortgages, even at low rates. They are petrified as to what will happen when rates go up. Making matters worse, housing prices are starting to soften. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248794">For many Canadians, their home is not simply a place where they live, it is also part of their retirement plan. The experts say that Canadian home prices are now over-valued, and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is partly to blame. It was the finance minister, with his risky mortgage scheme in budget 2006, that brought U.S.-style 40-year mortgages with no down payments to Canada. That scheme made 40-year mortgages the norm in Canada, it drove up housing prices and it helped to create a housing bubble. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248797">Quebeckers wanted the government to change its mind about employment insurance reforms and the Canada pension plan and cancel cuts to economic development for the regions of Quebec, science, and programs and services offered by departments like Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Sadly, the government chose to stubbornly stay the course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248798">Moreover, the government is once again interfering in areas under Quebec's jurisdiction, including labour. The federal government is tackling the deficit at Quebec's expense and resurrecting the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>

Many communities in Canada, including too many first nations, lack adequate water services. The protection of fresh water and the economies that depend on it are under attack by the Conservative government, which removed protection from 99% of Canada's lakes and rivers, closed the ELA, gutted fisheries protection from the Fisheries Act and scrapped thousands of environmental assessments from massive pipeline projects.

We want to deliver results, and we have. The average age of a piece of infrastructure in Canada has dropped to 14 years from 17 years.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3249154">Mr. Speaker, it was in budget 2006 that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> actually brought in 40-year no-down-payment mortgages to Canada, and that had a significant effect. By the first half of 2008, over 50% of new mortgages issued in Canada were 40 year mortgages. His decision to introduce U.S. style loose money mortgages to Canada actually changed the culture of borrowing and lending in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249155">Now we have record debt levels and a softening housing market, and Canadians are looking to the government for leadership. Budget 2013 will not help middle-class families who are struggling. Instead, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s recent demand that banks increase mortgage prices will only make it harder for middle-class families to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249156">I will give an example. Increasing the mortgage rate from 2.89% to 3.09%, which is exactly what the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> asked Manulife to do, would actually cost someone with a $400,000 mortgage an extra $12,000 over the next five years. That is an extra $12,000 that a Canadian family would have to set aside and it would add an extra $12,000 to the profits of banks or financial institutions, simply because the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> decided to meddle in mortgage prices, trying to undo the damage he did with his loose mortgage policies in his first budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249157">Unlike the Conservatives, a Liberal government would never have jeopardized the economy and Canada's housing market with a risky mortgage scheme. Unlike the Conservatives, the Liberal Party and Liberal governments have a strong record of economic and fiscal competence. It was a Liberal government that turned a $43 billion deficit that it inherited from the previous government into nine consecutive budget surpluses and paid down more than $80 billion off the national debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249158">Today, a Liberal government would prioritize measures that would kickstart the economy and help create jobs. Thanks to the hard work of the 1990s, the Government of Canada's finances are strong enough to allow some flexibility. We could support economic growth now and still balance the budget in the medium term. We could afford to freeze EI premiums in order to protect Canadian jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249159">We could afford to remove the 2% funding gap on post-secondary education for aboriginal Canadians. In fact, we cannot afford not to. Aboriginal Canadians represent not only the youngest and fastest growing population in Canada, they are also the most economically and socially disadvantaged. In fact, only a third of young aboriginals are graduating from high school, and that is why it is horrendous that the government has not devoted one penny in this budget to K-to-12 education for aboriginal youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249160">A Liberal government would also end the Conservatives' wasteful and ineffective advertising campaign. The government's spending has exceeded half a billion dollars of Canadians' money on Conservative ads. We see economic action plan ads every night on TV, even during the most expensive airtime, such as NHL playoffs, Super Bowl and the Oscars. A Liberal government would introduce new rules to ensure that government advertising is non-partisan and provides real value for taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249161">There are some measures in budget 2013 that we have been calling for, and as such are willing to support. Last year, I tried to amend the budget bill to increase the maximum threshold for the hiring credit for small businesses from $10,000 to $15,000. We warned the government that continuing to freeze the threshold at $10,000 was punishing small businesses near that threshold and creating a perverse situation that encouraged them not to go over it and hire more people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249162">The Conservatives were too stubborn to support our amendment last year, but I am glad to see that it is in their proposal exactly as we proposed it a year ago. Freezing EI rates for all businesses would have been even better, but fixing the hiring credit for small business is better than nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249163">We have also been asking the government to listen to the manufacturing sector and extend the accelerated capital cost allowance for at least five years. The Conservatives have partially listened and extended the program for two years, which is better than nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249164">Last November, on the eve of Black Friday, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170638" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation> stood in this House and asked the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to reduce tariffs on hockey equipment. He asked the government to get rid of this $200 million job-killing hockey tax, and we are pleased that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has listened to the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="170638" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249165">Despite these individual measures we cannot support the overall direction, or perhaps lack of direction, in budget 2013. Instead of delivering measures to kickstart the economy, the Conservatives are making short-term spending cuts their priority.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249166">Instead of introducing a real plan to create jobs, budget 2013 would increase job-killing EI taxes, freeze money for training at 2007 levels and cut new funding for infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249167">Instead of cutting Conservative waste, the budget would devote even more money to advertising the government's economic action plan, with this year's television ad campaign beginning mere hours after the finance minister delivered his budget speech.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249185">The fact is that youth employment numbers are five points worse than they were five years ago in 2007. That is why it is unacceptable that in this budget the government has frozen federal funding at 2007 levels. In real terms, that represents a 10% cut because of inflation. Beyond that, we have a significantly worsened employment situation today than we did in 2007, after a financial crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249186">This is the question the hon. member should be answering to what could be a lost generation of youth in Canada. Why is the government doing less today to invest in skills and training than it was doing in 2007, prior to a global financial crisis? Why is partisan government advertising of over $600 million more important to the government than investing to protect and create opportunities for young Canadians?</ParaText>

They represent a remarkable opportunity and the government does not get it.

              <ParaText id="3249213">It is an honour to participate in the debate on economic action plan 2013. While the budget was tabled only yesterday, this is a process that started for myself and my colleagues on the finance committee last summer when we started preparing for our committee's annual pre-budget consultations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249214">Today's document is truly a reflection of months and months of consultations by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the finance committee and all members of Parliament who went from coast to coast to coast to ask Canadians for their ideas and thoughts on how to make the Canadian economy stronger. I would like to thank all Canadians who made their voices heard and participated in that process and assure them that economic action plan 2013 keeps Canada on the right track for jobs and economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249215">Indeed, with over 950,000 net new jobs created since the depth of the global recession in July 2009, with 90% full time and nearly 80% of those jobs private sector jobs, Canada has the absolute best job growth record among all G7 countries in recent years. What is more, Canada is alone among G7 countries to receive the highest possible credit ratings from all of the major credit rating agencies with a stable outlook, which contributes to low borrowing costs. It is little wonder Canada has earned the trust of global investors for its responsible fiscal, economic and financial sector management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249216">In the words of the independent IMF recently, “Our outlook for the Canadian economy is a relatively rosy one”. However, as Will Rogers once said, “Even if you are on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there”. Indeed, in a fast-changing global economy that not only remains uncertain in places such as the U.S. and Europe, but where Canada faces growing competition from new emerging economies such as China and India, we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to keep on moving forward with positive measures for Canada's economy and job growth.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3249217">Economic action plan 2013 strengthens this record with actions in all areas that drive economic progress and prosperity by connecting Canadians with available jobs, helping manufacturers and businesses succeed in the global economy, creating a new building Canada plan, investing in world-class research and innovation, and supporting families and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249218">During my time, I would like to delve into more detail about these key initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249219">The first is connecting Canadians with available jobs. The government knows that Canadian workers are among the highest educated and best trained in the world. However, the training system must be better attuned to helping Canadians acquire the skills they need to obtain high-quality jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249220">Economic action plan 2013 announces the government's intention to renew the labour market agreements with the provinces and territories in 2014 with investments of $500 million per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249221">The agreements will be reformed to directly connect skills training with employers and jobs for Canadians with the Canada job grant, which is the centrepiece of the new agreements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249222">The grant will account for $300 million of total annual labour market agreement funding from the federal government on full implementation in 2017-18. The grant will require matching contributions from employers as well as provinces and territories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249223">Businesses with a plan to train Canadians for an existing job or a better job will be eligible to apply. The grant will provide access to a maximum $5,000 federal contribution per person toward training at eligible training institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249224">This means that the grant could provide Canadians with $15,000 or more per person, including provincial, territorial and employer contributions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249225">I am extremely proud of the Canada job grant as it responds to the most common and frequently mentioned concern during the pre-budget consultations that I participated in as both a proud member of the finance committee and as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249226">Indeed, as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce outlined in its recent Top 10 Barriers to Competitiveness for 2013 report, the number one issue identified by businesses across the country as holding back economic growth and hurting our ability to compete globally was Canada's skills shortage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249227">In the words of chamber president Perrin Beatty, “We have a skills problem well on its way to becoming a crisis, and you need only look at the demographic wedge that we're confronting to see that the problem is only going to get worse.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249228">As well, we could listen to the president of the Mining Association of Canada, Pierre Gratton, speaking about his sector alone: “Labour market studies show that mining will need to hire 10,000 workers every year for the next 10 years. ...and we all need to work together—industry, governments, educational institutions, first nations and other partners—to ensure Canada's economy does not falter because we fail to fill the jobs our economy has to offer.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249229">I think the Canada job grant, which will directly connect employers looking for skilled workers who want to fill those jobs, is an extremely positive initiative in helping match and train more Canadians, but that is not all we are doing to support training in economic action plan 2013. We are also supporting persons with disabilities, youth, aboriginal people and newcomers to get into the labour force with new training investments. Indeed, I would like to highlight just a few of the measures we are taking to create and provide more opportunities for aboriginal youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249230">This government is providing $241 million to help aboriginal youth across Canada to access the skills and training they need to participate in large economic projects like those in the resource sector near their communities. Indeed, in my home province of Manitoba, we see tremendous success stories of businesses getting aboriginal youth involved and allowing them to benefit from economic opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249231">I use as an example what I saw first-hand with Vale Inco in Thompson, which established its own training program for aboriginal youth on reserve. We are seeing more aboriginals than ever before getting involved, being employed by resource industries such as Vale Inco and taking advantage of these good high-quality jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249232">The budget will complement and enhance our ability to work with business, other levels of government and first nations communities to provide economic opportunities for the unemployed. I think that is something we would all like to see happen more and more, and economic action plan 2013 will do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249233">I would like to also discuss the new investments for infrastructure in the budget, specifically the creation of a new building Canada plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249237">I would implore the opposition to take the time to really, truly consider the effects and the positive initiatives for Canadian people and to support the budget once and for all, because it really does help our communities to thrive.

              <ParaText id="3249239">For example, with regard to the QFL Solidarity Fund, does the minister not realize that $10 billion has been injected into Quebec's economy over the past 30 years and that 500,000 jobs were created and saved since 1990? The governments are getting their money back within three years. With 2,239 partner companies, one in seven Quebec workers was able to participate and 200,000 Quebeckers were able to contribute to an RRSP for the first time by investing in the fund.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3249264">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise today to speak to our economic action plan 2013. I would like to start by congratulating the minister on the fine job he has done. To me, it is like he has hit another home run. He has been up to bat nine times and each time, it does not matter what the economic situation is, he is able to adjust, respond and create and craft a plan that is suitable for the challenges we face. I am very proud to be on the team and I am proud of our economic action plan 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249265">I have to take a quick minute to contrast our plan with what would be the policies of the opposition. Ronald Reagan once said it best in terms of how the opposition would approach it. He said, “If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it”. For our part, we know there are certain measures that we need to take to ensure a strong and vibrant economy, jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity. These measures certainly would not be the policies of the opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249266">Today, it is important for me to focus on some of the areas in our tax system. There are two really important areas on which I will focus on. One is red tape reduction. The other is the integrity of our tax system through looking at areas such as the closure of some tax loopholes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249267">Another quote I always like is from Albert Einstein. He said, “The hardest thing in the world is to understand the income tax”. That was a long time ago. As our world becomes more complex, our income tax also becomes more complex and adds complexity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249268"> There is something that is important and that is a covenant. It is a covenant that the government has with the Canadian taxpayer. Taxpayers work very hard for their money. They expect to pay the minimal amount of taxes necessary for us to do the things that are important for them. Whether that be equipping our armed forces or providing the necessary roads and infrastructure, they want us to ensure we really focus on the very important use of their money because they have worked very hard for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249269">With regard to that, it is important to remember that since we came to office, our government has been focused on recognizing that and has cut taxes for Canadians over 150 times. That leaves important dollars in their pockets to do the things they want to do for their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249270">Right now, it is particularly important that we are focusing in on the tax system, as many Canadians are gathering their papers together and submitting their taxes to the Canada Revenue Agency. Many people have very simple taxes. They sit down, they have their income, they might enjoy the transit tax or the arts tax credit and they might have a few expenses, but for them, it is moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249271"> It is important to note that in order to maintain the integrity of our tax system, we need to focus in on loopholes, aggressive tax planning and the use of offshore tax havens and tax evasion. All of those things mean that ordinary everyday Canadians will have to pay more money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249272">We are certainly committed to maintaining the integrity of our tax system and also to protecting our tax base. It is important to note that in a 2012 study, PricewaterhouseCoopers ranked Canada higher than any other G7 country based on the overall case of complying with our tax obligation. That is a really big plus for us, Canada and our system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249273">Our government has realized that it needs to provide the CRA with important necessary tools to crack down on tax cheats. That is why we focused in on the CRA's international audit program by nearly 40% from the last year of the Liberal government. What Canadians need to hear is this. They will hear the opposition say that we have cut the audit program and so on, but we have not. We have really focused time, energy and resources on that program and it is bearing results. We have recouped significant dollars from the program.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249274">When Canadians hide their income and assets in foreign jurisdictions, they take valuable tax dollars away from our health care, pensions and social programs. In other words, again, we all suffer from tax evasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249275">In budget 2013 we proposes a number of measures that will further strengthen the CRA's ability to address the aggressive international tax planning and to combat international tax evasion. These tools will give CRA an unprecedented ability to maintain and protect the tax base. It is also important to recognize that the finance committee is currently looking at the issue of tax evasion and the use of offshore tax havens. These measures are very consistent with the testimony we have heard from witnesses in terms of important measures the government needs to take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249276">We moved forward on some of the important measures we heard, because it was important not to wait. I also hope through our study the finance committee is doing, we will actually have some additional recommendations we can provide for government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249277">Let us take a quick look at some of the tools included in economic action plan 2013. Currently, banks, credit unions, caisse populaire, trust and loan companies are required to report international electronic fund transfers of more than $10,000. Many people will know this by the name FINTRAC. Budget 2013 proposes that starting in 2015 the same information will get reported to the Canada Revenue Agency and we will be able to use this information to verify the accuracy of information provided by taxpayers who engage in foreign financial transactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249278">Another really important program, which has been tried in other countries, and the banks all indicated last week that could be a very important tool, is the international tax evasion whistleblower initiative. In budget 2013, we announced our intention to launch a new initiative to encourage individuals to report information about international tax evasion and avoidance and, if eligible, receive a payment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249279">In addition to these measures, budget 2013 proposes a number of other tools to assist CRA in combatting international tax evasion and avoidance. We will extend the normal reassessment period for taxpayers who failed to properly report income related to specified foreign property, revise income verification statements to require more detailed information and streamline the process for CRA to obtain information from third parties, such as banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249280">The opposition had stated on numerous occasions that it considered the fight against international tax evasion a priority. Our government has long recognized this problem and has consistently taken steps to strengthen the CRA audit and compliance capabilities. I trust the opposition will see the importance of these measures and actually support us in budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249281">There is one other area I want to quickly focus on in terms of the Canada Revenue Agency. As many people are aware, we had a red tape reduction commission that tabled a report almost two years ago now. From that report, a number of different departments in government agreed to move further in terms of how they would take care of the issues that created an unnecessary burden on our small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249282">It is really the important reduction of red tape. It is a silent killer of jobs. It imposes crippling costs on businesses, restricts innovation, productivity, and competitiveness. It is bad for Canada and it is bad for business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249283">Last summer, as we travelled the country, we heard there were simple things we could do to make a big difference. I was at about 10 different round tables. There was a form that drove our businesses and our accountants nuts. I had never heard of it before. I think it is called a T59. It was something that was a real burden for them in how they were able to authorize someone to do their income tax work on their behalf and how they could authorize a provider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249284">That one change was specifically mentioned. We heard from Canadians and business owners and we made the changes that were necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249285">It is important to note that the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses praised the government's extraordinary efforts to reduce red tape for small business. The minister was delighted, and we were pleased to receive the Golden Scissors Award.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249286">We have many initiatives, which are actually mentioned in this budget. Our government continues to look at the important issue of reducing red tape. Other things we are intending to do is to continue making it easier for businesses to communicate with the Canada Revenue Agency. My Business Account is extremely popular. Canada Revenue Agency is responding in writing through My Business Account and standing by those decisions. There is online mail. I could go on and on, but there are many great things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249287">I would call on all opposition parties to support these important initiatives, whether it be combatting tax evasion or closing tax loopholes. They should be looking favourably at supporting the very important measures in our economic action plan.</ParaText>

I direct her attention to a table on page 287, which is the increase in the national debt during the government's administration. In this table alone, we go from $582 billion up to the better end of $634 billion before it is apparently going to magically start to decline. If we went back to when the Conservatives became government, it has gone from about $450 billion up to close to $634 billion. It has gone from less than 30% of GDP to now in the order of 34% of GDP. The take on the revenues out of the economy has gone up to 14.5%. </ParaText>

As we moved forward with what was a very important economic action plan that provided much-needed stimulus, I remember hearing the Liberals and NDP saying, “Spend more, spend more, spend more”. In actual fact, had we listened to them, that debt would be much higher than it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249296">The results speak for themselves. If we look at Canada's results with the lowest net debt to GDP ratio and job creation, we see very clearly that we have a plan that is working. Our plan is to get back to a balance budget by 2015. It is not doing what the Liberals did, which was to cut health care transfers to the provinces. We are going to do it by creating jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249302">I know the government wants us to vote with it and wants everyone in the House of Commons to agree with it. That is the kind of Conservative government we have right now. It believes it is right about everything, and everyone else is wrong and their ideas are all bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249303">Before I begin my speech, I would like to talk about something that worries me. The government wants to offer tax cuts to people who make charitable donations for the first time. It wants to transfer all the work, all the responsibilities of the government, onto people who will do it on a volunteer basis, people who make donations. It is no longer the government that will provide assistance, but rather Canadians, and this will come from a tax cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249304">Meanwhile, the Conservatives refuse to recognize that the Fonds de solidarité FTQ, for instance—an $8.8 billion fund that, since its creation 30 years ago, has injected $10 billion into Quebec's economy—has created and safeguarded 500,000 jobs since 1990.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249305">With this fund, governments get their money back in three years. Sixty per cent of the capital is invested in businesses in Quebec and the rest of Canada. There are 2,239 partner businesses. Approximately 200,000 Quebeckers invested in an RRSP for the first time by investing in the fund. We have to consider that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249306">The 12-month return is 4.7% and the average 10-year return is 10%. The goal of this fund is to assist workers. We should not forget that one of its objectives is to help workers save money for their retirement while creating and saving jobs. It is the best plan Canada has ever had, and the Conservatives are getting rid of it. That is unbelievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249307">I wonder what workers or the unions have done to this government for it to hate them so much. There are just two questions, and that is where the problem lies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249308">I would like to come back to what is happening in my area. Earlier, the member spoke about the Conservatives' tour of the regions. Could she tell me who on the Conservative team went to northeastern New Brunswick to see what is happening to seasonal workers? The fishing industry has collapsed and in the forestry industry, pulp and paper plants in Miramichi, Bathurst and Dalhousie have closed. The Brunswick mine will be closing at the end of the month, with the loss of 800 good jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249309">The government is supposed to be helping people across the country. Instead of helping Canadian workers and those in my region, the Conservatives are eliminating the worker training program. I believe that the parliamentary secretary, or one of the members opposite, let something slip this morning. She said that they had to train people out west. That is why the Conservatives took that money. I am not supposed to use the word “steal”, but the truth is that they took money from the 2013 budget to provide training out west. That is what they want to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249310">Who will use that program? One can only imagine. The government will invest up to $5,000 for every worker and the province will have to match $5,000 for that same worker. The employer will also have to put in $5,000. I do not see how small businesses back home will be able to contribute $5,000 an employee. They did not have to do so before, because New Brunswick—much like Quebec and other Canadian provinces—was responsible for training workers in the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249311">The government is now saying that it wants to have this money to train workers and send them out west. We can see how open the government is towards Canadian workers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249331">If we want to create jobs, we need to invest in infrastructure, for example. Shutting down the VIA Rail line between Moncton and Bathurst will not help create jobs. We need to invest in a much needed airport in northern New Brunswick. That is what the Conservatives should be investing in. They need to provide training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249332">If we want to do something good for the workers and tradespeople, then agreements need to be established between the provinces. That way, a tradesperson who has completed a course in one province but has not managed to find a job in that province could work in another province, and the class hours could be recognized as hours of work, which is currently not the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249333">This type of agreement needs to be negotiated and established between the provinces. Then, when jobs are created in our regions, our people will be trained and can come back home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249334">Let us come back to the job posting. I can understand why it says that education is not required and that the only requirement is five years of experience. Since people from my region who go there to work as scaffolders are not being offered training, that means that no one is being trained. Even if they did have the training, they would not have five years of experience. So what is the result? Temporary foreign workers are hired to come and work here. That is the excuse Canadian businesses are using to bring foreign workers here and pay them 15% less than Canadian workers. It is cheap labour. That is what that means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249335">The Conservatives have crucified people in my region by making cuts to employment insurance, seasonal work, the fisheries and the forestry industry. They have not done anything to help New Brunswick's economy. This budget is cutting $4.6 billion in infrastructure over the next four years. Yet the Conservatives are boasting that they are investing in infrastructure. There is a reason why Maurice Martin, a man from the southeastern part of the province, has been on a hunger strike against this government for 17 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249336">It is shameful. They never even phoned him. They will never do anything to try to help the people in my region, despite everything that is happening there.

              <ParaText id="3249337">The Conservatives are even going to tax people who park in hospital parking lots and students who park at universities. Yet they say that they will not tax people. What planet are they are living on? It is certainly not the same one as the rest of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249338">I can guarantee that the Conservatives will never get our vote, because they have caused nothing but misery for the people in my region. There can be a better vision for our country, our workers, and our companies and businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249343">Mr. Speaker, if we look at the workers for example, the government is transferring the costs of retirement to the provinces because people will end up on welfare. Those workers in big industries who have pension plans will probably take their retirement at the age of 60. However, not everyone has those pension plans. We get calls in our office from workers across the country saying that it just does not make any sense. I hate to say it but some of them even say that they cannot wait until age 65 to stop working because they are burning out. The men and women who work so hard in the bush and the women working in the fish plants will never have a pension plan in their lives. With all respect, I just do not see them working in the fish plants until the age of 67. They are burning out because they work 14 to 16 hours a day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249344">That is the respect the government has for the workers because it hates the workers.

It is stunning in its insensitivity. In the budget, the Conservatives introduced a new measure aimed at first nation youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249365">All members in the House know about the substandard education that exists among first nation communities. Statistics show special needs identification and placement rates in first nation elementary and secondary schools. Approximately 47% of first nations currently need a new school. Approximately 74% of first nation schools currently require major repairs. Only 46% of first nation schools have a fully equipped gym and so on. On top of that, 32% of schools have an issue with access to clean drinking water. With all that, between 2004 and 2009, the graduation rate on first nations was approximately 36%, compared to the rate of 72% in the general population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249366">During the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s meeting with first nation leaders in January, he promised again to renew the government's approach to issues such as these. However, in this budget, there is no new money for first nation schools. They still face a 30% shortfall for another year. Children fighting for an education in communities such as Lac-Simon or Lac de l'Orange will receive considerably less than other students in provincial schools. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249367">On the other hand, the government decided to introduce training funds for aboriginal youth, but with one major caveat. To qualify, first nation communities have to agree that recipients of income assistance programs undergo specific job training. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3249375">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the House of Commons on private member's Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document>, an act respecting the rights of air passengers, which was introduced in this chamber in November of last year. Our government strongly supports consumer protection measures, however, the bill is fundamentally flawed and would likely have impacts contrary to what it seeks to achieve. Furthermore, it is redundant given the passenger protection approach that already exists in Canada and this government's effort to strengthen it in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249376">Let me start by noting that the bill calls for all-in advertising. I am pleased to remind the House that our Conservative government has already put in place these measures by way of regulations that were brought into force in December 2012, following extensive consultation with industry, consumers and other stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249377">Beyond that, Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> proposes a prescriptive regime that would increase the regulatory burden on air carriers and on travellers. It would introduce additional costs into our air transport system and it would not improve the passenger protection approach that already exists in this country. In Canada today, airline passengers are protected through provisions in the Canada Transportation Act. All carriers operating in Canada, or arriving or departing from Canada, are required to develop terms and conditions of carriage that they must respect. They must make those terms and conditions readily accessible to passengers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249378">The Air Transportation Regulations under the act specify the items that must be included in the terms and conditions of carriage, such as the carrier's policies regarding cancelled or delayed flights, lost or damaged luggage, and denied boarding due to overbooking. This establishes a clear basis on which passengers can raise concerns if they feel they have not been treated appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249379">The Canadian Transportation Agency is mandated to resolve travellers' complaints by examining whether the carriers are acting in compliance with their terms and conditions of carriage and by assessing the reasonableness of the terms and conditions. The act also includes significant provisions to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249380">If a traveller is not able to resolve his or her issues directly with the carrier and submits a formal complaint to the agency, the agency would begin by seeking a mutually satisfactory solution to the problem by way of alternative dispute resolution. If this is not successful, arbitration is an option. We know that in fact most complaints are resolved by way of mediation. In some instances, the agency has found that a carrier's terms and conditions of carriage are not reasonable, resulting in significant changes to the benefit of passengers. Recent such decisions have addressed questions such as lost baggage and denied boarding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249381">In short, our current system works. Furthermore, it does so because of the proactive stance that our Conservative government has taken on passenger rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249382">In 2007, we took action to strengthen the consumer protection regime for air travellers by introducing measures as part of Bill <Document DbId="2172053" Type="3">C-11, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>. These amendments improved the transparency of carriers' terms and conditions of carriage and made the complaint process under the Canadian Transportation Agency permanent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249383">In 2008, we introduced Flight Rights Canada, an initiative to inform Canadians of their rights under the act. This also resulted in the creation of a plain language voluntary code of practice, which our major carriers adopted into their terms and conditions of carriage. I have already mentioned the airfare advertising regulations brought into force last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249384">The prescriptive regulatory regime proposed in <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> is not consistent with Canada's approach to consumer protection in transport. As written, the bill raises a number of questions and creates systems that would ultimately increase the burden on all parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249385">To begin with, the proposed bill would only empower the agency to enforce provisions relating to duty to disclose pricing, announcements at airports and obligations to inform passengers of their rights at check-in. With respect to other matters such as cancellations, delays and denied boarding, consumers would seemingly have to seek redress through the courts if they are not satisfied with a carrier's response. This would be costly, time-consuming and a burden on the passengers as well as on the Canadian court system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249386">Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> seeks to address concerns that were identified with previous private members' bills on this subject, which made air carriers responsible for problems that are the fault of other parties, such as airports or navigation providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249387">However, the current bill would introduce a new regulatory burden, namely that carriers would need to make a submission to the Canadian Transportation Agency proving the third party's responsibility. This would result in more red tape for the carriers and more work for the agency. The additional costs, obviously, would likely be borne by travellers and taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249388">Furthermore, the bill would recognize that carriers would not be made responsible for cancellations arising as a result of <I>force majeure</I>, particularly weather. The carriers would remain responsible for the situation resulting from <I>force majeure</I>, such as airport or tarmac delays, and we all know that weather is a major factor in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249389">The bill would create confusion between its provisions and the current provisions of the Canada Transportation Act. There is also potential conflict between Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> and the Carriage by Air Act, which brings into force passengers' rights provisions enshrined in the Montreal convention, an international treaty to which Canada is a party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249390">In conclusion, we are committed to promoting passengers' rights by way of an approach that minimizes costs and regulatory burden on all travellers in the air industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249391">Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> would add nothing to this, but it does have the potential to significantly increase the regulatory burden and cost to Canada's air transportation sector and to create confusion within the regulatory regime without further addressing passenger needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249392">For this reason, we cannot support Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249395">For many years we have seen a great deal of consumer frustration with airlines. Once one gets to the airport, there are problems getting onto the aircraft and with departures, arrivals and luggage. There have been a litany of horror stories, and they continue today.

              <ParaText id="3249397">First, just to illustrate our concerns, a colleague of mine introduced a motion in 2008. It was M-465. It is a very short motion, which I will read into the record:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call upon the government to bring forward an airline passenger bill of rights similar in scope and effect to legal instruments being either proposed or enacted by jurisdictions within Europe and the United States for the purpose of protecting passenger interests in a consistent and rules-based way and to provide a means of ensuring adequate compensation...by the airline industry to airline passengers who experience inconveniences such as flight interruptions, delays, cancellations, issues with checked baggage and other inconveniences incurred while travelling on commercial passenger airline services originating from anywhere in Canada.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249399">This motion was brought forward by the Liberal party by one of my colleagues back in April 2008. What is most interesting is that at the time, it passed the House unanimously. All political parties were supportive of the motion, and justifiably so. If we were to canvass our constituents, we would find wide support for motions, bills or legislation of this nature. We were encouraged that it actually garnered the support of all parties in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249400">Not that much later, the government attempted to bring in legislation that they referred to as “flight rights Canada”. It was a government initiative and was an attempt to deal with the issue. However, there was a serious flaw. There really were no regulations that followed that provided some teeth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249401">As a result, we see the types of issues raised five, six or seven years ago being raised today. In part, it is because the government has decided that it is not an important enough issue for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249402">That is why I was interested in the previous speaker saying that the Conservatives did not believe there was a need to support this bill. I would disagree. The Conservatives have very little to lose by at least allowing the bill to go to committee where we could possibly amend it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249403"> The reason I read the motion to remind members was to reinforce the fact that there was a time in which MPs of all political parties supported the importance of consumer rights within our airline industry. It would appear that the Conservative Party is starting to back away in terms of recognizing those consumer rights. Therefore, I encourage the government to give more reflection and consider the benefits to consumers by at the very least allowing the bill to go to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249404">Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> had been introduced in another form, by the former member for Elmwood—Transcona, someone I knew reasonably well from the House and from serving together in the Manitoba legislature. From what Mr. Maloway talked about when he introduced his bill, it is fair to say that Canadians responded well to it. For that the reason, I reinforce the fact that not only would people from Winnipeg benefit, as I represent Winnipeg residents, and Mr. Maloway used to as a member of Parliament, but it would benefit people far beyond Winnipeg or Manitoba.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249405"> Our busiest airports, whether Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Montreal or Halifax, coast to coast, all have significant increase in traffic. Looking to the future, as airline tickets continue to be reasonably affordable on a larger scale as more consumers find themselves in a position where they can afford to fly, the demand for this type of legislation, if crafted correctly, would be of great value and benefit. That is the reason we need to look at how we can bring in legislation that would protect the interests of the consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249406">When a flight has been cancelled or delayed, there are circumstances beyond an airline's control. An example of that would be a number of weeks when we get whiteouts, or snowstorms or things that are beyond the ability of airlines to control. It is understandable that we would see airlines being cancelled or delayed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249407"> Then again, there are other issues that cause passengers a great deal of concern in why a flight has been delayed yet another hour or two hours. It might relate to maintenance and to what degree proper diligence was done by the airline, or the amount of time which one had to spend due to misplaced luggage. My son's mother-in-law came for a visit from the States and had her luggage all torn up, and it had to be wrapped in plastic. The luggage was replaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249408"> Very real issues are happening in that whole industry. It is an industry that will be growing into the future. It would be wonderful to have legislation and regulations to protect consumers. Not only would Winnipeg North residents want to see something of that nature, I argue all Canadians would welcome consumer-friendly airline industry legislation and regulations.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3249409">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="170249" Type="2">Laval</Affiliation> for his bill, which is designed to protect the rights of Canadian families, small businesses and business travellers by creating an air passenger bill of rights. It is an important initiative that would strengthen consumer protection by establishing clear compensation rules and by penalizing companies at fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249410">To begin, I should point out that a number of airlines already have good business practices. We acknowledge that and congratulate those companies, but, unfortunately, the same cannot be said of all the airlines, and that is why this bill is so important and so necessary. It is important because it targets carriers that have developed bad practices in order to gouge customers. I am thinking, in particular, about airlines that overbook or deliberately cancel flights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249411">Basically, this bill is designed to protect consumers by discouraging bad practices and by forcing greater standardization within the airline market. These worthwhile objectives would have a positive impact on both consumers and airlines that already have exemplary practices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249412">More specifically, the airline passenger bill of rights proposed by this bill would protect passengers in certain situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249413">First, when a flight is cancelled, passengers would be entitled to reimbursement or a seat on the next available flight. They would also be entitled to a meal depending on the delay, as well as to compensation, if necessary. Should the airline not meet its obligations, it would have to pay each passenger $500. In addition, companies that voluntarily cancel a flight would be required to compensate all passengers between $250 and $600, an amount that would be determined based on the distance of the flight canceled by the company, not to exceed the total amount paid by the passenger for the flight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249414">Second, passengers would be entitled to compensation when an airline refuses to let them board because of overbooking. This happens when an airline sells more tickets than it has seats on a flight. This tactic is used by some companies that count on the fact that certain passengers will not show up for the flight. Therefore, they sell more tickets than they have seats available. This dubious practice does not cause problems when certain passengers do not show up, but when enough passengers do, the company must refuse to allow certain passengers to board, passengers who had reserved and paid for their airline ticket. Under this bill, companies that refuse to allow a passenger to board because the flight is overbooked would have to pay $250 to $600 in compensation. Once again, that amount would be determined based on the distance of the flight the passenger was prevented from boarding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249415">Third, when a flight is delayed, passengers would be entitled to meals, refreshments and accommodation, based on the length of the delay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249416">Fourth, passengers would be entitled to compensation in the amount of $500 if their baggage is misplaced by the airline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249417">This bill obviously goes into much more detail than what I just mentioned. It gives air passengers clear rules about compensation and reimbursement. It prevents Canadian families' vacations from being disrupted as a result of the poor practices of certain airlines. It ensures that entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized business owners who regularly use air transport will be compensated when airlines do not respect their commitments. It standardizes practices in the air industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249418">All of these measures work. For almost 10 years now, several countries in Europe have had such measures in place and have proven that they are effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249419">How can anyone be against measures that protect consumer rights and that work well?</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3249420">Some of my colleagues from the other side of the House seem to think that the system we have in place is sufficient to ensure that passengers and families are treated fairly by air carriers. They seem to believe that since it is in the best interest of the companies to treat their customers fairly that they will do so to prevent customers from switching air carriers for their next travel arrangements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249421">That might be true in some cases, but what happens when things do not work out that way? What happens when an air carrier decides not to compensate passengers adequately for a situation in which the company is responsible? What happens when passengers and families are stuck at the airport for hours without any help or services from the air carrier?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249422">The answer is quite simple. The passengers have to pay for the services they need, including food and housing, and if they do not have the means to do so they have to wait and sleep at the airport terminal, which is not nearly as entertaining as Tom Hanks would lead us to believe. Let us not forget that many Canadians, such as a family who has maxed out their credit card for their vacation and are travelling on a limited budget, do not have the financial means to pay for such unexpected expenses, especially in these times where Canadian families are overburdened with debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249423">The fact is that passengers who feel they were treated unfairly may receive some compensation through informal facilitation or some form of adjudication by the Canadian Transportation Agency, but that does not solve the problem. It does not provide those passengers and families with the service they need at the time they need it. It is more red tape for a Canadian family to go through to be reimbursed for the trouble they have suffered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249424">It is easy to say that all they have to do is pay for the food and hotel room since they might receive some compensation many months later. However, as I said, not everyone has the financial means to pay for such unexpected expenses, especially when they know they might not get their money back in the end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249425">This is one of the reasons that this bill is important for consumer rights. It would make sure that passengers have access to reasonable and free services when they are forced to stay at the airport for an extended period of time. When a flight is cancelled, if the air carrier does not provide those services free of charge, it would have to compensate the passengers with a fixed amount of $500.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249426">This bill of rights for passengers would prevent those air carriers who have developed bad practices from benefiting from them. They would probably abandon practices such as overbooking and voluntary cancellations of flights. As for those carriers who do not use such money-making tactics, they would not be penalized with this new bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249427"> If an air carrier is not responsible for a flight delay or a flight cancellation, in other words, if the cancellation or delay of a flight is the result of a measure or decision taken by an airport authority, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, Nav Canada, or the Canada Border Services Agency, the air carrier may submit the matter to the Canadian Transportation Agency. If the air carrier was indeed not responsible for the situation, it would be compensated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249428">In short, this bill would make sure that passengers, families and small business owners are treated fairly by every air carrier. By creating such consistency across the industry, it would also benefit those air carriers that have good practices and do not try to make more money from their customers by overbooking or cancelling flights. In the end, the bill would benefit everyone but those companies who would try to shortchange consumers.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3249429">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of the wonderful bill put forward by my friend the member for <Affiliation DbId="170249" Type="2">Laval</Affiliation> to try to put some structure around how Canadians are treated by airlines in our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249430">The Conservative government believes that the aviation system has to be protected to the point of legislating private companies back to work even before there is a labour dispute. We can only wonder why the government is not supportive of something that would protect the rights of consumers when it is so eager to protect its corporate fans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249431">The consumers involved here are people who take flights throughout Canada. Canada being the large and disparate country that it is, the use of airlines is necessary for some travel within Canada and is often the only way to get quickly from point A to point B. This is because we do not have the infrastructure for a high-speed rail system, as some countries do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249432">Airlines know that there is an oligopoly in the country, with only two major carriers. As a result, they really have Canadians at their mercy when it comes to how they treat them in the event of cancellations, overbooking or lost luggage. There is no formal regulatory system to insist that airlines do the right thing by their passengers. Some do, and we are not here to criticize those airlines, but we are opposed to airlines that treat their passengers shoddily. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249433">We believe that the time has come to create, as already exists in Europe, a passenger bill of rights, such that when an airline treats passengers badly or when an airline chooses to cancel or overbook a flight, it is on the hook for some compensation for those people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249434">The airline certainly will not put back the missed meeting, the missed birthday, the missed wedding or any of the other things that Canadians rely on airlines to get them to on time. One of the reasons we use planes is that we want to get to a place on time; the airline will not replace those things, but it will offer some measure of compensation. The same is true for businesspeople, who cannot replace a missed meeting or make up for not meeting face to face with the client they had hoped to woo into investing in their company. These things will not be replaced, but they may get a few dollars out of it at least, to help them feel a little bit better about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249435">The best way to speak on this matter is to offer some examples of what happens to real passengers when airlines treat them shabbily. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249436">My family was booked on an Air Canada flight, but it turned out that an American airline was providing a portion of the travel. The American airline, which I will not name in order to avoid finger pointing, decided to cancel the flight. I was travelling with a one-year-old, and we ended up in a very stark and dismal airport for the better part of 14 hours while we waited for the replacement flight they had promised us. We were there from 9 in the morning until almost 11 o'clock at night waiting for the replacement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249437">All through the day, we were trying to find another way to get to where we were going. When I investigated, the airline said they had had to cancel the plane because of weather problems in the other city. Canadians will accept that weather is a big part of what we have here and that it may in fact cause problems, so I accepted this reason at face value at that point in time. However, I checked later on, and there was no weather in that city. It was a beautiful, dry, sunny, calm day in the city that they claimed had weather problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249438">What was going on was what airlines sometimes do. The airline realized that it had a very light load on the plane. When a plane has maybe only 30 passengers but could seat 50 and the next plane to the same city has a similar situation, the airline will combine the two flights. This happens all the time, and the airlines do not tell us they are doing it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249439">If one looks at the board and sees the planes that go between, say, Toronto and Ottawa, for example, and one of them says “cancelled”, chances are that one of the reasons it is cancelled is that it has a light load and the airline wants to combine flights to save money. That is all well and good, but by bumping people off their scheduled flights, they miss their connections and they miss the meetings, the birthdays, the weddings or the funerals. How does that repay people? It does not. The airlines at the moment do not have any obligation whatsoever when they do this kind of thing. That is one example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249440">I have another example. When my son in Alberta was coming for a surprise visit last November, his flight from Edmonton to Toronto was going through Calgary. When he got to the airport in Edmonton, there was a big snowstorm in Calgary. Did they say anything to him in Edmonton, before he got on that plane, about the fact that the Calgary portion of his flight had been cancelled? No. They knew it, but they did not want to give him the opportunity to say that he wanted his money back and that he would not go with Air Canada but would go with WestJet. Instead, they assured him that his plane would go. He actually asked, because he knew there was a snowstorm in Calgary, and he was told that it was going and not to worry. Of course, he got to Calgary at 10 o'clock in the morning and was told there would be no flights until the next day, at which point the trip was completely wasted. There was no point in coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249441">As one can imagine, there was a lot of chaos at the airport in Calgary as thousands upon thousands of people tried to make other arrangements to get somewhere when weather caused the airport to be messed up. There was only one agent on duty for a very long line of people. To add insult to the injury of not being able to get from point A to point B, people had to stand in line—there were no chairs in the line—for hours to rebook their flights, cancel their flights or go back to where they were coming from. Yes, it is true that it was ultimately caused by weather, but the airline should never have allowed him to get on the plane in Edmonton in the first place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249442">That is part of what this bill would do. When an airline knows that there is going to be a cancellation, it would be up to the airline to inform the passengers that there will be a cancellation. I can understand why the airline would not want to do that. It wants to keep the money and wants people to travel and use that airline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249443">The other issue this bill would deal with is lost luggage. I am sure that most of us here have experienced lost luggage at some point in their careers. I know that I have. What is the airline's response when people lose their luggage? People are told to buy more underwear and send the airline the bill. There is no immediate recompense. It does not immediately provide money for people to buy underwear. For kids travelling to university with nothing in their pockets but their student cards, it is a little difficult, faced with no luggage, to keep going to school every day in the same pair of underwear. The airlines do not supply it. They simply say that people have to buy it and send them the receipts. This bill would provide some recompense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249444">The final part of this bill is the piece dealing with airlines charging extras when they show people the price. The airlines in Canada are very sneaky with this stuff. Air Canada has something called a fuel surcharge. Between here and London, England, it is $206 for people in regular class and $315 for people in business class. If we add up all the people on the plane and all the fuel charges, it is more than for actually filling up the plane's tank. It charges more in the fuel surcharge than the fuel actually costs. The statement on its website is that it is to provide for fluctuations in operating costs caused by varying fuel prices. That is not the case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249445">It also charges a NAV CANADA surcharge, which is to reflect the fact that it is an airline and has to fly. NAV CANADA does not charge per passenger. It charges per plane. It is $5,000 or so per plane. It does not break it down per passenger. The airline does. It tries to make it sound as if these are government charges. I am sorry, but we are not in charge of this. The government is not in charge of whether there is an insurance fee to be paid or a NAV CANADA fee to be paid by the airline. That is a private matter between the airline and NAV CANADA.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249446">This is a good bill. This is a bill that would give Canadian passengers some footing in their debates with airlines and would give them some rights. I am proud to support it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3249447">Mr. Speaker, my colleague's bill addresses a significant need in Canada regarding the rights of air passengers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249448">This issue can affect all Canadians, anyone who uses air travel. Indeed, some problems that can arise during a flight do not happen in other forms of travel. Whether it involves a cancelled or delayed flight, lost baggage, or if boarding is denied, these things can happen to anyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249449">Many incidents can arise during air travel. Accordingly, passengers' rights need to be protected any time airlines are treating their passengers unfairly. Compensation rules and requirements for the carriers need to be imposed in order to ensure that travellers are not put at a disadvantage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249450">The bill places obligations on air carriers to provide compensation and other assistance to passengers in certain cases when a flight has been cancelled or delayed, when boarding has been denied, and when an aircraft has remained on the ground for a period of more than an hour at an airport. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249451">It also requires air carriers to disclose all relevant information to the public regarding the pricing of flights and to keep passengers informed regarding any misplaced baggage and any developments in respect of their flights that could have a significant impact on their travel plans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249452">These rights apply in certain situations. First of all, when a flight is cancelled, passengers have the right to be reimbursed or re-routed to their final destination. They are entitled to meals based on the length of the delay, and to accommodation, if necessary. They are entitled to compensation in the amount of $250 to $600, unless the flight is cancelled due to extraordinary circumstances or if passengers agree to be re-routed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249453">Second, when travellers are denied boarding as a result of overbooking on the part of an airline, passengers are entitled to compensation in the amount of $250 to $600, as well as any benefits offered by the airline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249454">Third, when a flight is delayed, passengers are entitled to meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time, as well as accommodation, if necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249455">Fourth, when baggage is misplaced, passengers are entitled to $500 in compensation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249456">Fifth, when the advertised price is wrong, airlines must include all costs to be assumed by the airline, as well as all duties, fees and taxes that they collect on behalf of other parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249457">This bill takes a page from European legislation that has been in place for several years. It must be said that we are lagging far behind in that respect. European regulations establish compensation for passengers when they have problems with air transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249458">If a flight is overbooked or cancelled, the passenger is entitled to financial compensation. Airlines are always required to provide assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249459">This month, the European Commission announced a number of measures to provide air passengers with new rights and better access to good information and assistance when they are stranded at an airport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249460">New procedures to handle complaints and new enforcement measures are also included in order for passengers to obtain what they are entitled to. Oversight of airlines by domestic and European authorities will be strengthened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249461">Even persons with disabilities are better served under the rules established by the European Union. The regulations adopted in 2006 are based on the simple principle that persons with disabilities should have the same opportunity to travel by air.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249462">The regulations on the rights of people with reduced mobility when using air transport prohibits operators from refusing to make a reservation or board passengers because of a disability. However, there are some exceptions due to safety reasons established by law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249463">The person with reduced mobility must be informed of the refusal, together with the reasons, within five days of making the reservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249464">Persons with disabilities are also entitled to obtain, from airport authorities, free assistance at airports and aboard aircraft. These services are funded by a levy collected from the airline companies. European Union countries also impose penalties and have independent organizations to deal with complaints.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3249465">This is the approach we should take in Canada, given how successful the common rules for the compensation of air passengers instituted by the European Union in 2004 have been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249466">If Europeans have such rights, then Canadians should have them too. Europeans do not hesitate to exercise their rights when they feel they have a valid complaint against an airline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249467">Whether passengers have been denied boarding or downgraded, or their flight has been significantly delayed or cancelled, these are forms of abuse, and we must legislate to prevent them from happening again. If people think that they have a legitimate complaint against an airline because they have been denied boarding or downgraded, or their flight has been significantly delayed or cancelled, they must be able to exercise their rights without any hesitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249468">It is simply a matter of logic. Travellers should receive a refund or compensation for their trip if it is cancelled. Consequently, travellers must have access to clear rules regarding refunds or compensation in the event that the airline changes their travel itinerary without two weeks' notice. Otherwise, many Canadian families' vacations will end up being disrupted simply because of an airline's bad practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249469">If airlines do not honour their commitments, they must compensate travellers. This bill is a good approach in terms of respectful relations between airlines and travellers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249470">We need to put rules in place to protect the rights of consumers by working with airlines. Quite frankly, some airlines have really good practices. Others, however, quite commonly engage in practices that are harmful to consumers, such as overbooking and cancelling flights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249471">When such situations occur, it is important to ensure that travellers are compensated by the airline. Reasonable compensation for travellers would be provided depending on the situation and the damage done, without creating false expectations on the part of the traveller.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249472">It is true that some airlines already have good compensation practices in place, but that is not the case for all of them. This bill would penalize only the airlines that take advantage of consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249473">It is common practice among some airlines to offer refunds only to passengers who are refused boarding. When flights are overbooked, which happens often, people are not usually reimbursed. Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document> would also provide compensation to passengers who end up in that situation, based on the distance of the flight in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249474">I already hear the Conservatives saying that no one can control the weather, that not all the blame can be put on the airlines and that some of the responsibility lies elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249475">That is why this bill allows for exceptions when it is not the airline's fault. For example, passengers will not receive compensation in the case of a cancelled flight caused by extraordinary circumstances that could not have been avoided. In the case of extraordinary circumstances, airlines do not have to provide the compensation set out in Bill <Document DbId="5802605" Type="4">C-459</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249476">That is the essence of the bill that would create a fairer relationship between passengers and airlines, something that has existed in Europe for many years. It will be particularly beneficial to middle-class Canadian families and SME owners. Whether we are talking about a family vacation, a business trip or any other kind of travel, passengers will not end up powerless and will have rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249477">There is currently a serious legislative gap to be filled, and the bill introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170249" Type="2">Laval</Affiliation> fills the major gap we have in Canada. We must ultimately ensure that passengers are properly compensated when there is a problem at the airport.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3249479">Mr. Speaker, given the remarks of my official opposition and government colleagues, it seems even clearer to me that a bill such as the one I have introduced is essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249480">Like me, members on the other side of the House have demonstrated their support for air passengers. My Conservative colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>, who chairs the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, was quite right when he said: “Consumers have the right to expect to be treated fairly by airlines.” That was on February 7 of this year. What he said is a fact, and it points to the problems that led to the drafting of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249481">Comments by some government members lead us to believe that existing mechanisms already allow for impartial inquiries when individuals feel they have received unsatisfactory treatment from an airline. That is not true. Many airlines do not see why they should be proactive when it comes to passengers' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249482">The current legislation does not encourage being proactive in the least—quite the opposite, actually. Canada's policy on passengers' rights is based on a disconcerting dichotomy of intimidation and insecurity. The intimidation starts with the very first paragraph on the ticket purchase agreement, where it states that the buyer agrees that the airline assumes no responsibility. Insecurity is created in collusion with insurance companies, which try to force consumers to buy protection. Both aspects employ mechanisms that require passengers to file a complaint themselves in order to receive compensation for the airline's negligence. This bill addresses that approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249483">The air passengers' bill of rights that we are discussing today will require all airlines doing business in Canada—apart from the clearly indicated exceptions—to comply with standards for respecting passengers' rights. The main objective is to regulate the sector, as is already the case in Europe, so that compensation for a change in travel plans becomes the standard and not the result of long, expensive legal proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249484">All it takes is talking to a few victims of bad practices to understand just how very long and particularly awkward the compensation process can be. We must recognize that some airlines already offer good compensation. Moreover they are not necessarily the ones that offer very expensive tickets, as some government colleagues claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3249485">The goal of the bill is to standardize the practices of airlines when it comes to compensation and, at the same time, to ensure that the rights of passengers are protected fairly and reasonably. We are trying to eliminate misunderstandings and the frustration that result from these abnormal situations.</ParaText>
