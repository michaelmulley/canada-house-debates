The part that I am presenting today has over 6,000 signatures, about a quarter of the total number of signatures. This petition asks, first, that the existing budgets, which are insufficient for the renovation, improvement and modernization of social housing, be maintained. Second, the petition asks that the government commit to maintaining the long-term funding granted to social housing units built before 1994, particularly those that subsidize low-income tenants so that they can pay rent calculated according to their income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861060">The government must therefore maintain existing subsidies and renew them when they expire to provide these people with affordable housing.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="2861082">Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a), the National Energy Board, NEB, regulates pipelines owned and operated by Montreal Pipe Line Limited. The NEB has not completed any environmental assessments under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act for projects by Montreal Pipe Line Limited since 2002.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861083"> 

However, the NEB continues to monitor the pipeline to ensure that it is safe. For example, as part of the six applications from Montreal Pipe Line Limited for deactivation or decommissioning of pipelines and one application for transfer of ownership of a pipeline received by the NEB, the environmental issues were considered as part of its public interest mandate in its regulatory decision-making under the National Energy Board Act.
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861084">With regard to (b), no application to modify or upgrade the pipeline has been submitted to the NEB at this time.

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861085">With regard to (c), the current emergency manuals on file with the NEB are as follows: integrated contingency plan--Portland Pipe Line and Montreal Pipe Line Limited--part A; Montreal Pipe Line Limited oil spill specific response plans--part B; emergency response action plan--part C; and Montreal pipeline system and  Montreal east terminal and north tank field.
</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861086">The manuals include information on critical areas to protect, environmental and socio-economic sensitivities and wildlife protection and rehabilitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861087">An emergency response manual assessment was conducted by the NEB on June 21, 2010. Furthermore, a critical information check was conducted on January 5, 2012. Based on these assessments, it was noted that Montreal Pipe Line Limited has an incomplete “incident” definition based on NEB reporting requirements, as the company omitted the full definition of “incident” as outlined in the Onshore Pipeline Regulations.  In addition, the roles and responsibilities of the NEB were not properly defined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861088">The NEB sent a letter to Montreal Pipe Line Limited, identifying the areas needing correction to satisfy the NEB requirements and requesting that the company file revisions to its emergency manual. In a letter sent to the NEB on April 19, 2012, Montreal Pipe Line Limited stated that it had received the NEB’s request. The company also filed draft revisions to its emergency procedures manual. Once the NEB reviews the proposed changes and is satisfied, Montreal Pipe Line Limited will be notified, and it will file the revised emergency procedures manual with the NEB.</ParaText>

If he had respect for the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> he would have allowed debate on these amendments. Independent members of the House who did not sit at committee came forward with amendments. Our party looked at them and found some of them interesting and others very problematic. The problematic elements deserve to be debated. That is the role of Parliament.</ParaText>

All of those proposals were seen in the consultation before we drafted the bill, after we drafted the bill in the last Parliament or in consideration of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> in this Parliament. There were no new ideas there. We had seen them all before. We decided that was not the right balance that we represented and presented in our legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861190">In terms of respecting Parliament, we did not ram it through heritage or industry committee. We established a stand-alone legislative committee chaired by an NDP member of Parliament.

              <ParaText id="2861191">We have debated this for two and a half years. The bill has been before this Parliament for two years. We have considered different points of view. We arrived at our legislation. There is a five year reconsideration of this legislation built into the law in order to bring it back to Parliament for further debate on a go-forward basis. The idea that we are not respecting Parliament when we have involved Parliament all through the process and will in the future is ridiculous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861195">Mr. Speaker, the point has been made by the Liberal Party, our party, the Green Party, and even the Bloc that if the NDP members want to have substantive debate in the House of Commons on all issues, including copyright, then they might want to be honest with themselves in terms of how they approach legislation. The NDP had its finance critic consume three days of debate in a mindless filibuster, the only purpose of which was to shut the Liberals out of the debate. That was the game the NDP played. If the NDP really wants to have substantive debate, one member of Parliament taking up 13 hours of debate, which is about equal to the time for 50 members of Parliament to speak on legislation, is not the way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861196">In this Parliament, that was the greatest act of games on the budget that I have seen in years. It was done by the NDP frontbench finance critic, who proudly stood in the House of Commons and played games with the budget debate, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="170199" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> now says is so important that we get into the details on these things. If that is the case, then why did the NDP have one member of Parliament speak for three days' worth of debate in a cynical game just to block others from having an opportunity to speak? That was the NDP approach. Before the NDP throws stones at others, the member should realize she is standing in a very large, fragile glass house. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861241">Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a right to be quite concerned about Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> and what is actually happening and about the government's inability to make a number of amendments, which many would argue are dictated by common sense and which could have been made to alleviate some concerns that Canadians as a whole would have in regard to Bill C-11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861242">An example occurred yesterday when the member for <Affiliation DbId="170740" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> stood and answered a question I specifically asked in regard to a constituent. I will repeat the question, and I suspect members will be surprised by the answer. The question I posed yesterday was this. If one of the member's constituents were to purchase a CD and take it home and it happened to have a digital lock, should his constituent have the ability to put his favourite song from that CD onto an MP3 player? From a consumer's point of view, should he have the right to be able to do that, given that he has already purchased the song?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861243">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170740" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> answered very specifically, and I give him full credit for being very precise with his answer. His answer was no, and then he sat down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861244">At the time, I believed that most consumers and Canadians would be very concerned about that particular answer. It begs the question as to whether the member for Lethbridge is right. As a consumer, if I go and purchase a disc and on that disc I have identified a song that I feel quite attached to, I bring it home and put it on an MP3 player. I must confess I have three MP3 players and I have legitimately purchased a copy of some music and I put the same song on all three of my MP3 players, because these are the songs I appreciate. I have one in my office, one in my house and one in the apartment I have here in Ottawa. The member for Lethbridge would suggest that if Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> passes in its current form, it would be illegal for me to have that song on all three, even though it is for specific personal use. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861245">I do not think I am alone. I would suggest there are hundreds, if not thousands, of constituents who the member for <Affiliation DbId="170740" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> and all of us represent, who would likely do something similar. I have spoken in the past in regard to music and how individuals, in an era in which we used to have records, would identify the songs they liked and they would record them onto a cassette and they would be able to play that cassette. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861246">Times have changed and now we have this digital format, and it is important that we respect the artist and recognize the incredible contribution Canadian artists make to our economy and our heritage. However, we also need to be concerned in regard to the type of laws and the ramifications of those laws on all Canadians. I would be first to my feet to defend and protect the interests of those artists, but on the other hand I am also going to be first to my feet to protect consumers and their right to take personal ownership of something they have legitimately purchased.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861247">That is something on which I would challenge the government to add further comment, to provide more clarification as to what the consumer rights are in regard to that digital lock. I do not believe I am alone in wanting to be able to provide assurances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861248"> Should the bill be amended to make it okay to circumvent a digital lock, if the purpose is to use it for personal reasons such as having a backup? For individuals who have two MP3 players, should they have the right to be able to take that song they have acquired and put it on both of their MP3 players?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861249">I think those are legitimate consumer-oriented questions that are worth debate and discussion. We know the government put limitations on that particular debate today through time allocation. It is not the first time it has used time allocation, which is most unfortunate, and it does cause concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861250">The idea of copyright is something that, in principle, we have supported in the past.

              <ParaText id="2861254">He points out that what is called technological property protection measures or digital rights management has often met with consumer resistance. He says that buyers of compact disks found they could not copy them to play on their computer or in their car. They bought a video disk in England and moved to Canada. They found it would not play on North American disk players. Users found copyright holders had sometimes invaded their privacy and compromised the security of their computer to monitor what was being done with the copyright material.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861259">Madam Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861260">Let me start by reminding my colleagues that we are now closer than we have been in the last 15 years to modernizing the Copyright Act. During that time new technologies have fostered new ways to create and use copyrighted material, as well as new distribution models and consumer products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861261">Digital technologies have changed the way Canadians work, live and engage locally and globally. The emergence of the Internet has blurred the lines between users, creators, producers and distributors of copyrighted materials. All this has created a new world that the Copyright Act must adjust to and reflect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861262">Just some 15 years ago, many of the works protected by copyright were primarily available in physical formats such as paper for printed books, VHS cassettes for movies, or cartridges for video games; today, creative works are becoming increasingly available to consumers in digital formats over the Internet. Consumers can buy an e-book, stream a movie or download a game directly to their game console.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861263">Given this new reality, it is important to pass the copyright modernization act. The copyright modernization act includes provisions that are technology-neutral and reflect the reality of an ever-evolving media and technological landscape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861264">Effective copyright protection is key to creativity, innovation, citizen engagement and economic growth. Modernizing Canada's Copyright Act just makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861265">We need to make sure our copyright law is responsive to today's digital reality so that we continue to benefit from the rapid expansion of the knowledge-based economy. This is why modernizing the Copyright Act is a priority for our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861266">The Copyright Act is a complex legal framework. There are many perspectives to be heard and balanced when modernizing it. The Copyright Act affects consumers, creators, publishers, producers, Internet providers, educators and students. It relates to the books and websites that we read, the movies we watch, the music we listen to, the video games we play and the computer programs that we use. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861267">Our government has listened to and considered all these different perspectives as we have worked toward modernizing the Copyright Act. We heard the perspectives of thousands of Canadian businesses and stakeholder organizations on copyright modernization. This includes all the Canadians we heard from during the nationwide consultations we held in the summer of 2009. More than 1,000 Canadians attended live events across the country. An additional 8,000 written submissions were also received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861268">This also includes all the Canadians who attended or made submissions to the two legislative committees that studied the copyright modernization act. Combined, the two committees heard testimony from over 120 organizations and received over 250 written briefs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861269">Finally, it includes all of the Canadians who have informed the many hours of debate on the bill in this House and in the one before it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861270">We now need to deliver concrete results to all these Canadians by passing the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861271">The copyright modernization act returns to us today with a number of technical amendments that were adopted by the legislative committee. The committee adopted these amendments to improve the clarity and intent of certain provisions of the copyright modernization act. The committee adopted these amendments after an extensive review of the bill, along with all the testimony and submissions it received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861272">I would like to take this opportunity to tell the House about two sets of technical amendments the committee made to clarify and strengthen the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861273">The first set of amendments I would like to highlight are technical amendments the committee made to the measures that address the role of Internet service providers in facilitating the enforcement of copyright on the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861274">One of these amendments included a change to the provision addressing the notice and notice regime for Internet service providers. It amends the obligations providers have for forwarding notices received from rights holders. These amendments will ensure that Internet service providers can continue to support efforts to fight online copyright infringement without fear that events outside of their control could unintentionally expose them to liability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861275">The second amendment I would like to mention is an amendment that provides not-for-profit organizations with greater certainty in their mission to support the distribution of adapted works for the visually impaired. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would allow a not-for-profit organization acting for the benefit of persons with a print disability to make and send adapted works outside of Canada as long as the author of the work is either a Canadian or a national of the country to which it is sent. This amendment will protect not-for-profit organizations that make a good-faith mistake from being unreasonably sued for monetary damages.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861276">These technical amendments are intended to improve certain provisions of the copyright modernization act. As a result, these amendments would make it easier to implement the intent behind Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861277">All of the amendments adopted by the committee are consistent with the balanced approach our government has taken to copyright modernization. It is now time to make this approach a reality for Canadians by passing the copyright modernization act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861278">Canada's path toward this round of copyright modernization has lasted more than 15 years. We have heard from thousands of Canadians and have debated the bill extensively. We need to deliver concrete results for Canadians. By swiftly moving forward with a copyright modernization act, our government is delivering on our commitment to protect Canadian jobs, stimulate our economy and attract new investment to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861279">I invite all members in this House to deliver results to Canadians by ensuring the swift passage of the copyright modernization act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861296">Madam Speaker, as I said in my previous speech—and it bears repeating—shutting down debate is becoming a tradition. This is the 21st time this year. I do not know what more to say, but I thought it was worth pointing out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861297">First of all, this bill is exactly the same as Bill <Document DbId="5387766" Type="3">C-32</Document> from the previous Parliament. Artists were very critical of it. Now that the Conservatives have a majority, they are bringing it back. This is another perfect example of them shutting down debate. This bill creates powerful new anti-circumvention rights for content owners, who are not necessarily the creators or developers of the content. This prevents access to copyrighted works. These new provisions are backed by fines in excess of $1 million and up to five years in prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861298">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861299">
                <B>Ms. Marie-Claude Morin:</B> Yes, my colleague is absolutely right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861300">This means that digital locks, for example, will, for all practical purposes, take precedence over all other rights, including fair dealing rights for students and journalists. People are being muzzled yet again. This is really becoming a tradition with this Parliament, and it is problematic for a number of reasons. Obviously, there is the very real possibility that consumers will not be authorized to use content they have already paid for. This government claims that it stands up for consumers' rights, so I find this whole thing a little paradoxical and contradictory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861301">Digital locks take precedence over all other rights guaranteed by the Charter. Take, for example, format shifting for individuals with vision or hearing loss. These people might not be able to exercise their rights. That is discrimination. I do not think that is news to anyone here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861302"> Furthermore, where a digital lock has been used, copies made for educational purposes must be automatically erased after five days and course notes must be destroyed within 30 days of the course concluding. That would lead to serious problems for students enrolled in distance education courses. In my opinion, it is not an appropriate use of the copyright rules. A student who pays copyright fees for course materials often needs the materials even after the courses end. This is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861303"> The bill also creates new limited exceptions to the fair dealing provision of the Copyright Act, including the exceptions for educators, and exceptions for parody and satire, which once again limit freedom of expression. The exceptions do not adequately recognize the rights of creators. In fact, the exceptions facilitate consumers' access to copyright-protected content without providing new methods to compensate creators for their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861304">It is also interesting to note that, in this bill, the Conservatives have deliberately avoided addressing the issue of a possible extension of the private copying exception. It has been proven that this exception has been very effective in the past for cassettes, CDs and DVDs. However, the Conservatives do not want to apply it to new technology. Instead, the Conservatives have tried to put a populist face on all this by scaring consumers. I find this quite unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861305">Clearly, the NDP is in favour of modernizing the copyright rules. It is something that needs to be done, but there are too many major problems with this bill. In some cases, it even creates problems where there were none before. In my opinion this is not an approach that balances the rights of creators, who obviously must be paid for their work— their job is to create—and the right of consumers to have reasonable access to content.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861306">It is therefore our duty to vote against this bill, which contains far too many provisions that will have very serious consequences for the way in which Canadians obtain and share protected content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861307">The bill includes provisions that create powerful new anti-circumvention rights for content owners, which have absolutely nothing to do with the creators and content developers and prevent access to copyrighted works. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861308">These new provisions are supported by fines of $1 million. I think it is important to point this out because I do not understand how the average consumer could be fined such a large amount. It is completely inappropriate and unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861309">This measure is modelled directly after the United States' controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Digital locks would trump all other rights. I really do not see how this is useful for the consumers that the Conservatives claim to want to protect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861310">There are two fundamental problems with this approach. First, there is a real danger that it will prevent consumers from using content for which they have already paid, which is ironic given that the Conservatives claim to be working for consumers. The approach also seriously infringes on the rights of artists and creators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861311">The work of artists and creators is very important in our society. Indeed, it is very important for a society to have a lively arts and culture sector in order to reflect that culture on the world stage. These creators may no longer have the means to continue creating and will be forced to do other work. This is not going to benefit our country in the end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861312">We know that the government is accusing us of voting against a number of its bills, but we cannot not vote against this type of bill, which is harmful to consumers and artists alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861313">The NDP has fought every step of the way for a balanced approach to copyright. We participated in the committee, even without support from some of the opposition members, that studied this bill. We listened to the concerns of a number of groups with regard to the scope of this bill. At committee stage, we proposed 17 amendments that could have made this bill more balanced and fair for the artists and consumers. Nonetheless, the government did not listen to us or the many groups of artists and writers who came before the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861314">That is why it is impossible for us to support this bill, which penalizes Canadian families and artists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861315">I would be pleased to answer my colleagues' questions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2861325">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to speak today in support of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act. As many of my colleagues know, we are the closest we have ever been in the last 15 years to modernizing the Copyright Act. We are on the verge of having a Copyright Act that is responsive to the realities of both today and tomorrow, a Copyright Act that will give creators, innovators and ordinary citizens the confidence they need to take advantage of the opportunities of the digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861326">The fact is the Copyright Act in its current form is not responsive to many of the realities our digital world has brought forward. Our government is committed to fixing this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861327"> The last time the Copyright Act was substantially updated, VHS tapes, discmans and pagers were commonly used. For many, the flip phone was the trendy gadget of the day. Text messaging and mobile Internet were just beginning to be introduced on the market. In fact, dial-up modems were still quite common. That was only 15 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861328"> It would be a gross understatement to say that technology changed considerably since then. What was once considered cutting edge is now almost obsolete. In fact, it seems like something newer and better is popping up every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861329">Just the other day I was reading about all the speculation around what consumers could expect from upcoming versions of Smartphones. It is hard to predict what the high tech world will look like even 10 years from now. Digital technology has changed how Canadians access, use and share copyrighted content. Today, Canadians expect to be able to enjoy legitimately-acquired content where and when they want. Copyright laws need to respond to this reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861330"> Our government is committed to ensuring that Canada's copyright law is flexible and adaptable to change. We are also committed to ensuring that appropriate protections are provided for both creators and users. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would establish clear rules that would be flexible enough to allow the Copyright Act to evolve as technology continues to advance. It is balanced in that it provides new rights for creators, while providing new exceptions for users.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861331">Let me tell members about some of the exceptions in Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>. Bill C-11 would give Canadians the flexibility to record broadcast programming to enjoy at a more convenient time, often referred to as time shifting. It would also give individuals the freedom to copy music, films and other content onto any or all of the devices they owned, such as MP3 players and tablets, something that is often referred to as format shifting. Canadians would also be able to legally back up copyrighted material they purchased. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861332">Our government believes it is important that all Canadians, including those with disabilities, have access to copyrighted materials in a format they can easily use. That is why Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would allow Canadians with perceptual disabilities to adapt legally-acquired material to a format that would be more accessible. It would also clarify the law regarding the importation of adapted material into Canada and explicitly would allow the exportation of certain adapted materials, including Braille and audio books.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861333">As I mentioned, digital technology has fundamentally transformed the way many Canadians work, play and learn. For example, in the digital world, consumers are no longer passive audiences. Large segments of the population are interacting with content in new and innovative ways. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> recognizes this new reality by including new exceptions that respond to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861334"> Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> includes a user-generated content provision which would allow Canadians to incorporate existing copyrighted material in the creation of new non-commercial works. An example of this would be posting a home video on YouTube of a bride and groom dancing to their favourite wedding song. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861335">This exception recognizes that these new uses of creative content contribute to Canada's cultural sector. For example, these uses can enhance interest in the original when videos of user-generated content go viral on the Internet. This innovative form of creation can also shed light on emerging talent from across our country and showcase it to the rest of the world. Of course the digital age does not just offer opportunities for creation; it also offers many unique opportunities for learning and education.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861336">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> recognizes the immense opportunities that new and emerging technologies present for education. Digital technologies can enhance the traditional classroom experience and encourage new models for education outside the physical classroom. This can increase access to education and communities big and small across our great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861337">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> includes exceptions that would allow teachers and students to make better use of digital technologies and of copyrighted materials. For example, Bill C-11 would amend existing educational exceptions so that they are technologically neutral. No longer would we see references to specific technologies like flip charts and overhead projectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861338">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> also introduces a number of new measures that would enrich the educational experience. For instance, teachers would now be allowed to digitally deliver course materials to students. Students would be allowed to use material that they find on the Internet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861339">There are a number of other educational exceptions in Bill C-11 that I could describe, but all of these recognize the potential that the digital environment holds for teaching and learning in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861340">I have spoken about how Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> recognizes the opportunities that the digital environment offers for learning and creation in Canada. It is also important to note that Bill C-11 recognizes the potential this environment holds for creative and innovative businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861341">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> includes a number of provisions that would strengthen the ability of copyright owners to control the online use of their works. This would help promote innovative and legitimate business models and prevent widespread illicit use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861342">For example, Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> includes new protections for copyright owners who choose to use digital locks to protect their works. For a number of copyright owners, the use of digital locks can allow for the monetization of creative content and the protection of potentially significant investments made during the development phase. By providing protections against the circumvention of these locks, our government is supporting the ability of creators to advance new digital business models and compete on the international stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861343">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> also includes a number of provisions that would allow creators and innovators to compete in the digital age with confidence. This includes legal protections for rights management information and a new category of civil liability that targets those who enable online piracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861344">All of these measures would help attract new investments which would, in turn, promote economic growth and help protect and create jobs in Canada. In short, they would help position Canada as a leader in the digital economy of today and tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861345">It is clear that Canada's copyright laws need to be modernized to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the digital age. The bill we have before us would do just that. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> takes a balanced approach to copyright modernization. It considers the needs and interests of all Canada. Furthermore, it would bring our copyright law in line with international standards. It is very much in keeping with our government's commitment to promote innovation, productivity and job creation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861346">Of course, we cannot enjoy any of these benefits until we pass the bill. Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in giving these benefits to Canadians by passing Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861359">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak for a few moments to this important legislation. I will focus my intervention on a couple of points in the bill that I find quite troubling. I know my intervention must be focused on this bill and it will be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861360">I am particularly concerned with the way the government is prepared to move things through at a pace that is contrary to the rules of this House and that, frankly, fly in the face of the concerns that are brought to this House by members of Parliament on all sides as a result of discussions we have had with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861361">What we saw with Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> today was the government House leader introducing a time allocation motion, in other words, limiting debate once again. I believe it is the 23rd time that such closure motions or time allocation motions have been brought to this House in just a little more than a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861362"> There are not very many pieces of legislation that the government has been prepared to say to members of the House that they were elected by Canadian voters, just as the Conservative members were, and that it recognizes the role of Parliament and the rights of all members of the House, not just the government members, to represent their constituents and bring their concerns forward, and to use their own intellect, advice and experience to examine each piece of legislation within the confines of the general rules of practice and procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861363">Unfortunately, however, the government, and we are seeing it again with Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, does not believe in a parliamentary democracy but in something different. It believes in something that is almost leaning toward a dictatorship by the PMO. The PMO decides, and not the rules that govern procedure in the House, when there has been enough debate or discussion about a particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861364">The Conservative member who spoke previously listed off the number of witnesses who have been heard and the number of people who have intervened. When the government House leader introduced limitation on debate on Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> this morning, he talked about how many hours we have already talked about this. He said that a similar piece of legislation had been here in a previous Parliament and therefore we have already been there and done that so we should get it over with and just run it through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861365">What that ignores, of course, for the 23rd time that the government has brought in some restriction, imposed with its majority, on my right and the rights of my colleagues who have contrary positions to fully debate each and every stage of a bill. The government has said that it will decide whether a bill is good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861366">I have heard many members opposite in committee and in this chamber say that they think this is the way things should be done and that although we think the other way and are going to listen to experts who do not agree with them, frankly, it does not matter because they have the majority and they will have their way.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861367">The Conservatives very much begrudge our taking any time in this House to offer opinions which are in any way opposed to the government. We have seen how the government deals with opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861368">The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy had the audacity to offer positions based on evidence, facts and science, which are contrary to the PMO's vision of the world. Therefore, the body that did all that good work, all the evidence and science, the body that spent time and energy discussing important issues about the environment and the economy with Canadians will no longer be there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861369">Yesterday, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170380" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> said that the government, the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> and the Prime Minister's Office very much believe that they do not need expert panels, expert advice and scientists because they have the Internet and Google. They can get answers to their questions from Wikipedia. The beauty of that is if they do not agree with what is on Wikipedia, they will just change it. It does not have to be based on evidence or science; they will simply change it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861370">I find it extraordinarily distasteful. Frankly, it is creating bad policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861371">I have some experience in dealing with legislation and I know that if we do not take the time, do not consider alternative opinions, do not pore over the various provisions within legislation with a fine-tooth comb, inevitably there will be mistakes. We have seen examples of that already. The government has had to withdraw legislation because it was so bad. The Conservatives passed legislation in this House without entertaining any amendments or changes. They would not listen to any of our arguments or arguments in the other place which suggested that piece of legislation needed correction. As a result, the Conservatives ended up having to make changes afterwards, because they did not want to make changes here. They did not want to show this place any respect. They did not want to admit that they may have been wrong on something, that they may not have considered all sides of a particular argument. They therefore rammed the legislation through and then had to make changes afterwards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861372">My concern is that it was a most obvious and egregious weakness in that particular piece of legislation. With something like Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which is so technical and wide-reaching in terms of its implications, the government will ram it through without considering our amendments. We brought in 17 amendments at committee that were meant to establish a balance, but they were ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861373">The members opposite like to suggest there is no opposition out there and there is no other way. If I had the time, I would read into the record some testimony from a couple of experts, and there are many, but maybe in response to members' questions I will have the opportunity to mention some of the people who have problems with this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861374">I call on all members to take their time, recognize this is important legislation and give it the kind of scrutiny it deserves.</ParaText>

I was not a member of the committee, but I know that the members of the official opposition on committee worked very hard to improve this bill. As he mentioned, they put forward amendments. They are not the same as the amendments that I have put forward on which we are now debating, but they were similar in some aspects. They were certainly similar in trying to reduce the draconian way in which digital lock provisions are included in Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>

I went through the evidence from the fall and found that two of the largest music industry collectives of copyright said that they did not see any evidence of this from the U.S., where there are WIPO rules regarding digital locks, and Canada where we do not. In Canada, we are able to sell legally online, where people are using the online availability of music and not downloading illegally but are paying for their music. Canada's digital industry of online music was growing faster than the U.S. industry. They simply reject the idea that they are going to make more money or create more jobs in the music industry based on digital locks. I wonder if my hon. friend has a comment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861386">Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861387">To start, I would like to note my support for the bill. I encourage others to support it as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861388">The bill is a result of consulting, listening, and listening until we got it right. In fact, this legislation has come to this point through one of the largest consultations in Canadian history. By now, there should be no mistaking the message that we have received. Canada needs to pass legislation to update its Copyright Act and we should do so quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861389">As we have heard during various speeches delivered during the course of the proceedings on Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> and former Bill <Document DbId="4567265" Type="3">C-32</Document>, this legislation purposely balances both the rights of creators and the interests of consumers. It does so in a way that allows artists and creators to position themselves as they wish, but principally protects and enhances their ability to succeed as entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861390">By strengthening the protection of their intellectual property rights, we know that if we give our artists and creators, digital or otherwise, the proper legal and economic framework in which to produce work, a large number of them will succeed, prosper and grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861391">Canada is home to a great number of global success stories in the visual and performing arts, as well as artists and creators who use new media to tell their stories and create their work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861392">Every year, new artistic innovators emerge and build upon the successes of those before them. It is important that the laws which oversee the protection of their work are up to date and flexible, so that as art forms evolve and change, the law still applies in a way that makes sense, common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861393">On the other hand, without solid intellectual property protection, the kind of artistic activity that we celebrate every year at events like the Junos is discouraged, and success is more difficult to achieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861394">For instance, we should look at Canada's very successful video game sector. We all know that Canada is home to world leaders like EA Sports, a great company that makes games like Madden football and NHL, but there are a host of other companies that thrive here in Canada as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861395">For example, when the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> visited BitHeads here in Ottawa, the owner of that company told the Toronto <I> Star</I> afterwards that he loses 90% of his company's revenues to piracy activities. That is why he supports this new legislation. We need to ensure that this kind of piracy stops.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861396">I can also speak about the positive effect the bill would have on photography in Canada. The bill ensures that photographers are the first owners of copyright on their photographs, and that copyright will be protected for 50 years after the photographer's death. Taken together, what the bill aims to do is protect the incentive to create.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861397">Provisions in the bill strengthen the ability of copyright owners to control the uses of their online work, therefore preventing piracy and infringement and promoting new and legitimate online business models. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861398">For example, there are provisions creating a new category of civil liability which directly targets the enablers of online piracy. In the same light, the bill ensures the protection of technological protection measures, such as digital locks, to prevent unauthorized access to copyrighted material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861399">Artists and rights holders will not only benefit from these protections against circumvention, but they will also benefit from the creation of rules that prevent the manufacture, importation and sale of devices that can break digital locks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861400">The opposition has been critical of digital locks. The important point here is that digital locks are a tool in the box for creators who wish to protect their hard work. Rights holders are free to market their work with or without a digital lock. Fundamentally, they will respond to the market in which they are active in the way that best suits their interests and values. That is how it should be in a free market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861401">It is because of the measures I have just mentioned and more that I am happy to see the bill move forward, beyond the delay tactics we saw at second reading and through a productive committee session in the winter, to this stage today. In many respects this debate has given parliamentarians a strong appreciation for the economic contribution of artists and creators to the Canadian economy as people who innovate, create jobs and strengthen their communities as well as the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861402">We are also more aware of the opportunities that exist for Canadian artists in our new digital economy. Because of this appreciation and the promise created by these opportunities, what we are saying to artists across the country is that we understand this piece of legislation is important for their ability to profit fully from their work. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861403">We will bring the full force of the law against organized commercial piracy to protect the efforts of Canada's creative community. The commitment met with stakeholders' support again and again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861404">The Entertainment Software Association of Canada said that the government is delivering on a promise to modernize outdated law and support new and innovative business models. It considers that this legislation would provide a framework to allow creators and companies to distribute their works in the manner that best suits them. This is the association that supports video games and other entertainment software creators. It is saying clearly that this law should be passed now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861405">The Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network is just as clear. It said that it strongly supports the principles behind this legislation, and that piracy is a massive problem in Canada, which has an economic impact on government retailers and consumers. It said, “We are pleased the government is committed to getting tough on IP crimes.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861406">The Canadian Publisher's Council said that “...we all benefit from strong and precise copyright legislation that provides incentives to protect rights holders” in this highly competitive economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861407">It is clear that we have support to move ahead and that we are delivering with this legislation. With the kind of protection those stakeholders are seeking, it is clear that artists do not need things like an iPod tax, which the opposition supports again and again, and does so regardless of the market consequences and what it would mean for the ability of our creators to market their products in new and innovative ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861408">The opposition should take a more positive and confident view of artists and creators. In essence, it should see them as the innovative entrepreneurs that they are and support copyright modernization in Canada as a way of enhancing their ability to succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861409">This is our third attempt at introducing copyright legislation. Thanks to the efforts of our government, as well as those who took part in the Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> committee, we will finally bring Canada's copyright laws in line with international standards. This legislation would strengthen our ability to compete in the global, digital economy. It would protect and create jobs, promote innovation and attract new investment to Canada. Moreover, this legislation would encourage new ideas and protect the rights of Canadians whose research, development and artistic creativity strengthen our economy each and every day.</ParaText>

In fact, the first effort at amending copyright legislation goes back to 2005 under a previous Liberal government. Members on all sides of the House and all parties understand that Canada has signed on to international conventions relating to intellectual property and is amending domestic law to meet those terms. Steven Shrybman, counsel for the Council of Canadians, once said that if the governments of the world took climate change as seriously as they take intellectual property, we would have all our laws in place to reduce emissions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861428">The copyright modernization legislation was first introduced in June 2010 after extensive consultations that our government held across the country in 2009. During these consultations, we heard from thousands of Canadians. We listened and responded with a bill that would balance the interests of all Canadians. This includes Canadians who create and use copyrighted content. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861429">The bill was then extensively debated in the House in the previous Parliament. It was then studied by a legislative committee that heard from more than 70 witnesses and received more than 150 written submissions before that Parliament was dissolved. On September 29, 2011, our government reintroduced it. By reintroducing this bill without changes, our government demonstrated its support for a balanced approach to copyright modernization.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861430">We have since spent a great deal of time debating this bill in the House. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> was referred to a parliamentary committee that picked up the study where the previous committee had left off. We heard from additional witnesses. We received additional submissions. A clause-by-clause study was completed and some amendments were passed. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861431">This important piece of legislation is now before us, after this extensive review. We now need to deliver on our commitment to Canadians by passing Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> and modernizing the Copyright Act. Modernizing the Copyright Act would help protect and create jobs in Canada, which is the number one priority for this government.

              <ParaText id="2861432">One way that Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would do all this is by helping to ensure that hard work and good ideas are valued and rewarded in today's digital economy.

              <ParaText id="2861434">Let me relate the importance of some of these industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861435">Copyright matters to the film and television industries. In 2010-11, these industries represented $5.49 billion in economic activity and employed 128,000 Canadians. Where I reside, the North Shore of Vancouver, a tremendous number of people owe their livelihood to the TV and film industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861436">Copyright also matters to the video game industry. In 2011, this sector employed some 16,000 Canadians, including the Vancouver-based company Electronic Arts. The same sector is estimated to contribute $1.7 billion to the economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2861437">These industries are vital for our economy. I would also like to note that they contribute to the quality of life in communities across our great country.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2861438">Of course Canada's creative industries are not the only part of the economy that is affected by copyright. Copyright law affects a range of other sectors, one way or another. Some of these sectors include architecture, engineering, interior design, retail, telecommunications, information technology and educational institutions. Furthermore, copyright matters to Canadian citizens. This includes Canadians who make use of content, Canadians who purchase context and, of course, Canadians who create content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861439">It is clear that copyright law affects the lives of many Canadians and the work of many Canadian organizations. That is why we have taken a balanced approach to copyright modernization. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would balance the interests of all these parties. It would take a common sense approach by providing protections for the works of creators while, at the same time, recognizing the interests of users. This is good news for all Canadians, be they creators or users.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2861440">I would like to take the next few minutes to talk about the benefits of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> for Canadian creators. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2861441">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> promotes creativity and innovation by introducing new rights and protections for creators. It also provides creative businesses with a legal framework that will help them attract investment, engage in new business models and combat infringement in a digital environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861442">Let me relate a few of these measures that will be of interest to Canadian creators. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would implement the rights established in the Internet treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization. Let me relate a few of those rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861443">First, there is the distribution right. This right will allow a copyright holder to control the first distribution of copyrighted material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861444">Then there is the making available right, which all copyright owners, including performers and producers of sound recordings, will enjoy. This right allows them to control the release of copyrighted material on the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861445">Then there is the so-called moral rights for performers. These rights, similar to the moral rights already provided to authors, will give performers control over the integrity of their performance and its association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861446">By implementing all these rights, our government will bring Canada's copyright law in line with the widely recognized international standard of copyright protection for the digital age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861447">There are also a number of other measures of interest to Canadian creators in Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>. For example, the bill would make photographers the first owner of copyright associated with their photographs. This copyright would be protected for the life of the photographer plus 50 years. This would harmonize the treatment of photographers under Canada's copyright law with that of other creators. This would allow photographers to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861448">By modernizing the Copyright Act, our government will help protect and create jobs. Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would also help promote innovation and help attract new investment to Canada. It would give Canadian creators the tools they need to remain creative, innovative and to compete internationally. It would help all Canadians, be they creators or users, benefit from the opportunities of the digital age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861449">Let me stress that Canadians will not enjoy these benefits until Parliament passes the bill. Through consultations and committee hearings, we have heard the perspectives of thousands of Canadians. Through hours of debate, we have discussed the perspective they have presented. It is now time for us to pass the legislation and deliver on our commitment to Canadians to modernize Canada's copyright law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861454">The digital locks are an important tool for creators and copyright owners to protect their work. Software producers, video game and movie distributors, for example, continue to use digital locks as part of their business model because they wish to protect the significant investment each makes in developing the products. Canadian jobs depend on their ability to make a return on this investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861455">In other markets, however, in light of consumer demand, some businesses have chosen not to use those locks. Copyright owners may decide whether to use a digital lock and consumers can then decide whether to buy the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861456">The bill would also provide a regulation-making power to allow the circumvention of digital locks in certain cases, for example, where the presence of a digital lock unduly restricted competition in an aftermarket sector.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861466">We have proof that the plan is working. Statistics Canada recently announced that 58,200 net new jobs were created in April, with large gains in the private sector, manufacturing and in full-time positions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861469">I am proud to support a bill that both recognizes how technologies change the lives of Canadians and supports the industry and consumers. The bill would help Canadians better address the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital age. It would work in concert with other measures to strengthen our digital economy, including $80 million to accelerate digital adoption by small businesses, which was announced in budget 2011, and the significant funding toward innovation and venture capital in budget 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861470">We are also ensuring that Canadians have world-class digital infrastructure through actions like the auction of spectrum for next generation wireless networks and services.

              <ParaText id="2861478">The legislation would also bring our country in line with the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization Internet Treaties, including strong legal protections for digital locks, a new liability for those promoting infringement online and the making available right to ensure control of material over the Internet.

The person operating that site should face the full consequences of his or her activities. That is why one of the amendments adopted at the committee stage will facilitate targeting those who participate in violating rights of creators on a large scale: it is so that these types of violators can be punished. This bill will finally give more freedom to consumers while enforcing a hard line against organized piracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861480">A strong digital economy also requires a connected education sector.

              <ParaText id="2861481">As well, this bill includes a number of measures that will allow teachers and students to take advantage of digital technologies so that they can use copyrighted material on lessons conducted over the Internet. This will help the continued development of distance learning, which is opening up new educational opportunities for those in rural and remote communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861482"> These are just some of the measures in the bill that I fully support.</ParaText>

However, the question is relative to a digital lock, and if it is an intentional circumvention of the law for commercial purposes or for piracy, et cetera, then we have a situation that would definitely call for action by the authorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861499">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being allowed to rise for debate on Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861500">Since 2006, one of our government's goals has been to protect those who seek innovation by creating or evolving new ideas. We have answered the call sent by Canadians for responsible copyright legislation that would protect and help creators, performers and copyright owners or consumers. Our government recognizes how new technologies are changing the lives of many Canadians, and our creative industries deserve a modern understanding of the critical role copyright laws play in protecting and creating jobs in Canada's digital economy. In our fast-moving technological world, it is important that our legislation remain current and provide a better, more efficient way for copyright owners to create and protect their content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861501">After an attempt to modernize our copyright legislation in 2011, which we could not complete because of the demand from the opposition for an unnecessary election, I am proud to say that we continue to pursue this goal. We are glad that Canadians gave our government a strong majority so that the opposition can no longer disrupt our goal of providing creators with a modern copyright act that is in line with today's digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861502"> By reintroducing this bill without change in the fall, our government reiterated its support for a balanced approach to copyright reform, and after hearing more than 70 witnesses at the Bill <Document DbId="4567265" Type="3">C-32</Document> committee and almost as many at the Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> committee, we think that this bill will finally provide a new, modern and up-to-date vision for copyright that has always been shared by our government. Not only would this legislation bring our country on par with international standards; it would also make our country a world leader in terms of copyright reform. For example, I would cite the notice and notice provisions of this bill as truly innovative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861503"> I am also glad to say that multiple witnesses have provided strong support for this bill, acknowledging that our government's main goal is protecting and creating jobs while stimulating our economy and attracting new investment to Canada. As an example, the Canadian Publishers Council said that our government “...demonstrates a clear understanding of the need to amend the current Copyright Act to bring it more in line with our times”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861504"> In this regard, let me say a few words about the proposed amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, amendments that speak to the concerns that have been raised and that will bring some clarity and precision to the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861505"> For example, in response to the concerns from the CNIB, which provides support to blind and partially-sighted Canadians, we have introduced an amendment for non-profit organizations that limits the legal actions that can be taken against non-profits that mistakenly export abroad an alternate format that is meant for people with visual impairments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861506"> Some non-profit organizations had raised concerns with regard to the fact that they could be discouraged from making use of the exception regarding formats for people with a perceptual disability, because of the related legal liabilities. This clarification will enable these organizations to use the exception without fear of negative consequences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861507"> At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed their briefs and suggestions to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861508"> The intent of the bill is not to punish legitimate organizations that make an honest mistake in good faith, but to protect intellectual property as well as the rights of consumers. It should be noted that copyright holders can always ask for an injunction to bring an end to any violations. This amendment shows our good faith as well as our openness to proposed technical amendments. I would like to repeat that our intent is not to punish those who respect the law.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2861509">With this in mind, I would like to mention another amendment that would help to better target those persons who do not obey the law and who abuse the opportunities offered by the Internet. This amendment concerns safe harbour provisions. The amendment would clarify the scope of the legislation and eliminate safe harbours for persons who allow or enable copyright infringement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861510">Currently, service providers have four areas of exemption regarding enabling offences: caching services, hosting services, telecommunications services and information location tools, such as Google or Yahoo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861511">The amendment to the bill would eliminate safe harbours for caching and hosting in cases where copyright infringement would be enabled. Safe harbours are not created for criminals who seek to escape the law and abuse the legislation for their own profit. The amendment would clarify this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861512">The amendment would have a positive effect and give copyright holders other means of recourse to protect their works. They have the right to benefit from the results of their efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861513">We have also made an amendment concerning the scope of injunctions in order to clarify the legal issues surrounding search engines. This amendment would address concerns with search engines and possible catch-all injunctions that would be too broad to enforce, such as a court order requiring that a song be completely removed from the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861514">It is a matter of demonstrating common sense and having realistic expectations of what can be done to fight Internet piracy. Under the provisions of our bill, search engines would not be liable as a result of performing their role as neutral conduits.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2861515"> Once again, our goal is not to penalize legitimate intermediaries, such as search engines, that provide a valuable service to the users. That is highlighted by this amendment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861516"> This amendment goes hand-in-hand with our desire to recognize the neutral role played by these intermediaries in online activities. This bill is intended to establish a balance between the parties, and this amendment will help establish a reasonable balance for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861517"> For the consumers, we have made another clarification with the amendment concerning access to copies in terms of alternative formats and later viewing. This amendment confirms that personal use refers to the entire household, not just a single individual. We feel this is a matter of common sense. We hope that the bill reflects this common sense, both in its implementation and in its spirit. We must ensure that consumers can take advantage of the content they have purchased at the time and in the format of their choice, while respecting the balance between creators' rights and consumers' rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861518"> In addition, the wording of the former provisions could suggest that they granted a right to mass-distribute copies, provided they were intended for the recipient's exclusive personal use. This amendment reinforces the language of the act without changing its spirit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861519"> This amendment will also enhance intellectual property protection, while enabling consumers to enjoy their purchases in the comfort of their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861520"> Earlier I mentioned that this bill would make Canada a world leader in copyright reform. It is also important to note that we will finally be meeting the standards of the international treaties to which Canada is a signatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861521"> We have also added an amendment respecting international treaties to clarify the remedies available to copyright holders and to make it clear that they may base a remedy on the treaty of their choice, but not two at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861522"> The purpose of our bill is to provide Canada with a modern intellectual property regime adapted to new technologies. Treaties overlap when copyright is asserted or belongs to countries that are signatories to both treaties. This clarification protects consumers and means they will not have to pay twice for the same service as a result of overlapping international laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861523"> Once again, we have to do things properly and ensure that the rights of consumers and creators are respected and that our intellectual property regime creates wealth for the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861548">Many of us in the NDP know that our party has been at the forefront of r pushing for innovative and effective legislation through the work of colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> and others who have painstakingly committed to extensive consultations, both in the confines of Parliament and out across the country. They and are our team have reached out to all stakeholders, artists, academics, students, producers and all people in the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861549"> Our goal all along has been to produce the most innovative and effective copyright legislation we can. Unfortunately, the government seems to have issue with the concept of innovation, not just in this area but, frankly, all across the board. While it makes reference to wanting modern legislation, we know, and many stakeholders have indicated, that the legislation has gaping problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861550">What we have suggested is that we sit down and go through these gaps, that we close the gaps, that we solve the problems and that we retract the problems created as a result of the legislation, problems that were not there before. That is something we have been very consistently saying. We want to work at this and are continuing to work at this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861551"> We are very disappointed that the government pressed for closure of the debate, a habit that it has shown on many critical debates in this House. it is an action that limits not only the voices of Canadians in deciding their future on various issues, but makes for legislation that does not work, legislation that will cause greater problems, certainly in terms of copyright within the artistic community and the academic community. It might benefit some but most Canadians will face some real challenges as a result of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861552">We believe that copyright modernization is long overdue but this bill has too many glaring problems. In certain cases it even creates problems where none existed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861553">New Democrats believe that copyright laws in Canada can balance the right of creators to be compensated fairly for their work and the right of consumers to have reasonable access to copyright content. We have made it clear all along that the way we would consider possible amendments to the bill would be to create a fair royalty system for creators. However, as it stands, Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> wipes away millions of dollars in revenue for artists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861554">When we look closer at the issue, it appears that all Canadian attempts at copyright reform in recent years have had very little to do with creating a regime that would balance the rights of creators and the public, but rather have been an attempt to satisfy the demands of American large content owners, such as movie studios, music labels, video game developers and others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861555">What we are asking as New Democrats is: When will Canadians have copyright legislation that works for them? We believe that copyright laws in Canada can balance the right of creators to be compensated fairly for their work and the right of consumers to have reasonable access to content. The bill would grant s a range of new access privileges but would not increase opportunities for artists' remuneration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861556">This new playing field will profoundly affect the ability of artists to survive. The copyright modernization act essentially gives with one hand while it takes away with the other. While the bill contains a few concessions for consumers, they are, unfortunately, undermined by the government's refusal to compromise on the single most controversial copyright issue in this country, that being the digital lock provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861557">In the case of long distance education, for example, people in a remote, isolated community would have to burn their school notes after 30 days. That is hardly an improvement or an appropriate use of copyright law.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861558">People in remote communities across northern Manitoba depend on access to education and accessibility to materials. This is a clear necessity, as we New Democrats have said. The government claims to be on the side of training and education. However, the legislation would hinder that access, particularly for people who already face so many obstacles in accessing education and materials they need. The legislation would set them and our regions back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861559">We have proposed removing sections of the copyright modernization act that would make criminals out of everyday Canadians who would break digital locks for personal and non-commercial use. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861560">We do support the lessening of penalties for those who are responsible for breaking copyright law. This would prevent the excessive use of problematic lawsuits against ordinary citizens, like what we have seen in the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861561">The Conservatives unfortunately have ignored expert opinions raised in committee and the findings of their own copyright consultations in 2009. As a result, they have arrived at flawed legislation that may end up doing more harm than good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861562">New Democrats believe that copyright modernization is overdue, but this bill has too many glaring problems. We will be at the forefront of proposing positive changes and of being part of developing modernized copyright law that is in the best interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861563">I would also like to share the words of many respected people in their fields, people who know the legislation is flawed and that it will harm producers and users of so many materials that involve the copyright legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861564">Michael Geist, the renowned technology commentator, put it succinctly:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The foundational principle of the new bill remains that anytime a digital lock is used -- whether on books, movies, music, or electronic devices -- the lock trumps virtually all other rights...This...means that the existing fair dealing rights [and Bill C-11 rights]...all cease to function effectively so long as the rights holder places a digital lock on their content or device.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861566">The cultural industry has made a statement. It represents over 80 arts and culture organizations across Quebec and nationwide. It argues that the bill may be toxic to Canada's digital economy. It warns that failure to amend the copyright modernization act to ensure fair compensation for Canadian content owners can only lead to a decline in the production of Canadian content and its dissemination domestically and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861567">Instead of moving forward, instead of being at the cutting edge of innovation, instead of ensuring that our artists, researchers, academics and Canadian industries are able to be part of the future of the digital economy, the government's approach is setting us back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861568">Unfortunately this is an overall trend with the Conservative government, whether it is on the environment, economic development, education or in an area that I am involved with, women's rights. The government's approach is not to look forward, but rather to look at how we can pull away. In the case of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, when so many hours and so much effort has been made to shape the best legislation, the government has unfortunately not produced that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861569">Finally, I would like to share the message of so many of my colleagues in the NDP. The legislation would set artists back. Artists are the backbone of our country. They are the people who shape our communities, who tell our stories, who bring us together from coast to coast in a country as broad and as wealthy in talent as ours. The reality is we need real legislation that will allow artists to do their work and that allows Canadians to move forward. Unfortunately Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> is not that legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861570">We hope the government will listen to New Democrats and allow us to do that work.</ParaText>

A multi-step test for the courts to decide whether an author has been infringed upon is the way to go. The government would not even entertain it. That person has been written off as far as any concerns the author may have. This is not a way of listening to the people opposed to this. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2861589">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861590">The bill is returned to the House after extensive review by a legislative committee and the adoption of some technical amendments that will improve it but not alter the important policy balance that has been achieved. However, for those technical amendments, Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> is essentially the same as Bill <Document DbId="4567265" Type="3">C-32</Document>, which was being studied during the last Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861591">Members of the House might remember that Bill <Document DbId="4567265" Type="3">C-32</Document> went through 6 hours and 50 minutes of debate in the House, with a total of 17 speeches. In committee, 78 organizations and 122 different individuals appeared over the course of some 20 meetings, which lasted a total of 39 hours. That was a very comprehensive and wide-ranging debate on many of the same issues that have been reintroduced during the discussion around Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861592">The debate on the bill before us now has been even longer and we have heard from even more speakers, with 86 speeches in total as well as numerous interventions. Clearly the House has many views on copyright reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861593">The legislative committee also heard from a broad spectrum of interests that had a stake in the modernization of copyright. In February and March, the committee met on 11 occasions and heard from 62 individuals representing various creators, collectives, intermediaries, associations and businesses. They expressed varied and sometimes opposing views on a number of provisions in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861594">To emphasize the range of views that were represented, we heard from librarians and archivists, broadcasters, directors and film producers, musicians, publishers and authors, educators, lawyers and persons with perceptual disabilities. We also heard from large and small businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861595">I would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the concerns that we heard concerning copyright reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861596">The first relates to concerns we heard about compensation for creators. Some have argued for the expansion of the private copying regime and oppose the new exceptions for consumers. Expanding the private copying regime would increase the cost of new technologies. The government cannot have a strategy of greater access to the Internet and promotion of our digital economy and at the same time support a policy that would increase cost and taxes on new technologies that drive innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861597">The digital economy provides creators with new ways to market their works and find new revenue streams. The bill would provide them with new rights, protections and specific measures to combat the enablers of copyright infringement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861598">Another concern expressed by some stakeholders is that the fair dealing exception for education may have a detrimental impact on the revenue streams of creators. They propose that fair dealing be constrained rather than rely on the six factors that have been established by the courts to determine what is fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861599">I point out that fair dealing is not a blank cheque. It is a long-standing feature of our copyright law that permits individuals and businesses to make certain uses of copyrighted material in ways that do not unduly threaten the interests of copyright owners and which could have significant social benefits, but only if they are fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861600">Finally, in summarizing what we heard during the second reading debate and at committee, I point out that the education provisions of the bill received considerable attention and some criticized some of the safeguards that had been put in place to ensure a balance of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861601">The bill introduces new measures aimed at enriching the educational experience. It greatly expands the ability of teachers and students to make use of new digital technologies and of copyrighted materials in the educational context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861602"> For instance, teachers and students will be allowed to use copyrighted material in lessons conducted over the Internet and use legitimately posted material that they find on the Internet for educational purposes. The bill would also adjusts existing educational provisions to make them more technology neutral. The limitations and safeguards in place in relation to these new measures are an essential part of the balance between supporting learning and respecting the legitimate interests of copyright owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861603">These matters were discussed extensively at second reading and by the legislative committee, in which we enjoyed a very wide-ranging and thought provoking discussion. In addition to robust debate regarding the private copying regime, fair dealing and the specific education provisions, we heard about the need for technological neutrality and the benefits to consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861604">We are proud this bill would amend the Copyright Act to provide a technology neutral framework that would stand the test of time. We live in an ever-evolving media and technology landscape that requires such a framework moving forward, so we are getting rid of outdated references to flip charts and other technologies to ensure the legislation remains relevant.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861605">Finally, as followers of the copyright debate know, the bill proposes key changes that would benefit consumers. Consumers would have more flexibility to enjoy and manage their legitimately acquired content. Consumers would be allowed to time-shift their programming recorded on television, radio and Internet broadcasts. Consumers would also be allowed to format-shift and make backup copies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861606">Furthermore, we would be adding parody and satire to fair dealing and the ability for Canadians to create user-generated content. These are important amendments that would increase innovation and consumer choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861607">In committee, witnesses agreed with the central premise that has been made time and again in this House. Modernization of Canada's copyright laws is long overdue. Some argued that the balance we have established on the bill before us should be tilted one way; others argued we should go further in the other direction. That is the nature of a bill as complex as this one. Not everyone will get everything they were looking for in the modernized copyright regime. However, moving ahead with the bill will be much better than perpetuating laws that have not been updated in more than a decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861608">The bill would deliver a common-sense balance between the rights of consumers and the creative community. Importantly, it would also bring our laws in line with the WIPO Internet treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861609">Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document> would provide for a parliamentary review of the Copyright Act every five years. At that time, Parliament would have the opportunity to review the changes made by the bill, as well as study how well the Copyright Act, as a whole, is serving to balance the needs of creators and users.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861610">However, let us move quickly on passing the bill now, so that consumers and creators can soon benefit from these provisions. I urge hon. members of all parties to join me in voting for third reading so the bill can proceed to the Senate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861614">Mr. Speaker, of course there are significant education provisions contained in the bill, provisions that would make it easier for teachers to enhance the educational experience for students through a variety of means, technological means, for example, using the Internet to kind of learn on the fly and creatively explore things as they come up, as they are discussed by the class. Of course, this would be covered by the rules around fair dealing. There are six factors that have to be considered when we are talking about fair dealing. Witnesses, during the course of the committee hearings, from time to time forgot about the fact that those six factors existed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861615">We are also taking measures to better enable the use of distance learning so, for example, a student somewhere in a northern community, in Nunavut, could take part in a classroom discussion that is happening in a classroom in Edmonton, for example, and not be hindered by the rules around the copyright law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861627">One of my colleagues said it was the nth time, but it seems to me that this government is gagging us for the 21st time by limiting the time for debate. It is not just a question of the time available for study in committee, but also the time granted to the democratically elected representatives. They must be able to rise in this House and express their views on a bill without having a feeling that the gun is pointed at their heads and being told that they have to vote and pass this bill immediately.

              <ParaText id="2861926">Why are they so passionate about it? I am going to give you a few facts that can sometimes be a little surprising. We often say that the government opposite does not like arts and culture because they are not big business, like oil and gas; arts and culture are not as important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861927">The Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists, or ACTRA, estimates that the arts and culture industries in Canada contribute $85 billion a year to our economy. That represents 7.4% of Canada's gross national income and supports 1.1 million jobs, or about 6% of the Canadian labour force. These industries and the jobs that depend on them can survive only in an environment where intellectual property is protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861928">Despite the important contribution of these industries, the average income in 2009-10 for an artist in Canada was only $12,900 a year, which I find very sad. A 2008 report by the Conference Board of Canada indicated that the cultural sector generated approximately $25 billion. We are talking money and taxes. That is three times the $7.9 billion investment in culture by all levels of government in 2007. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861929">How much does the federal government invest in arts and culture? A meagre 1.6% of total government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861930">I was struck by another telling statistic in connection with this entire issue of copyright and the reform of copyright. In 2008, the Statistics Canada survey on household spending found that Canadians spent $1.4 billion on attending live artistic performances, twice as much as on sports events. And we know how much the government opposite likes to talk about sports and how little it talks about arts and culture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861931">What does such a change mean? When we look at the bill, it seems rather complicated. That is why I strongly disagree with the government's move to once again force the adoption of a time allocation motion. That forces us to shorten the debates and limit my colleagues' speaking time and right to speak here in this House. Most of my colleagues are here for the first time. It is highly likely that this is the first time in their lives they have heard about the Copyright Act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861940"> The NDP is looking to strike a balanced approach. Our party is seeking a balanced system between the rights of creators and those of the public. I hope that all the members of this House want to ensure that the public has access to as much information as possible while protecting copyright, which goes without saying.</ParaText>

I would have liked to discuss a great many things about this bill, which is riddled with shortcomings and defects. Amendments have been proposed, and it is my hope that they will be seriously considered so as to prevent foolish things from occurring. For example, students who are enrolled in distance education because they reside in remote areas would be forced to destroy their notes after a certain number of days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861944"> There are things in the bill that make absolutely no sense. I want to commend those people who work in the area of arts and culture. I particularly salute those people who work very hard for the City of Gatineau and the Maison de la culture de Gatineau, whose board I had the pleasure to chair for a number of years. They do extraordinary work when it comes to disseminating arts and culture. They help new artists, along with well-known artists, to make a name for themselves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861949">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from my colleague, who is also doing an absolutely phenomenal job in this area. He is an artist, a musician I very much like listening to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861950">The figures I cited earlier are absolutely incredible. It is often said that arts and culture are the poor cousins of the economy, but that is definitely not as a result of their impact in our communities. ACTRA estimated that the arts and culture industry in Canada injected $85 billion a year into our economy, which represents 7.4% of Canada's gross national income. That is not peanuts. People attend more shows than hockey games or anything else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861951">And yet it seems that artists and people who work in the cultural field are forced to spend their lives fighting for money, whether from the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> or from Quebec's Minister of Culture. I see that in Gatineau. It is a constant struggle, and artists always get the impression of having to beg, of being poor cousins. And yet they ultimately inject an enormous amount of money into the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861952"> There are activities and shows in the Outaouais, in Gatineau, among other places. Year after year, for example, L'Outaouais en fête fights for a minuscule grant from Canadian Heritage and is unable to get it. It seems that it is asked for much bigger guarantees than what big businesses are asked for—oil companies, banks or other businesses—on the grounds that it is part of the cultural sector. And yet it is an extraordinary economic organization. It is excellent for us. It represents us in Canada, in Quebec, among other places, where culture and the arts are flourishing so well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861956">In my speech, I talked about the $85 billion that is injected into Canada's economy. However, and this is shocking, by comparison, the average salary of Canadian artists is $12,900. That is terrible. It is below the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861957">When you look at a bill like this one through the eyes of an artist, of a person who works in the cultural sector, you may well wonder whether you will see any part of those billions of dollars.

              <ParaText id="2861960">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak to this bill. I am pleased that our government is getting closer to delivering on its commitment to modernize the Copyright Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861961">I would like to invite all of my colleagues to join me in ensuring the swift passage of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act. By supporting the legislation, we will be delivering on our government's commitment to modernize the Copyright Act in a way that balances the needs of creators and users.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861962">The road that has led us to where we are today has been a lengthy one. Once we pass the legislation, this will be the first time in more than 15 years that we have completed a comprehensive overhaul of the Copyright Act. During this time, we have heard from thousands of Canadians and have had ample time to debate copyright modernization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861963"> As my colleagues may recall, the copyright modernization act was first introduced following the largest consultations of their kind in Canadian history. In the summer of 2009, we set out to hear the views and opinions of Canadians from across the country. We leveraged new technologies to provide as many people as possible with access to this important process. We hosted interactive and web-based discussions. We held live events from coast to coast in Halifax, Quebec City, Montreal, Gatineau, Peterborough, Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. Finally, we also accepted written submissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861964">The response we received was impressive. Around 1,000 Canadians participated in the live events. More than 8,000 submissions were made, the website received 30,000 unique visits. We had more than 2,500 online forum posts and hundreds of followers on Twitter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861965">Based on this response, it was clear that Canadians from all walks of life understood the importance of modern copyright legislation, and this is still the case. During those consultations, Canadians told us about how copyright impacted their daily lives. Canadians told us about the importance of copyright to the digital economy and its effect on Canada's global competitiveness. Furthermore, Canadian creators and users told us that they needed clear, fair and predictable rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861966">Our government listened to all of this and we responded with the introduction of the copyright modernization act in 2010 and its reintroduction last fall. We have responded with legislation that takes a common sense, balanced approach to copyright modernization. This approach considers the needs of both creators and users of copyright material. We have responded with legislation that reflects a uniquely Canadian approach to copyright modernization, an approach that takes into account the perspectives that Canadians have shared with us as creators, consumers and citizens during our consultations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861967">I would like to highlight four specific things we heard during the consultations and highlight how our government responded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861968"> The first thing we heard was that Canadians thought that technological neutrality was an important guiding principle for copyright modernization. They emphasized that Canada's copyright regime must be able to accommodate technology that did not yet exist. They told us that any copyright reform must reflect the reality of an ever-evolving media and technological landscape. We responded. The copyright modernization act includes a number of exceptions that are technologically neutral. They reflect the reality of an ever-evolving media and technological landscape. They will stand the test of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861969">The second thing we heard was that Canadians wanted to make reasonable use of content that they had legally acquired. We responded. The copyright modernization act includes a number of exceptions that facilitate commonplace private uses of copyright materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861970"> The third thing we heard was that Canadians did not think it was fair that one could risk facing huge penalties for minor copyright infringement. We responded to this, too. The copyright modernization act would create two categories of infringement to which statutory damages could apply. The first category is commercial and the second category is non-commercial. For non-commercial infringement, the existing statutory damages in the Copyright Act will be significantly reduced. The copyright modernization act also introduces proportionality as a factor for the courts to consider when awarding damages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861971">The fourth thing we heard was that Canadian copyright owners wanted new rights and protections to sustain business models in a digital environment. We responded to this as well. The copyright modernization act would implement the rights and protections of the Internet treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization. These include a making available right, a distribution right, moral rights for performers and protections for digital locks and digital watermarks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2861972">These four things are just examples of what we heard during the 2009 consultations. There are numerous other things we heard and we responded to. Perhaps the easiest way to sum it all up is to say that the 2009 consultation demonstrated to us the importance of a balanced approach to copyright modernization, an approach that balances the interests of all Canadians, creators and users alike. This is the approach we will be delivering to Canadians by passing Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861973">Large scale national consultations have been held, legislation has twice been introduced and debated, witnesses have testified and submissions have been received. Committees have studied the bill at length and a number of technical amendments have been made to improve the clarity of certain provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861974">The bill is back before us. We need to pass the legislation and deliver results to Canadians. The fact is that after 15 years, it is time to turn the page on this chapter of copyright modernization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861975">Our government recognizes that new challenges may emerge in the future for the Copyright Act. That is why we have included in the bill a mandatory review of the legislation every five years. This five year review will ensure that Canada's copyright regime does not fall back into the outdated state it is today. However, before we can think about all this, we need to first modernize the Copyright Act by passing the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861976">Canadians from all walks of life have an interest in modern copyright laws. The benefits of copyright modernization are many. However, Canadians will not enjoy them until we have passed the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861977">I urge all members to join me in supporting the swift passage of the copyright modernization act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2861982">I will illustrate that. By having sat on the committee that studied the bill, we heard from a number of witnesses. It was very common to for witnesses to thank us for bringing in copyright legislation, but then they would say that there was one little thing we could change. We heard that from all sides of the spectrum. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2861983">At the end of day, the bill before us is one that is balanced, one that recognizes the needs of creators and also recognizes the needs of consumers.

              <ParaText id="2861984">It is a balance. We are in a new era. When this study first began, we knew that technologically we had advanced by leaps and bounds.

What happens if you take another course and are asked to use the concepts from the first course? What happens if you fail the course and have to take it again? This is really absurd and unfair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862004"> Here is another example of improvisation: the only protection measure that can be taken by content owners—who are often not the creators themselves—is to lock their works, which will really hurt consumers. Rights owners do not like it either, because it often benefits only the big companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862005"> This bill is also not good for consumers because digital locks make criminals of Canadian users who are entitled to access those works. The bill criminalizes the act of circumventing digital locks, regardless of the reasons for doing so, even for legal purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862006"> This bill ultimately gives consumers rights with one hand and, with the digital lock, takes them away with the other.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862008"> This bill creates an artificial and inconsistent legal distinction between "copying for private use" and "reproduction…for…private purposes".

              <ParaText id="2862010"> As in other matters, the Conservatives are self-styled experts, drawing inspiration from their retrograde ideology and, in this case, the controversial American legislation, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862011"> This bill creates legal uncertainty that will result in many costly court cases. In short, artists and creators, as well as consumers, archivists, teachers and students are opposed to this unbalanced bill. That is why, with the support of many stakeholders, the New Democrats, at committee stage, proposed 17 amendments that would have made it possible to have a more balanced bill that was fairer to artists and consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862012">In a nutshell, here are a few of those amendments: eliminate the loophole that the Conservatives included in the bill and that takes $21 million away from music creators; protect the moral rights of artists for new forms of content produced by users, such as mashups and YouTube videos; link the ban on circumventing digital locks to acts of violating copyright, thus allowing the circumvention of digital locks for legal purposes, which also involves ensuring that people with visual or hearing impairments have the explicit right to circumvent digital locks to gain access to a work; remove the "book-burning" provisions that the Conservatives are imposing on students and educational institutions by requiring them to destroy their educational material once the course is over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862013">These proposed amendments, which would balance this bill, were rejected by the Conservatives, despite the broad consensus of creators of culture in Quebec and in Canada. Instead of protecting creators by protecting their rights and ensuring that they will be paid for their work, instead of protecting Canadians and Quebeckers by giving them access to content, this bill aims to protect foreign interests. The Conservatives' priority is not to create a balanced system between the rights of creators and the rights of the public, but to respond to the demands of big U.S. content owners.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862017">I am going to wrap things up now because I have just one minute left. Copyright modernization is long past due, but this bill has too many major problems. Canada has an opportunity to become a leader by implementing copyright regulations and taking a balanced approach between the right of creators to be compensated fairly for their work and the right of consumers to have reasonable access to content. It is clear that the NDP is the only party that truly stands up for the rights of artists and consumers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862018">Madam Speaker, I listened to my colleague's speech with interest. It was concerning to me because the world is undergoing economic challenges and our government has been focused on job creation. In her province of Quebec the electronic gaming industry relies on digital locks in order for its business model to work. It is coming up with new models, guaranteed, but right now creators historically have been able to say that they own the intellectual property with their creations. Companies like EA in Montreal spend literally tens of thousands of hours creating a video game. That video game is locked. Companies sell the video game to consumers and the consumers know it is locked. That is their business model. They choose it. There is freedom for them to choose that model. What she and her party are proposing is that these locks should be able to broken. Today with the new technology, that means one person could buy that game, upload it on the Internet and this great company that employs literally thousands of Canadians could lose that intellectual property. It would cause extreme job losses, not only in her province but across Canada.</ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act, essentially would give with one hand and take away with the other from the consumers. That is what we are saying. This bill contains a few concessions to consumers but they are then undermined by controversial issues like digital lock provisions. That is what is going to be undermining all sectors of the creation economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862021">What my colleague does not seem to understand about our position is that we are talking about a more balanced approach. The digital lock provision is a sweeping legislation in favour of the companies and not there for the creators or for the consumers. This is really, in most cases, going to be in favour of the companies that are not usually based in Canada. So there needs to be a lot more battling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862028">Madam Speaker, it is so wonderful to see such agreement on the other side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862029">I am pleased to rise in my place to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization bill. This legislation is a result of an extensive amount of consultation and debate. I believe that we have arrived at a good bill that is ready to be passed by this House. While the process to get here has been long, we have seen the support of representatives from across Canada's creative industries, like software producers, as well as consumer groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862030">The name of this bill says it all. This is a bill to modernize Canada's copyright regime. Why do we need to modernize Canada's copyright law? Because it was last updated in the late '90s. Let us consider that for a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862031">In the era of SMART Boards and e-learning, the current Copyright Act is weighted down by provisions that apply to overhead projectors and dry erase boards. This says nothing about how consumers' lives have changed since the advent of smart phones and PVRs. This law is simply out of touch with our daily lives. We live in a global digital environment yet have copyright laws that were last updated in the 1990s, before the dot-com era, before social media, and before tablet computers and mobile devices allowed us to access thousands of songs, movies and gaming applications at the touch of a button or at the swipe of a finger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862032">We went from 8-bit video game consoles to motion sensing input devices that can use gestures and spoken commands instead of hand-held controllers. Video game consoles can be found now in households all over Canada and they have many times the processing power of computers from the '90s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862033">Our government's approach to copyright is clear. We want Canada to have a modern, forward-looking, technologically neutral copyright regime that balances the rights of creators and rights holders with the everyday activities of Canadians in the 21st century economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862034">One of the motivating principles behind our government's approach to protecting intellectual property is to promote and spur innovation in Canada. Our government knows the important role that innovation plays in creating economic growth and jobs now and in the future. That is why, as part of our jobs, growth and long-term prosperity bill, we have proposed considerable investments in programs that support business-led innovation and research and development. All of this would be for nothing if those innovators, entrepreneurs and creators did not have the legal tools available to them to protect their works. A modern copyright regime is one of those tools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862035">Following the legislative committee's review of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the committee proposed a targeted set of technological amendments to the bill to ensure that the spirit of the legislation is implemented. It is for this reason that the committee adopted specific technical amendments to support innovative companies in the information technology sector. I commend the committee for its work and fully support the amendments it has proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862036">Allow me to explain. The amendments to the bill's exception for reverse engineering, interoperability and security testing will serve their purpose in encouraging these economic activities while not exposing other businesses to needless risks. When conducted in good faith, these kinds of activities are a necessary step in the process of developing new computer applications or computer security tools, thus driving innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862037">However, we cannot ignore the possibility that some individuals would pursue such activities for malicious reasons. To ensure that this does not happen, the bill has been amended to firmly establish that these exceptions should never apply to an activity that is otherwise in violation of the Criminal Code of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862038">Furthermore, the committee proposed an amendment that seeks to clarify the section of the bill that brings many of those everyday activities that Canadians are already doing, namely time and format shifting, onto the right side of the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862039">The amendments recognize that creators' and rights holders' interests could have been unduly compromised by an ambiguity in the original version of the clause, which did not specify that these exceptions are meant only for the private purposes of the person who made the copy, not for somebody else's private purposes. This change, while seemingly minor, made sure that the adequate protections remain in place for the legitimate interests of rights holders and creators. It also gives consumers the clarity they need to understand what is allowed and what is not allowed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862040">Finally, all of us in this House know the incredible growth potential that is still to be realized in the digital economy. Year over year, e-commerce continues to grow even despite broader uncertainty in the world economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862041">Dematerialization of video games, for instance, is only one of the new phenomena produced by the progress of the digital economy. This part of the Canadian economy is a hotbed for innovation and the creation of new technologies, like cloud computing. Our government is completely committed to supporting the digital economy and our record to date reflects this amazing commitment. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862042">That is the big reason why we have included elements in the bill that strike directly at those who undermine legitimate online businesses by enabling the large scale infringement of copyright. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862043">illegitimate online services like these drag down the economic potential and opportunity of the mainstream digital economy. The piracy they enable makes creators and rights holders think twice about engaging in this new and emerging market. This is bad for creators and bad for consumers. Jason Kee, from the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, said in committee that we are talking about an industry that employs approximately 16,000 people in good quality jobs. He pointed out that it accounts for an estimated 11,000 more in terms of indirect employment, and contributes $1.7 billion in direct economic activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862044">That is one reason why we need this bill. It give creators and copyright owners the tools they need to specifically target these piracy enabling services. This is where the committee identified the need to tighten up this clause in order to ensure that the services that enable the violation of copyright are rightly identified and exposed to the appropriate level of liability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862045">I believe that the amendments that I have described today make it absolutely clear, the government does not tolerate piracy. This bill would make it much more difficult for commercial pirates to get away with infringement. Everyone in the House should welcome these technical amendments. They are the product of an extensive committee review process that stretched over two Parliaments and which met for 21 combined days of deliberation, hearing the testimony of 110 witnesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862046">For creative industries, like software creators and video game publishers, the bill provides a clear, predictable, legal framework that allows them to combat online piracy and roll out new online business models. Businesses that decide to use technological protection measures to protect their products should have the protection of the law. We will provide legal protection for businesses that choose to use technological protection measures, or digital locks, to protect their work as part of their business models. At the same time, the bill also ensures that locks on wireless devices will not prevent Canadians from switching their wireless service providers, as long as existing contracts are respected. This will not affect any obligations under existing contracts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862047">This highlights our commitment to produce a bill that will be balanced. It is, above all, common sense. In closing, I think it is important to note the mandatory five year review that has been put right into the bill. This will mean that whatever issues may arise we will have the benefit of a review to see how the bill can be improved in the future. This step is important because we know that technology evolves, understanding of copyright evolves and new issues emerge. Parliament will have the ability to react in a thoughtful fashion to these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862048">I urge hon. members to join me in supporting this committee report and to work with the government to move the bill to the Senate. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862050">It makes me think that, even though the government tells us that enough time has been spent on this bill, not enough time really has been, when you consider the kind of opposition it has raised. For instance, the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, SOCAN, believes that amendments should be made to the bill to facilitate access to creative content on new media, and especially to ensure that creators are fairly compensated for their creative content on new media. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862051">Once again, it is a question of balance.

There is the whole issue of the creators, the authors, that is at stake in this change, which is quite extensive, thank you, and which seems to create more problems than it solves. </ParaText>

It is like if my colleague had a store of suits and decided that he would lock the store when there was nobody around. He could choose to lock it or unlock it but if he unlocked the store perhaps people would come into his store and take all of his suits. With that business model, unfortunately, he would go bankrupt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862063">There are creators who require that their products be sold with digital locks. The consumer can decide to buy it or not to buy it. That is what it is about. Unfortunately, we have tried to answer my colleague's questions over and over again but he still does not get it and I am sure he will ask it again.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862064">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be joining the debate on Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, is a bill that I have worked on for some time. In fact, previous to this Parliament, I was parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, a position I quite enjoyed. I had the opportunity to work hand in hand with the minister and the Minister of Industry in the crafting of this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862065">This bill was undertaken with more consultation than any bill in history to the best of my knowledge. We had consultations in Canadian cities right across the country. In fact, there was even a consultation held in Peterborough, largely with members from outside of Peterborough, but folks from Peterborough were there as well. We had the opportunity to view some 8,000 online submissions for the bill as well. We undertook extensive consultations in consideration of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862066">One of the comments by a witness who appeared before the committee that stands out for me was from the president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, the hon. Perrin Beatty. As members know, the Chamber of Commerce has been calling on governments for more than a decade to update Canada's copyright laws and his quote really stood out for me. Perrin Beatty said to the committee,“Why throw out the good in pursuit of the perfect?”. That is what the opposition members would like. They would like a good bill thrown out because they know in their hearts there is no such thing as a perfect copyright bill. It does not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862067">Copyright law is about balance. It is about a balance between those who wish to purchase items and those who have created items. That is a relationship that will forever be changing and redefined. However, we establish the laws and boundaries that should dictate that relationship and we try to do so in a manner that is balanced and fair to all concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862068"> However, that does not mean that all concerned will agree with every aspect of the bill but it does mean that we are striving to maintain a balance that respects everyone involved. That is what the government has worked to do. I am proud to say that the government is moving ahead with copyright modernization that addresses the challenges and opportunities of the Internet and other digital technologies and will bring Canada's copyright laws up to international standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862069">We have a copyright law right now. We signed onto international treaties in 1997. The Liberal Party was in government then. I am sure members remember those dark days when the Liberal Party was in power and it would sign international treaties with no intention of actually fulfilling them. Well, it did that with the Copyright Act as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862070"> I hear a member of the NDP shouting across the aisle. I am going talk to the NDP House leader because he has spoken against that kind of action in this House and I commend him for his constant lobbying and efforts to bring a new level of decorum to this House. I will just make him aware that one of his members is not holding up to his own very high standards. I am sure we will get that looked after.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862071">When it comes to our international obligations, we have taken them seriously. We want Canada to be inside the tent. We want to be with those nations that have stood up for copyright holders, creators and industries. We want to create those jobs. This bill is as much about economic stimulus as it is about anything else. It is as much about job creation as it is about protecting copyrighted materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862072">With respect to the question from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, I have been watching the debate on television and I have heard the question a number of times, not just from that member but from other members of his party and others. It has a very simple answer. When people purchase something, they purchase it for a specific purpose. The member keeps on talking about a CD and about format shifting something that is not permitted. Although one does not buy a legal right to format shift it, the member is making the argument that one should be allowed to format shift that piece of copyrighted material even though one did not pay for that right. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862073">My colleague just used the example of a clothing store owner. It is like going to a clothing store, buying a pair socks and then going back and saying, “By the way, I have decided it was not socks that I needed. What I really wanted was shoes, so I am just going to take these, I am going to format shift from socks to shoes and I am not going to pay anything because it was all for my feet”. That is the argument that we are hearing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862074">Time and time again, we heard from professional witnesses who came in and extolled the virtues of this bill. Did we hear from others who had other opinions? Yes, we did. The NDP members had lots of support for what we called an iPod tax and they called a levy. They had lots of support for placing additional charges on consumer electronic devices. Of course the debate was not honest at the outset. They were saying that it would just be for MP3 players and that it would be a nominal fee even though they applied to the Copyright Board to charge a fee of up to $75 per device. At committee I told them that the technology had already passed them by with respect to those devices. I said that they were antiquated technologies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862075">On the new technologies, things like smart phones and car stereos, the NDP members initially scoffed and asked why they would want to put anything on car stereos. Well, I have a car outside that has 60 gigabytes of memory in it. It can actually store movies and music. However, I would never store music and movies while I am driving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862076"> I oppose any kind of fee. The other problem with what the NDP members were proposing is that they were proposing a fee on devices like mine, a BlackBerry proudly made in Canada, great Canadian technology, but it would only go to one single medium, music. It would not go to photographers, or film creators or artists. It would only go to music. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862077">This device that is capable of communication, emails, photos, movies, any kind of online activity as far as viewing and receiving information and may also be able to store music, but what the NDP members are proposing is a levy on that device just for music, that would only go to musicians, and consumers would have to pay even though they have already purchased the materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862078">If I am buying a licence from, for example, iTunes and, with that, I receive a licence to make five additional copies, and this may also answer some of the questions that we have heard, I am buying an agreement that I can put that song on a device but also on up to four more devices. When people buy a licence from iTunes they are able to format shift that and store that on multiple devices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862079">The NDP and some of the other proponents made a proposal, which the Liberal Party was very strong on, as was former member, Pablo Rodriguez, and it was something that we voted against because we disagreed with it. Their proposal was to increase the price on devices and we disagreed on that. There were other areas where we did agree but this clearly was an area where we disagreed. That is why the hon. Perrin Beatty, who I referenced earlier, said that it would be silly to throw out a really good bill because we disagree with a certain aspect of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862080"> In the meantime, billions of dollars are being siphoned away from creators in this country, from the creative economy. Wealth destroyers, companies whose business it is to literally destroy the wealth of industries, are operating in this country illegally, pushing out pirated copies of music and movies and other things. This bill provides the tools needed to crack down on the wealth-destroying operations in this country. It is high time that we did it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862081">Graham Henderson of Music Canada came before our committee and gave a fantastic presentation. It was unfortunate that we had a procedural vote at the time but he spoke emphatically in support of this bill. The entertainment software industry emphatically supported this bill. The film industry said that a billion dollars a year were going missing that should be invested in jobs, movies, new creations and new products that Canada can be so proud of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862082">We need this bill, which is why I am proud to stand behind it and vote in favour of it tonight. It is time to end 15 years of debate on copyright legislation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862100">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>. As we discuss this bill and listen to the different speakers, I get the sense that we are doing so strictly from the perspective of intellectual property as we knew it 20 or 25 years ago. In other words, there is a gap, and we have to find a legal way of plugging that gap. That is the sum of it. Having said that, this is a new age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862101">The digital age is in the process of completely redefining the way we see things, our relationship with others, and the way we buy and consume products. When we consider copyright, we must do so through this new lens. Otherwise, we will quite simply be left behind. It would be as if we were trying to apply old ways of doing things to a new world. And if we move in that direction, we are sure to fail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862102">Of course, on the other side of the House, the Conservatives will say that copying is wrong. Of course, copyright must be respected. However, the most important thing with this bill is to strike a real balance. We frequently talk about artists and consumers, but we often forget that there is somebody between the two called a distributor. This intermediary is often forgotten. In certain cases, it is even companies whose business it is to buy copyright and to market it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862103"> We often talk about protecting artists and ensuring they have an income, which is very noble, I might add. We also talk about the rights of consumers, but we forget that the company that is trying to protect the products’ distribution is the real beneficiary when it comes to this legislation. Very little is said about the distributor. Clearly these companies are losing a lot of money. Obviously, when copying is involved, money is lost. However, that does not necessarily mean that each copy would have meant a purchase in the real world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862104"> Nevertheless, everybody needs to be compensated appropriately. And on that point, I come back to the artists, who, with this bill, will lose tens of millions of dollars in compensation. I am not thinking of the richest artists, but certainly of the artists who are the least well off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862105"> It is important to look at this in a global context, especially from a legal point of view, because what we are doing right now is laying one of the first stones in the legislative framework of the digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862106"> The compact disc industry is facing its demise. Why? Because, even though the medium was not very expensive, distributors tried to sell CDs for the same price, if not more, than a technology that was more expensive to produce. The upshot was that as soon as there was a less expensive alternative, copying became par for the course. Little by little, revenues dropped, and despite everything, new business models emerged. The success of iTunes attests to this very fact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862107">Companies that distributed the works were strongly opposed to the development of that kind of new model. It can definitely be hard to adapt to that kind of change, but adaptation is good. We cannot expect to do exactly the same thing with digital technology that we are doing now or have done in past decades. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862108">Digital locks are one of the thorniest issues in this proposed legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862109">This is not about the rights of creators or consumers. It is about the rights of those who distribute works of all kinds. It seems to me that locks are a bit heavy-handed if the goal is to protect copyright. What this bill protects is distribution rights, not copyright. I would have liked to see a better balance between copyright, distribution rights and consumer rights. That is why the NDP suggests greater flexibility with respect to locks in cases of material for personal use, and only then. We have to be specific about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862110">As I pointed out in my question a few minutes ago, people do not go to a record store to buy a CD, just as they did not buy LPs or cassettes back in the day. What they are buying is music.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862111">It is all well and fine to say that there is licence upon purchase, but what does the consumer understand by that? What are people saying about this licence? Go ask people on the street whether they are buying the right to take a CD and put it in the player. They would never say that. However, they will say that what they are buying is the right to listen to an excellent album wherever they want, whenever they want. They will tell you that every time, but they will never say they are buying just the CD.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862112">That is why I think that in a way, the government is going a bit too far when it comes to these locks. What will more restrictive locks accomplish? I fear they will prevent creation. Indeed, people will be turned off and will not want to buy works that are expensive and difficult to access and that they have to pay for three, four or five times in order to be able to listen to them as they please, in other words, at home, at the cottage, in their car and so on. Where will this take us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862113">Some might say that I am exaggerating, but I am not too far off the mark. The important thing is to restore balance between access, use and distribution. That is the core message I want people to take away from my speech. I believe that we must respect international treaties, but are we respecting international treaties or the needs of certain international distribution companies?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862114">In my opinion, we first need to restore the balance that should exist in an ecosystem. First of all, we do not live in a market, but rather in a society. People have aspirations. Students in particular come to mind. It is absurd to say that course notes should disappear a few days after the course ends. It makes no sense. Personally, I keep everything and I still have my course notes from when I was in university. Those notes would have disappeared a long time ago in the digital world under the bill currently before us. However, it can sometimes be useful to reuse these notes and have all this information close at hand, depending on the subject, of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862115">There is something wrong here. The government says that many meetings were held and that the bill is the product of extensive consultation. The committee heard from many people in several parliaments. The government repeats this ad nauseam. Consultation is all well and good, but I have to wonder if the government listened.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862116">Fundamentally, the question we need to ask is whether the government really listened. It can hear something, but if it does not listen and does not want to do what people say, it is destined to draft legislation that is more flawed than it should be. We will never create perfect legislation; we all know that. But we can always make it better. We had plenty of time, and many people gave their opinions on this. So why not adjust it for everyone's benefit, rather than for the benefit of just a few?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862117">We currently have all the information needed to ensure that this cornerstone of the digital world is well made, well placed and stable. It is especially important to listen to what people have to say. That will result in better legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862121">The bottom line is that we want everyone to be satisfied with this legislation. We want creators to get their fair share. That means that they must be properly compensated for the work they do. We obviously want distributors to be compensated for their work, and we also want consumers to have access to works at a reasonable cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862122">Naturally, if we cannot satisfy everyone, it will lead to an imbalance in the legislation. In my opinion, this imbalance will reduce creators' economic and commercial interest in producing. They will instead find a job as a taxi driver, for example, as was recently suggested. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862124">During his speech, particularly at the end, he began talking about the government listening. Did the government listen to us? Did it listen to the people and the experts? I see that, in the House, the majority of the young people, who were born into technology, are on our side, both as members and as assistants. So we have a lot of experts with us and we recommend them. It is a different angle that I wanted to bring. The youth know a lot about this issue, and perhaps we should listen a little more to them.</ParaText>

This is the youngest Parliament in history. As we build this digital society—because that is really what we are doing with technologies and the Internet—young people deserve not just their place, but a prominent place in the study of this type of issue, as my colleague said.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862128">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege and honour to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization bill. This bill was designed to address the interests of Canadians, from those who create content to the consumers who benefit from it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862129">I am also glad to see how the efforts of parliamentarians on all sides have moved the bill forward and have earned the support of Canada's creative community. Parliamentarians heard from many who contributed to the committee process through testimony and submissions. We heard a clear message that copyright laws play a critical role in protecting and creating jobs in Canada's digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862130">We all know that a strong copyright regime is critical for the growth of our digital economy and our information and communications technology sector. Combined with other legislative initiatives, as well as innovative measures by the private sector, this bill will contribute to a well-functioning digital economy by instilling trust and confidence in consumers and creators. I cannot reinforce enough the fact that we need to instill trust and confidence in consumers and creators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862131">One of the key pieces to a strong digital economy is the safeguarding of intellectual property. This legislation will provide these safeguards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862132">A myriad of witnesses testified over the last couple of years through a few iterations of this legislation. I am glad to say that the following associations have shown support for aspects of the current bill: the Canadian Council of Chief Executives; the Canadian Chamber of Commerce; the Canadian Photographers Coalition; the Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network; the Canadian Council of Music Industry Associations; the Entertainment Software Association of Canada; the Canadian Independent Music Association; Association des producteurs de films et de télévision du Québec; and many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862133">I would like to take some time now to discuss other important aspects of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862134">The bill introduces a new remedy for copyright owners against those who knowingly enable infringement of copyright. This new remedy supplements existing criminal powers to deal with pirate sites by adding stronger tools for copyright owners and makes liability for enabling of infringement clear. I think it is important to bring clarity to this matter and that is what the legislation sets out to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862135">We are making sure to protect copyright holders in order to give them the ability to defend themselves. Canada's creative industries will also benefit from an amendment made at the committee stage that clarifies statutory damages for copyright infringement. Copyright owners will finally have stronger legal tools to pursue online pirate sites that facilitate copyright infringement. The amendment will facilitate targeting those who participate in wide-scale violation of the rights of creators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862136">Another amendment will also eliminate the safe harbour for those who infringe author's rights. Canadian creators, performers and artists will benefit from the rights and protections that are part of the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO, Internet treaties, including the exclusive right to control how their copyrighted material is made available on the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862137">Consumers will benefit from this bill as well. It legitimizes activities that Canadians do every day, such as downloading music and certain kinds of format shifting, such as when people use PVRs to record shows and watch them later. Canadians will finally be able to record television, radio and Internet programming in order to enjoy it at a later time with no restrictions as to the device or media they wish to use. Once again, the legislation is providing clarity and certainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862138">The big issue is that this legislation speaks to the balance we have achieved. It is fair and it is balanced. Canadian consumers will also be able to copy legitimately acquired music, film or other works onto any device or medium, such as MP3 players, for their private use. They will also be able to make backup copies of these works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862139">Those are just a few examples of the common-sense changes within this bill. That is one reason I am so supportive of this legislation. Those examples show why this bill is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862140">Right away we can see that the bill is technologically neutral. We were told time and time again by stakeholders across the spectrum that we need legislation that is not rendered obsolete by new advancements in technology, as the current act is. There have been three different attempts over the last 15 years, since 1997, to bring the legislation into the 21st century. This is what we are about to do with this legislation moving forward. The fact is technology is advancing all the time. It will be something that we will be addressing as we move forward as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862141">Canadians with perceptual disabilities will be permitted to adapt legally acquired material to a format they can easily use. We have heard time and time again about the difficulty perceptually impaired Canadians have accessing works in Braille or in a format they can enjoy more fully. I am proud that we have taken the step in this legislation to allow for some conversion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862142"> Our government also understands the difference between a large-scale violator and an ordinary consumer. The legislation introduces the concept of proportionality in statutory damages. It revises current provisions for statutory damages to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial infringement. That is very important. This bill reduces an individual's potential liability in cases of non-commercial infringement to a one-time payment of between $100 and $5,000 for all infringements that took place prior to any lawsuit being launched. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862143">It is through these types of measures that we will finally provide real protection for the intellectual property created by Canada's creative industries. It is through these and other steps we can see the meticulous balance that has emerged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862144"> Even better, the bill also includes a statutory five-year review. As I mentioned, technology is advancing all the time, and it is important that we continue to review this legislation and have a proviso in the legislation so if that balance is upset at any time, or if an unforeseen consequence of the legislation occurs, changes can be made to improve the act in the future. We know that perfection in copyright legislation is elusive, so having the opportunity to make changes just makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862145">In closing, I want to take some time to connect this bill to other steps our government has taken to promote and create innovation in our economy. I represent the constituents of Kelowna—Lake Country, an innovative, technologically sound and vibrant community. We are encouraging the private sector to create and adopt new digital technologies. We are developing tomorrow's digital workforce. For example, in budget 2012, acting on the Jenkins report, we announced $1.1 billion to directly support research and development; $500 million for venture capital, something we have heard a lot about the need for; $37 million annually for Canada's granting councils; $10 million for the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; $500 million for the Canada Foundation for Innovation; and much more. Members can see this funding helps to provide the basis of a strong, connected digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862146">I would encourage the opposition to join us in putting Canada's economy and Canadian jobs first. This bill is on the right track to do just that. It is time to get it passed.</ParaText>

One in five jobs in Canada and 60% of our GDP are based on trade. We continue to expand our trading opportunities. One of the ways to do that is to ensure that Canadian creators have the certainty and protection that this balanced legislation provides. As my colleague just alluded to, we attended a workshop session on intellectual property and CETA, looking at the agreement with the European Union.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862150"> That is why it is so important, as I mentioned in my speech, to have the five-year review of the legislation. Situations could be brought forward. Technology is changing all the time. We want to ensure that we have the right legislation to meet the needs of Canadians from coast to coast to coast today. As I mentioned, this is the third attempt since 1997 to try to bring this legislation into the 21st century. I am very confident the legislation balances the rights of creators and the interests of consumers today and for the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862173">Madam Speaker, for the past hour, I have been listening to the hon. members opposite talk about the industry's needs. If they were more transparent—honest might be a better word—they would clarify the fact that when they say industry, they mean the very large distributors. I have a great deal of respect for large distributors, which are a major part of the world economy, but they are talking about helping companies like Sony and Walt Disney. Those are the corporations that will benefit from this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862174">Let me go back to a rather striking example. How can they claim that they are thinking about the industry, when the cultural industry—which includes 80 arts and culture organizations across Quebec and the rest of the country, so from all across Canada—has stated that the bill will be toxic to Canada's digital economy? How can there be 80 major organizations across the country that have come to that conclusion and yet the government is still constantly claiming that it is thinking about the industry?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862175">Certainly some sectors of the industry are perfectly comfortable with this bill, but let me reiterate that major sectors have reached that very harsh conclusion. That does not come from the New Democrats, but rather from a significant portion of the cultural industry, not just distributors. This bill will be toxic to Canada's digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862176">Those organizations have warned us that if the government fails to amend the copyright modernization bill to ensure that content owners are properly compensated, this will lead to a decline in the production of Canadian content and its dissemination domestically and abroad. We are using the word “dissemination”. These are crisis words, blunt words that, I repeat, are not coming from the “big bad leftists”, as some of our neighbours opposite like to call us, but from people in the cultural industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862177">With this kind of reaction from such important industry players, the government should first have the decency to not claim any great success. It should show great respect for the industry's response to the bill and go back to the drawing board until these people believe that the government's proposed legislation will not give rise to something as significant as disseminating Canadian content in Canada and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862178">In Canada, the government has historically had a hard time fully understanding the cultural industry and its front-line players: creators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862179">I cannot cover every aspect of this 70-page bill, but I will take a few minutes to talk about one aspect I know well and to provide some historical overview.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862180">We have been lagging behind for far too long with respect to the status of creators in Canada. We are one of the last countries to keep its Copyright Act under the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food. We are one of the last countries to realize that it has been a very long time since the days when artists were reduced to simply performing at agricultural fairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862181"> Then the government came up with a modernized copyright regime that was one of the worst in the western world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862182"> Let us compare our copyright system with what was being done in Europe in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Here, for example, a songwriter or composer—and this was true everywhere—shared up to 50% of total royalties with a publisher. Consequently, there remained 25% for the songwriter and 25% for the composer. That is generally how it worked. That was quite a common model. And then a few pennies were paid per songrecorded on a widespread format, such as CDs, which are still in use. One of the differences between Canada and Europe was that, in Europe, the author had to be paid for the right to distribute CDs in stores.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862183"> If 100,000 copies of an artist's work were made, first it had to be proven that the composer of the musical work and the songwriter had received their few pennies per song, which could add up to a lot if it was a major success. We are not talking about $100,000, but, even if it was a few pennies, that gave them a decent income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862184"> In Canada, however, records could be distributed through merchants, in stores, without paying anything. Up to 20% could be considered “free goods”. That is what the merchants were given for promoting the product, and those “free goods” were exempt from copyright obligations. So 100,000 copies were distributed, but the first 20,000 copies did not generate a cent for the creator, and the other 80,000 copies had to be sold and had to be recorded as having been sold. Ultimately, the creator might receive his meagre 25% for a song recorded on a CD that eventually sold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862185"> That was something like telling a bricklayer to lay bricks at a shopping centre, but that he would not be paid for his work unless the shopping centre was successful and had customers and its tenants were happy and paid their rent. He could do the brickwork at the shopping centre but never get paid. The deep roots of that attitude toward copyright in Canada are evident in the failures of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862186"> I will conclude on this basic attitude because the problem of a toothless copyright regime that has been around for decades underscores a fundamental perception that must absolutely change in Canada. The success of a cultural product stems from something magical that comes from the artist, not from the investor, the broadcaster or the person who—admittedly—may have invested thousands or even millions of dollars in the distribution of an album, a disk or a book. It is the artist who suddenly manages to grasp the most interesting thing that is happening at a particular time and who suddenly finds an audience. When an artist does that, he deserves his copyright.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862187"> If we understand that, we can immediately see that attempts in this legislation to protect major broadcasters do not honour the artist’s medium- and long-term need to earn an adequate and decent income from new technologies. Often, people do not really understand that it is the creator's magic that makes the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862188"> If the major distributors had a magic potion and knew exactly how to produce an artistic product for one million dollars that would sell three million copies, they would do so every day. They attempt this regularly and, often, it does not work out. When it works, it is because there was something magical that came from the creators and had an effect on the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862189"> Things do not happen magically. Creators invests thousands of hours in practice and rehearsals, rewrite thousands of pages, and spend thousands of hours developing themselves culturally in order to become people who create magic. The fact that we are considering modernizing copyright—and that this is even in the title of the bill—and that the party in power has managed to conduct a smear campaign by conflating the notion of guaranteeing suitable copyright with a tax, represents a dangerous, slippery slope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862190"> In sectors of the industry that require a lot of creativity, the downward spiral has already begun. In video game production, for example, creators are often paid on a per-game basis. Young men and women are approached and asked to put together a beautiful soundtrack in exchange for $1,000. Regardless of its success, whether the video game in question is a hit and sells 75,000 copies, or is a total flop and only sells 200 copies, there is no copyright. That is what is called a buyout; the rights are purchased from the young creator. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862191"> That is the fate that awaits creators. Personally, I do not want to live in a world where creators can no longer live off copyright unless they produce a real hit. It means living in a less creative world. I do not need a <I>Rocky </I>127. In future decades, I want to see creators who create interesting music and arthouse films.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862212">In the 2011 Speech from the Throne, the Government of Canada committed to reintroduce and seek swift passage of legislation to modernize Canada's copyright law in a way that balances the needs of creators and users. This bill fulfills that promise.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862221">Over here we realize that this compromise is necessary, because consumers and artists are in fact two sides of the very same coin. They are the same equation. If artists do not trust the rules that protect their rights and govern Canada's digital economy, they will be reluctant to produce their content here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862222">The government and members of Parliament have heard that time and time again in the consultations we have held. We have also heard that if consumers are unable to enjoy and use the content in legal ways that make sense to them, there will not be a market for the artists' work. That is why we have created a bill that strikes the right balance between the needs of consumers and users, while at the same time making strong exemptions for educational purposes or fair dealing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862223">The bill is an important stepping stone to the establishment of a strong framework in which Canada's digital economy can thrive. We know that the economy is changing significantly. What we do now with smart phones, tablets and computers has taken our economy in a new direction, where artists and rights holders are using the digital economy not only to bring new art to market but also to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862240">I wonder how she would respond to the criticism that this is, basically, a sop to the big players who have been lobbying for these changes and that her government has now very nicely responded to them.</ParaText>

I quoted the exact numbers, but there were more than 9,000 consultations with the Canadian public, the business community and the artistic community. That is a lot of consultation. This is the longest consultation process in the history of Canada. It has been 15 years, and it is time we entered the 21st century.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862252">Madam Speaker, here is another opportunity to speak on the bill. I know the bill has been recycled a number of times. I think its earliest life actually came when the Liberals were in power. In fact, they laid the groundwork for the copyright bill we are dealing with today. In fact, I think my hon. colleague across the way mentioned this. This is possibly about the third time the bill has come forward, which to me is a very good example of why sometimes we need to have a thorough examination of legislation; in this particular case, the copyright legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862253">This is a very technical bill. I would be the first to say that I am certainly not an expert on this issue. I know that some of my colleagues have been really drilling down into this legislation to examine what exactly is involved, who wins, who loses and whether or not there is a balance. We have heard time and again from the Conservative members who have quoted the numbers, the level of consultation. Consultation is very important, especially on a bill that is so wide in its scope and would affect so many different sectors, from very large corporations to individual artists to consumers. There is a very wide spectrum of people who would be affected. Those consultations are very important. I certainly would not deny that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862254">However, I think at the end of the day, we do have a fundamental question. Will Canadians have copyright legislation that would actually work for them? Is this the right balance that has been found?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862255">I want to thank my colleagues on the committee who have worked so hard on the bill. In fact, not only did they work on the committee but they travelled across the country, as well, and heard from many individual Canadians and experts. We have had an enormous amount of feedback on the bill. In my own community of east Vancouver, which is home to many artists, I have had a lot of feedback on the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862256">Here we are, now, at the final stages of the bill and, unfortunately, that basic question is still before the House. Is this the right balance among consumers, creators and royalties, and would it unfairly kind of roll over to providing much greater support and a green light to some of the very large players?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862257">As many of my colleagues before me have said today, on this side of the House we believe, having now gone through committee, having posed many amendments to try to mitigate some of the worst aspects of the bill, that here we are now at the final stages and the bill, unfortunately, does not strike the right balance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862258">In fact, I would say it appears that all the attempts that have been made at copyright reform in recent years have had very little to do, in reality, with creating a regime that would balance the rights of creators and the public. Rather, it has been more about satisfying the demands of U.S. large content owners, and by that I mean the movie studios, the music labels, the video game developers et cetera. These are all things that are very pervasive in our culture, in our society. One only has to look at a younger generation to see how incredibly powerful these various cultural products are in our society. We could have a whole other debate about the ups and downs of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862259">However, we are very concerned that the bill is tilted toward satisfying the demands of those very large players. In fact, I was very surprised to read that, as a result of WikiLeaks' cables, there was even information about how the former minister's staff used influence and tried to generate a whole scene of pressure in the U.S. to put pressure on Canada to bring in a bill and to get this moving along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862260">I think that is just the tip of the iceberg. It is a revelation that shows us that powerful interests are involved in this issue of copyright, and who wins and who loses is very significant. Therefore, the fact that the bill has taken a long time and that it is now back in the House, I think, is a reflection of the complexities of that debate. There were many witnesses at committee who came forward to express their concerns.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862261"> Our concern is that the bill essentially gives with one hand while it takes away with the other. While we certainly acknowledge that there are some concessions for consumers, the reality is when we weigh it up that they are undermined by the government's refusal to compromise on what is probably the single most controversial aspect of the bill, the digital lock provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862262">The example I gave in questions and comments, as have other colleagues, is long distance education. Under the provisions, people would have to get rid of their school notes after 30 days. To us, this seems to be a very heavy-handed approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862263"> In fact, at committee, NDP members proposed deleting sections of the bill that would criminalize Canadians who, in breaking digital locks for non-commercial use in the normal course of work or school, would be penalized under the provisions of the bill. That is a pretty unfair element of the bill, which has not been resolved even though there were many attempts to bring forward amendments to resolve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862264">I want to segue a moment because, as I said, the bill has a very broad scope in terms of the number of people it impacts. The colleague from the Conservative Party earlier spoke about the budget implementation bill. I think she said that the Conservatives are growing the economy, and that made me think about what is really going on in this House. On the one hand we have this budget implementation bill that would fundamentally change many different regimes, whether it be environmental regulations and protections or health care. One of the changes involves EI. This is something that would have an impact on artists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862265"> It is quite astounding to know that The Conference Board of Canada estimated that the cultural sector in Canada generates approximately $25 billion in taxes for all levels of government. That was from 2007 and presumably it might be higher now. However, that is three times higher than what was actually spent on culture by all levels of government. What was spent was $7.9 billion, but $25 billion was collected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862266">The median income of an artist in Canada was just under $12,900; not the average but median, which is a much more realistic comparison. I represent a community where we have an incredible diversity of artists, most of whom have other jobs to support themselves, in the service sector, restaurants or maybe at home, but they are creators. They are people who contribute enormously to our society, our local communities, our history, our culture and our understanding of the experiences we all have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862267">It was very interesting to hear the member across the way talk about the budget implementation bill as it relates to the copyright bill and say it is all about growing the economy. This is a bill that would actually penalize and limit the scope of artists in this country. When we look at what their income is and how much they struggle, it should very much concern us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862268">At the end of the day we took a hard shot at this bill. We really worked in good faith because there are some elements that are adequate, but mostly there are not. I know that our folks on the committee tried to find ways to bring forward amendments. However, if it was like our health committee, anything that we proposed automatically got shut down, which in and of itself is an affront to democratic practice. Unfortunately, that has become the practice in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862269">We are still opposed to this bill because the balance has not been found. It is still tilted in favour of the really big players.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862281">Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the importance of Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the copyright modernization act, and its important role in creating a modern, dynamic, 21st century intellectual property framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862282">Intellectual property affects all sectors of our economy. It comprises, among other rights, patents, trademarks, industrial design, and today's subject, of course, copyright. The logo on our baseball hat, a new and innovative drug, a work of art, a video game for our PlayStation, a song for our iPod or BlackBerry, all of these are rooted in intellectual property. That is why protecting IP is so important for consumers who demand better products, for businesses that create them and for our economy that grows as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862283">Let me take a few moments to expand on some of the main forms of IP and what they mean. Copyright protects the expression of ideas and applies to all original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and computer programs. Our copyright regime ensures that only the copyright owner is allowed to produce or reproduce the works, or allow someone else to do so. Through Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>, our government would modernize this regime to ensure that it is relevant and responsive in today's digital world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862284">Patent rights enable inventors to create a market space in which to make, use or sell their invention in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862285">Trademarks enable businesses to identify themselves using words, designs and other means. Trademarks ensure that products are what they say they are, which is essential for informed consumer choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862286">As we move forward with the modernization of our copyright framework, it is useful to reflect on the important role that IP has played, and continues to play, in our economy. Certainly, as member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation>, the centre of innovation in Canada, I understand and appreciate the important role of IP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862287">Why do we have rights protecting IP? Protecting IP ensures that a person's idea, a company's product or an artist's creation has an economic value, and it allows its owners to earn from their creations. By providing temporary exclusive rights, IP protection creates incentives to innovate and inspires creativity. At the same time, by providing limitations to these exclusive rights, Canada's IP regime provides for access and supports the dissemination of knowledge. In short, IP protection prevents competitors from copying or closely imitating products or services, and allows businesses to bank on potential returns on investment. This creates economic growth, jobs and prosperity across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862288">IP preserves the competitive edge that a business or a person acquires through research and development and marketing, inventiveness or creativity. It allows dynamic entrepreneurs to answer unsatisfied market domain or open up new market frontiers. It allows businesses to develop goodwill through branding strategies that help them retain customers by ensuring that a brand is consistently associated with a level of quality of products or services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862289">In addition to protecting ingenuity and creativity, IP helps instill trust, confidence and loyalty in consumers. All of us in the House no doubt know and trust many Canadian products. IP protection ensures that these brands are protected against piracy and counterfeit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862290">In the digital age where data and information can travel around the world in the blink of an eye, the role of IP has never been greater. That is why now, more than ever, Canadian companies are concerned not only about the nature of the rights that are granted, but also about the effectiveness of their enforcement, both here in Canada and abroad.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862291">That is why Canada signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreements in October 2011, demonstrating our commitment to combatting the trade in counterfeit and pirated goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862292"> I am proud of our government's introduction of the copyright modernization legislation, which is before us today. This bill would strengthen copyright protections and modernize our copyright regime to bring it in line with international standards and with the realities of the digital age. Specifically, it would provide a clear framework for businesses to be able to protect their creative content, reach new markets, reinvest in further innovation through the development of new business models, and combat infringement in a digital environment, particularly online piracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862293">This bill would implement the rights and protections that are set out in the World Intellectual Property Organization Internet treaties which were signed in 1997 and never ratified here in Canada. For too long we have been outside the consensus on modern protections for IP. With this bill, that would no longer be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862294">The bill would provide legal protection for businesses that choose, choose being the operative word, to use digital locks to protect their intellectual property as part of their business models. It would also give copyright owners the tools to pursue those who wilfully and knowingly enable copyright infringement online, such as operators of websites that enable illegal file sharing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862295">Rights holders would also benefit from legal protection for rights management information. For example, these provisions would prevent the removal of a digital watermark for the purposes of facilitating infringement. The bill would give innovative companies the certainty they need to develop new products and services that involve legitimate uses of copyright material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862296">Software companies would be allowed explicitly to engage in encryption research, security testing, compatibility testing and reverse engineering. This would support the growth of a competitive third party software market in Canada, spurring follow-on innovation. It would make clear that temporary reproductions made during a technological process are not a violation of copyright.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862297">Finally, the bill would clarify the roles and responsibilities of intermediaries, such as ISPs and search engines. Copyright modernization is a major element of the intellectual property regime in Canada. In this digital age, it is vital that we act now to pass Bill <Document DbId="5134851" Type="3">C-11</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862298">Modern copyright is a springboard for a growing digital economy and the foundation for any future digital economy strategy. In passing this bill, we would enhance Canada's innovative capacity, create the necessary environment for growth in our dynamic innovation-driven industries and foster Canadian creativity. All of this would mean jobs, growth and long-term prosperity, something that all members of this House should welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862299"> I urge all hon. members to join me in supporting this bill and ensuring that the copyright modernization legislation can proceed to the Senate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862301">I really liked what he said in his speech because he talked about the government's true intention, which is to make the focus of this legislation intellectual property and commercialization. In the context of this debate, it just so happens that the English term and the French term do not mean exactly the same thing. In English, “copyright” is the right to copy, while in French, “droit d'auteur” is the creator's right to compensation. There are certainly differences between the two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862302">My point is that I agree we should respect copyright holders. However, there may be a problem in terms of compensation for creators, but he did not have much to say about that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862670">Mr. Speaker, last fall the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> announced, effective immediately, a moratorium on new applications to sponsor parents and grandparents to immigrate to Canada. This unfair punishment for new Canadians and Canadian permanent residents is compounded by new measures recently introduced in the punishing refugees act, also known as Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document>, which will place a mandatory five-year wait time for refugees to become permanent residents and apply to reunite with their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862671">The last time I asked the minister about this issue, he blamed the problem of the backlog of applications on the Liberals. We continue to hear the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> claim that his department is increasing and speeding up the reunification for family members, but with this moratorium on family reunification and a five-year bar for refugees, the Conservative government is making it harder for families to stay together. The Conservative government has to take responsibility for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862672">Parents and grandparents wait an average of seven years to come to Canada. One family in my riding has waited over 16 years. Now, people will have to wait an additional five years on top of an already lengthy separation. But wait, this excruciatingly long countdown for parents to see their children, and grandparents to see their grandchildren will not begin until 2014. The government will not be accepting new applications to sponsor parents and grandparents until 2014, if at all. While we know there is a substantial backlog for family class applicants, refusing to reunify families is not the way to deal with the backlog. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862673">Working as the member of Parliament for Scarborough—Rouge River, I have spoken with many families who have been waiting years and years to have their parents and grandparents join them here in Canada. We all know the benefits of having our parents and grandparents here with us. We understand the value of reuniting families. I am lucky enough to have had my grandparents join me here in Canada from Sri Lanka. They have added so much value to my life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862674">We need to address the existing inequities in the system and develop a balanced and equitable approach to dealing with the backlog. This includes raising the overall level of immigration and the number of immigrants that we accept each year to approach approximately 1% of the population. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862676">Mr. Speaker, certainly with the response the minister gave to the member's question and the position that our government has taken on this issue, the member either has not been listening very closely or she does not respect the fact that we have taken huge strides when it comes to family reunification and, in fact, when it comes to the immigration system overall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862677">The member shows a lack of respect for the 30-plus hours of witness testimony which brought the issues to our attention. Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document> is going to change the way the refugee system in this country works for the positive in the sense that it will do more for those who are true refugees. It will also ensure that those who are not true refugees will not clog up our system, which hurts those who truly need assistance, and has a huge impact on the Immigration and Refugee Board and the immigration system as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862678">Specifically, the one thing the member did not respond to, and which her party said it supported, as did the third party, is how we have dealt with the issue of the family class with respect to parents and grandparents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862679">We implemented the super visa program late in the fall of 2011 and it can only be described as a tremendous success. In fact, the super visa does something no other visa did before. It allows parents and grandparents who would like to visit their children and grandchildren to apply for a 10-year visa to come to this country. The super visa allows parents and grandparents to come to Canada for up to two years to stay and visit with their family and assist with the upbringing of children if that is their wish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862680">The fact is, that program had to be implemented because there was a backlog of over 165,000 applications which started way before we formed government. In fact, it was never dealt with by the previous administration and it put us in a position of having to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862681">In 2011, to work through that backlog, we increased by 60% the number of parents and grandparents who are allowed to come into this country. We implemented the super visa which has put families and parents in a position to come here faster and to stay for a period of up to two years. The only requirement is that they get their own health insurance so that when they are here, they do not put a burden on Canada's health care system. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862682">Mr. Speaker, it is sad that the parliamentary secretary thinks that refugees clog up our system when these are people who are fleeing situations of persecution or oppression from wherever they are coming. They are asylum seekers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862683">The parliamentary secretary needs to stop blaming the backlog on the previous Liberal government. I agree that the Liberals handled it poorly, but for the last six years, the government has not done much to make the situation any better. It has actually made it worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862684">Family reunification and family support are extremely important factors for healthy and effective integration of our newer immigrants in Canada. People who have faced war, who have faced traumatic experiences beyond our imagination will no longer have access to this vital support system, and thanks to the amendments to our immigration laws, including Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document>, they will now be revictimized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862686">Mr. Speaker, I will repeat in response to the point being made by the member that we actually have a refugee system that is broken. Over 60% of the applicants are actually denied their applications to become permanent residents or to achieve asylum here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862687">We have a system in which more than 60% of those who apply are actually not deemed to be true refugees. Those are the people I am speaking about in terms of clogging up our system and putting us in a position of not being able to help those who are truly in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862688">With respect to the family class, I have said we have a system that is broken. Having to wait eight, nine, or ten years to come to this country with the program that was in place is not acceptable. We have put in place a moratorium that will allow us to work through the backlog. The super visa program allows parents to get here to see their children and grandchildren much, much quicker.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862689">Mr. Speaker, I asked a question of the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> on the development of our natural resources. I said that the Conservatives are not listening to the public. I would like to expand on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862690">We figure that the Conservatives' approach to natural resources management is unbalanced. We have to change that approach to natural resources to make it more profitable for Canadians. How would we do this? First, we need a made for Canada national energy strategy that prioritizes the Canadian interest. What the Conservatives are trying to do right now is export all of our oil to other countries. If we had a strategy that looked after the interests of all Canadians from coast to coast to coast, it would be profitable not only for Canadians, but also for the oil industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862691">When we are exporting our oil overseas, we are also exporting jobs. For some reason, the Conservatives are more interested in creating jobs in the U.S. and China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862692">During some meetings of the natural resources committee, we heard expert testimony from CEP that for every 400,000 barrels of oil exported, we exported at the same time 18,000 jobs. That is a lot of jobs to export to other countries. If we want to save these jobs, we should upgrade our refineries in Canada and refine our oil right here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862693">At committee we often hear the Conservatives say that we have no market for Canadian oil. If we transfer the oil to China, Japan or the U.S.A., they will find a market for the oil that they refine. Saying that we do not have a market is no excuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862694">If we were to have an energy strategy, we would have security throughout the country. What the Conservatives are doing right now is exporting our oil, yet on the east coast we are importing oil from unstable countries like Saudi Arabia. What is wrong with shipping oil from western Canada to eastern Canada where it could heat Canadian homes?</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="170846" Type="18">Mr. David Anderson (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources and for the Canadian Wheat Board, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862695">Mr. Speaker, I am actually very encouraged to hear the member opposite say that he supports the reversal of the line to eastern Canada because I am not sure that is his party's position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862696">The NDP's Canada energy strategy, as near as I can tell, would mean sitting in the dark eating veggies and we are not prepared to do that just yet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862697">I will begin by talking about the refining sector, which he mentioned. We are proud of Canada's refining sector. Through responsible and market-based policies, which are foreign to the NDP, we refine more oil than can be used in Canada. He did not mention that. We refine more crude oil than we can consume, with exports of refined petroleum products to the United States of over 400,000 barrels per day. That makes us a major player in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862698">It is disappointing that my colleague opposite, from what is rapidly becoming known as the no development party, did not learn anything from our committee's study of refining capacity in Canada. Perhaps he should go back and read the report. In the meantime, I will take a couple of minutes to remind him of some of the testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862699">We heard that Canadian refineries face some economic challenges. They are operating at an 80% to 84% utilization rate when, to be fully profitable, they need to be at over 90%. Building more refineries when the current refineries are not even operating at full capacity is just the type of economics the NDP is famous for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862700">North America's demand for gasoline is actually declining. He did not mention that either. He also did not mention that refining is a capital-intensive business. The cost of building a new refinery is $5 billion to $10 billion, with a 40 year return on investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862701">We believe the decisions about increasing refining capacity is a private-sector decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862702">What I would like the member opposite to explain is the NDP's contradiction on subsidies to oil companies. It says on one hand that it is opposed to all subsidies but on the other hand it wants more refineries built. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862703">The private sector has told us that it is not building more refineries. So I guess, as the member opposite knows, the only other way to do that is through massive subsidization. It may come as a shock to him but the refineries to this point have been owned by the oil companies. Is he suggesting that the government and the taxpayers should be building and owning new refineries in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862704">Does the member want to subsidize refineries or not? He says, yes. That is interesting. I think Canadians would be interested in hearing that he wants them to buy into an industry that is already overcapacity in this country. As I have seen in my home province of Saskatchewan, that is how NDP economics work and, in the end, they do not work well for the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862705">We have heard at committee that pipelines are the safest and most efficient means of transporting large quantities of crude oil and natural gas over land. I would not be surprised if my colleague opposite is ignoring that testimony as well because he was one of the NDP members who travelled to Washington, to our largest trading partner, to try to get it to reject Canadian oil and the Canadian pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862706">The NDP takes the puzzling position of supporting job creation by opposing all job creating projects in our natural resources sector. Our government is taking a different approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862707">I have tried to find a job creating project that the NDP actually supports but I have not been able to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862708">Every time the member opposite and members in his party stand in the House, it is to rant against the economic opportunities that are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in economic growth across this country. They criticize everything. They praise nothing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862712">We need to upgrade our refineries. In his province of Alberta, we could upgrade the refineries and create thousands of jobs, instead of building pipelines where the jobs for building a pipeline last two years. If we were to build refineries, we could create long-lasting, good paying Alberta jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862716">Third, it wants to build refineries but it opposes all pipelines. Pipelines are required to transport the oil. I guess that means that we will refine the oil and then what? Let it sit at the refinery?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862717">Fourth, while the resource sector employs hundreds of thousands of Canadians, the NDP seems to also believe that these jobs are a disease. While the NDP has said that it supports some energy projects, we cannot find one that it actually supports.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862719">Mr. Speaker, today I rise in this House once again to address the problematic Neuville airport file, because the <Affiliation DbId="170701" Type="96">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> continues to ignore it and has tried to sweep it under the carpet from the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862720">Since the very beginning of the project, the constituents have been opposed to the airport being built. They are deeply worried about losing their quality of life and about the deterioration of their health and that of their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862721">I am now going to explain the file more clearly to the hon. members opposite, who do not seem concerned in the slightest. The runway in Neuville is approximately 200 feet from houses where people live. So planes would fly over the houses of people who have lived there for years. Those people were there long before the promoters came. There are also other residences in the area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862722">Even though he has never set foot there, the Minister says that Canadians' safety is not at stake, that everything is fine and dandy, that everything is safe. This shows that he clearly does not know what he is talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862723">Speaking of ignorance, I would also like to remind the <Affiliation DbId="170701" Type="96">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> that the municipal council and the constituents have been against the airport project right from the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862724">The minister constantly hides behind the memorandum of understanding to justify his failure to take action on this issue. The memorandum was signed between the city and the developers to protect the citizens, and that is what the <Affiliation DbId="170700" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> is refusing to do right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862725">The sole purpose of the memorandum of understanding that we have been hearing so much about is to regulate operations that will take place at the airport in order to minimize the negative consequences of increased air traffic over the town. The parties came up with this solution because the government had nothing to offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862726">If the <Affiliation DbId="170700" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> had taken the time to sit down and talk to Bernard Gaudreau, the mayor of Neuville, as it happens—I wanted to mention that to give the minister some context—he would know that the memorandum does not mean the city has agreed to the project. It is a last resort in response to the government’s lack of support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862727">The root of the problem is the fact that, under the current Aeronautics Act, private developers who want to build an airport can do so wherever in Canada they want to, as long as they obey basic safety rules established by Transport Canada. Developers do not even have to notify anyone of the existence of their runway on the land. They do not have to register their airport if they do not want to. Verifications will not necessarily be done. This poses a problem, because municipalities have no way of becoming involved in the process in order to have their say and be consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862728">The provinces and municipalities have their own areas of jurisdiction that are guaranteed by the Constitution, including, for instance, land use, municipal planning and the protection of agricultural land. These jurisdictions are not being respected in the context of the Aeronautics Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862729">On the one hand, the federal government refuses to take full responsibility in its exclusive jurisdiction and, on the other hand, it also refuses to allow the provinces and municipalities to legislate in their own areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862730">The airport problem is a direct result of the legislative gap that exists in the Aeronautics Act. This situation needs to be rectified because it could affect every Canadian municipality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862731"> Moreover, I think that the minister was wrong to claim today that the Neuville file is settled. Section 4.9 of the Aeronautics Act stipulates, among other things, that the minister has the authority to legislate concerning the location and operation of airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862732"> With all this information, how can the minister still justify his inaction? How can he categorically refuse to meet with the mayor of Neuville?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862733"> When the Minister of Transport was a reeve and a mayor, I strongly doubt that he tolerated the same degree of intransigence and contempt on the part of the sitting Minister of Transport. So why is the minister refusing to act to preserve the quality of life of the residents of Neuville?</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="170851" Type="18">Mr. Pierre Poilievre (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities and for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862734">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by stating that the role of Transport Canada is to promote the establishment of a safe, secure, effective and environmentally friendly transportation network in Canada. I am aware that a request for an injunction to halt activities at the airport was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, and the minister's officials are keeping a close eye on the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862735"> Although the placement of airports is exclusively a federal area of jurisdiction, Transport Canada is encouraging stakeholders in the aeronautics community to respect relevant and applicable provincial and municipal regulations, and to listen to the public in order to promote aeronautical activities that are respectful of the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862736"> In this particular case, the site chosen by the developer is outside a residential area. The minister's policy in this regard is therefore to encourage the management and resolution of potential conflicts at the local level by the parties concerned—that is, issues that are likely to affect the whole municipality when an airport project is on the drawing board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862737"> The minister is in favour of solutions that strike a balance between the development of the aviation sector and disturbances that may be caused by aeronautical activities. Transport Canada is going to great lengths within the scope of its mandate, and in collaboration with community and industry partners, to mitigate impacts on the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862738"> Moreover, the memorandum of understanding signed by the City of Neuville and the developer of the Neuville airport, formally demonstrates the intention of the parties concerned to collaborate harmoniously. The restrictions on airport operating hours contained in the memorandum are concrete evidence that there is a willingness on both sides to work together in a harmonious fashion, and we hope that there will be an effort made, in this spirit, to look for solutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862739"> A liaison committee will also be struck in order to promote and maintain this spirit of collaboration between the airport and the residents of the community. This is a further indication of the willingness of the parties concerned to work together to find a common and appropriate solution, and I salute this initiative.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862740">Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member did not hear anything I said or did not listen; we will need to see what choice he has made. I repeat: the airport is built in an inhabited area. There are houses and the flight path passes directly above those houses. The people were there long before the airport was built. It is not because it is a rural area that is not inhabited. The houses are simply farther apart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862741">The parliamentary secretary tells me that they want to find a solution that respects the community, but what is going on in Neuville right now does not respect the community or what it wants. The municipal council was against the airport, and the citizens have spoken out against it many times. So, how can we provide a balance in this entire situation if the minister refuses to even talk to the mayor? He is refusing to speak to the people who are experiencing the negative consequences of the airport directly. I live in Neuville and I hear the airplanes flying over the city.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862742">Of course, a memorandum of understanding exists, and its clauses specify that air traffic should be reduced to a minimum over the city. But when I was there last week, I heard at least 30 airplanes. So how is the memorandum of understanding satisfactory? Why is the department not getting involved in this situation, which is not regulated by the existing legislation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862744">It is also true that all Canadians want airports to be in another municipality. If we allow every municipality to refuse to permit an airport or an airfield, there would not be any in the country. What the hon. member is proposing will never happen, regardless of the government or its political stripes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862745">I suggest that she work with the municipalities, the other partners and the government in order to find a solution that suits the local population and our national aviation system, a system that is necessary and essential.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862818">As we all know, one of the main duties of Environment Canada is to develop, implement, monitor and enforce science-based environmental standards and regulations across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862819">This year, we are focusing on simplifying and increasing the efficiency and transparency of our regulatory processes to make them more effective. The department is strongly committed to growing as a world-class regulatory organization, and it will continue to improve its track record of regulatory excellence.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2862820">My department has made steady progress in a number of key areas. Working in partnership with Alberta, I announced on February 3 an historic plan for implementing a world-class, comprehensive and transparent environmental monitoring plan in the oil sands. This plan will deliver rigorous scientific data to ensure that the oil sands are developed in an environmentally sustainable manner. My department will monitor water, air and biodiversity, and it will be among the most transparent and most accountable systems of its kind in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862821">Monitoring will be carried out in more places, more frequently, for more substances. For example, by 2015 we will add up to 22 new water sites, 11 new air sites, and over 37 new biodiversity sites. The dedicated scientists in my department have already begun collecting crucial measurements during the spring melt and the ice breakup. Throughout this process, we have been engaging industry, independent scientists, aboriginal peoples and other stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862822">Canada is making significant progress in reducing Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 through a sector-by-sector plan. In fact, federal measures, combined with actions taken by provinces, brought us one-quarter of the way toward our 2020 target a year ago, and we have made significant progress since then. Emissions have declined in almost all sectors, including oil and gas and electricity generation, since 2005. Between 2009 and 2010, our emissions remained virtually steady, despite economic growth of 3.2%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862823">More progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is forthcoming, following on publication of our final cold-fired electricity regulations in coming weeks and the proposed heavy duty vehicle regulations I recently announced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862824">All of these proposed regulations will help enhance Canada's position as a world leader in clean energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862825">We are now moving forward to develop regulated performance standards for other major emitting industrial sectors. We have already initiated an engagement process with the oil and gas sector and the provinces to enable ongoing consultation on regulatory development. We plan a similar engagement as we move forward to develop regulations for other emissions in intensive industrial sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862826">My department will also continue its efforts to improve air quality by working with provinces, industry and non-governmental organizations to implement the air quality management system. This system is a comprehensive consensus-based approach to reducing air pollutant emissions and improving air quality across Canada, eventually in partnership with the U.S. along the lines of the acid rain treaty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862827"> Furthermore, under the next phase of Canada's chemicals management plan, our department is working with partners to assess and regulate a multitude of chemicals used in thousands of industrial and consumer products. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862828">As part of the action plan for clean water, in 2011 the Government of Canada invested almost $3 million for the cleanup of Lake Simcoe and almost $400,000 for nine new community projects to clean up Lake Winnipeg. Negotiations with the United States to modernize the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement have been successful. The process to amend the agreement is nearing completion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862829">Significant resources were invested in the Great Lakes for the cleanup of contaminated sites, reduction of harmful algae blooms, waste water infrastructure and science and research. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862830">We are also taking action to protect and conserve Canada's rich and abundant biodiversity. Under our new Plan Saint-Laurent, we are working with Quebec to ensure water quality, to protect ecologically sensitive areas and to conserve the incredible biodiversity of that mighty river. In that regard, the Canada-Quebec agreement on the St. Lawrence was signed and announced in Montreal last November. This new agreement sets out the St. Lawrence action plan up to 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862831">Under budget 2012, $50 million over two years is being provided to support updated application of the Species at Risk Act. This money will support improvements to the program that respond to submissions made during and after the parliamentary review of the act in 2009 and 2010. These changes will deliver greater conservation benefits, reduce the need for direct federal intervention and provide greater certainty for partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862832">On the international stage, Canada has played a significant role in advancing work toward a new international climate agreement for the future. The Durban platform for enhanced action took an important step forward by setting out a negotiating mandate for all countries to develop a single new international treaty to include all major emitters to be implemented by 2020. This has been a long-standing objective of our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862833">We have invested and continue to invest $1.2 billion in fast-start financing to help developing countries address global climate change. Canada is also working with international partners to reduce short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon and methane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862834">There has been much talk—and great exaggeration, misrepresentation and few factual references—about the changes to environmental assessments under the responsible resource development initiative. My colleagues will speak to this matter in detail later in the debate, but let me just say that our government takes environmental protection very seriously. We are amending outdated and inefficient elements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act in order to modernize the environmental assessment processes and strengthen enforcement provisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862835">For the first time, for example, federal inspectors will have authority to examine whether conditions in an environmental assessment decision statement are actually met. When passed, Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> would allow for monetary penalties that range from $100,000 to $400,000 for non-compliance. These are real penalties meant to ensure compliance and to safeguard Canadians. They complement the much greater stiffening of regulations under CEPA a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862836">Environment Canada has also focused its resources to address areas of highest concern to Canadians, such as severe weather. I announced investments to strengthen weather monitoring infrastructure, ensuring Canadians continued access to world-class weather, water and climate monitoring data, and we will continue to provide Canadians with a comprehensive national weather, water and climate monitoring system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862837">I must say that I am very proud of the accomplishments and dedication of this government vis-à-vis the environment. We are serving Canadians every day and protecting Canada for years to come. Our government's economic action plan is creating jobs and growth for Canadians now and in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862838">In conclusion, I take this opportunity to thank members present on both sides of the House for their interest in the work of my department and I welcome their questions throughout the evening.</ParaText>

We have closed 42% of the major contaminated sites that we have targeted. We are halfway through a 15 year program, and we will proceed.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862902">Madam Chair, I would like to focus my comments on environmental assessment and the work of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. This, of course, is a key part of the environment portfolio and a very important part of what the federal government does. The funding being considered as part of the main estimates is necessary for the continued application of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, and preparation for the implementation of the proposals in Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> should that legislation receive royal assent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862903">Environmental assessment sits at a crucial intersection between the environment and the economy. Environmental assessment is a way to ensure responsible resource development. It allows the Government of Canada to assess and mitigate the environmental impacts of projects that represent billions of dollars of potential investment for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862904">While founded upon the best of intentions, the current federal process is overly complex and dated. Accountability is spread across government, and there have been inconsistent application and delays as a result. This situation actually harms the economy. Project proponents face unnecessary costs. Investment decisions are put off. Jobs for Canadians are put on hold. The argument can be made that this actually harms the environment, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862905">Limited government resources are consumed by unnecessary process steps and the need to assess small projects that pose minimal risk to the environment. There are also few enforcement provisions. The current law is based on concepts and approaches from the late 1980s. It is time to build on our record and move forward. It is time to modernize federal environmental assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862906">A responsible resource development plan sets out a path to modernization that relies on four pillars: one, making reviews more predictable and timely; two, reducing duplication; three, strengthening environmental protection; and four, enhancing consultation with aboriginal peoples. The new Canadian environmental assessment act supports all four pillars through responsible and certain timelines, better integration of federal and provincial responsibilities to avoid duplication, fair and consistent enforcement measures to ensure the environment is protected, and an explicit requirement to ensure that changes to the environment that affect aboriginal peoples are assessed and mitigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862907">Environmental assessment is receiving much attention, inside and outside the House, as part of the debate on Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, the jobs, growth and long-term prosperity act. Let me take this opportunity to set the record straight on some of the myths that have unfortunately dominated this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862908">The first myth is that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency budget has been cut by over 40%. Perhaps members have heard that. The opposite is true. At a time of fiscal restraint, the agency's capacity has been protected. Its budget is in fact increasing by 5% as a result of budget 2012. Additional funds are being provided for consultations with aboriginal peoples. Fundamentally, the provision of funding to the agency will ensure that it continues to provide Canadians with high quality environmental assessments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862909">The second myth permeating this debate is that environmental assessment is somehow being gutted by Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>. A brief comparison between the current law and the bill is in order to explain this point. As I just noted, the government is providing additional funding to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency because we expect it to do more, not less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862910">For an environmental assessment to be required under the current act, there has to be a federal decision associated with the project. No decision means no environmental assessment, even though there might be serious effects on matters within federal jurisdiction. The bill proposes to address this gap. An environmental assessment may be required when there are adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and the project is on the project list or specifically designated by the minister. A federal decision about the project is not a prerequisite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862911">When there is a federal decision associated with the project undergoing an environmental assessment, the environmental effects of that decision will be assessed. This is a requirement today. This is a requirement in the updated act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862912">The current law requires follow-up programs for major projects. These follow-up programs verify if mitigation measures are protecting the environment. Unfortunately, application of this requirement has been fragmented across government. Follow-up information is not being put to the best use possible.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="20">(2220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2862913">The bill proposes to fix this problem. Follow-up programs would be mandatory after all environmental assessments. The results would flow to one of three responsible authorities: the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the National Energy Board. These bodies would use this information to help manage unanticipated environmental effects and improve the practice of environmental assessment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862914">A final area of comparison relates to enforcement. The current law has no enforcement provisions. This is a very significant shortcoming. As parliamentarians we expect bills to be enforced when they become law. Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> proposes to make this the case for environmental assessment through several measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862915">The act would prohibit a proponent from proceeding with a project identified in regulations unless it underwent an environmental assessment or the agency decided that one is not required. At the end of an environmental assessment, proponents would have to comply with the conditions set out in a decision statement. Federal inspectors for the first time would have the authority to examine whether conditions in an environmental assessment decision statement were met. Finally, there are proposed penalties for violations that range from $100,000 to $400,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862916">Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> proposes to close gaps in what projects can be subjected to a federal environmental assessment. It would strengthen how follow-up information is managed and used. New enforcement powers would be provided. All of this adds up to a strengthening of environmental assessment in a significant way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862917">Now I would like to turn to the third myth. Some are saying that the government has not consulted nor heard from Canadians on how to improve environmental assessment. There has been a wealth of input from various sources under both this government and the previous government. Let me run through some of the highlights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862918">In 2003, the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development issued a report entitled “Beyond Bill C-9”. Among other things, the standing committee recommended creating a system of environmental assessment permits. Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> proposes to do so through the enforceable environmental assessment decision statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862919">The standing committee also recommended that the agency look into the use of regional environmental assessments as a means to deal with cumulative effects of multiple projects and activities. This examination of the potential of regional studies was done in cooperation with provinces and territories through a task group of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 2008-09. The result can be seen in proposed provisions for regional studies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862920">In 2004, the government appointed the external advisory committee on smart regulation. Environmental assessment was the issue that generated the most complaints from stakeholders during this study of the broader federal regulatory system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862921">The smart regulation committee recommended the creation of a single federal agency for environmental assessment, better integration of federal-provincial assessments, timelines and more emphasis on follow-up programs. Proposals consistent with the spirit of these recommendations are all found in Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862922">In 2009, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment also issued a discussion paper and held consultations on the issue of one project, one review. The outcome is reflected in the bill's proposal for substitution and equivalency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862923">These new tools allow provincial environmental assessments to substitute for, or be recognized as equivalent to, a federal review as long as the substance of requirements of the act are met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862924">The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development members, many of whom are in the House tonight, reviewed the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act this past year. The majority of the committee's recommendations have found their way into the bill, including the use of a project list to avoid requiring assessments of small projects, such as a blueberry washing facility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862925">This project list approach includes a safety net authority for the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> to require the environmental assessment of a project not identified in the regulations. This power could be used in unique circumstances where a relatively routine type of project is of concern because of its proposed location, for example, in a sensitive environmental setting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862926">Two standing committee reports, a public consultation by federal and provincial governments and a blue ribbon committee have all contributed to the development of this important bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862927">We have listened to what is being said about environmental assessment over the past decade. We are moving forward to protect the environment while promoting jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText>

In fact, we co-operate on a number of different areas and his department enforces section 36 of the Fisheries Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862929"> It is somewhat sad that, even with the best of intentions, we can have the best regulations but if there is no way to enforce those regulations we will not get anywhere. One of those anomalous situations is when, for example, the <Affiliation DbId="170675" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> issues an authorization for some work to be done and attaches conditions to that authorization and then someone does not abide by those conditions of the authorization, there is no ability in the current Fisheries Act for that to be addressed. So there have been many calls, maybe because of that and other things, to improve the current habitat enforcement provisions. The responsible resource development plan announced a number of measures to enhance compliance and enforcement and I wonder if the minister could outline some of those for us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2862931">The responsible resource development act seeks to modernize and strengthen environmental protection for natural resource developments in Canada. Our government made the first round of reforms to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act in budget 2010, when we started the process of providing predictable timelines for project assessments. We are continuing this process in a government-wide approach now, including assessments conducted by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, the National Energy Board and the Department of Fisheries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862932">At the end of these assessments, proponents will be unable to proceed unless they comply with conditions set out clearly in the assessment. As I told the House a few moments ago, failure to comply with mitigation measures can result in significant monetary penalties from $100,000 to $400,000. These penalties help give teeth to our already effective environmental protection regime.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="2862996">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise this evening to salute the remarkable work carried out by my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, who has the opportunity this evening to explain in greater detail his action plan and its measures, not only for the stewardship of our ecosystems throughout the country, but also his strategies for the management of drinking water and sewage, for air quality and, of course, for the reduction of greenhouse gases. As the minister explained, the results in this regard are compelling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862997">We are already a third of the way to meeting our objective, established in the Copenhagen accord, of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 17% by 2020. Already, there has been a reduction of approximately 48 megatonnes as compared to 2005. We are, therefore, well on track to meeting our objectives—thanks to the regulatory framework established by the minister—particularly in the transport sector, which covers a quarter of our country's greenhouse gas emissions. We are also making progress in the areas of electricity, coal, and the oil and gas sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862998">This action plan provides convincing results, and what is more, we still have a few years left to achieve these outcomes, as our objective was set for 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2862999"> I am also pleased to rise this evening as a Quebecker, since my remarks have to do with the St. Lawrence River, which is the backbone of Quebec, and in some ways, of the entire country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863000"> The St. Lawrence plan includes measures we have put in place to ensure the sustainability and conservation of the St. Lawrence River. The St. Lawrence is one of the highest priority ecosystems in Canada. It is an environment inhabited by numerous species and is a major source of drinking water and resources for the population. It is a pillar of economic development; it generates billions of dollars in economic activity. That is why the health of this ecosystem is crucial to a prosperous Quebec and Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863001"> It is also why the governments of Canada and Quebec wish to pursue measures undertaken initially by the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in 1988, by creating the first ever St. Lawrence action plan in order to protect and restore the St. Lawrence River. Since 1988, this plan has produced results. Indeed, the Canadian government invested heavily and obtained tangible results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863002"> The toxic liquid waste of 50 of the most polluting plants along the St. Lawrence was reduced by 96%. We have also protected 100,000 hectares of natural habitats by creating and expanding parks, ecological reserves and wildlife sanctuaries, and by establishing conservation agreements. We have also published a list of species likely to be designated as threatened or vulnerable, which may be given protected status under Quebec's Loi sur les espèces menacées ou vulnérables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863003"> We have also created the Saguenay–Saint-Laurent Marine Park, the foremost marine park in Canada. We have redeveloped and reopened Montreal's Lachine Canal, 20 years after it was closed. Furthermore, 10,000 inspections of agricultural companies from six targeted regions have been carried out in order to identify the nonpoint-source pollution that may be affecting the quality of water in the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863004">Just a few months ago, in November 2011, the government pursued this course of action with the St. Lawrence action plan 2011-2026. I was honoured to join Quebec's sustainable development, environment and parks minister, Mr. Arcand, and our own <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> to announce the plan at the Old Port of Montreal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863005">The agreement involves some 18 federal and Quebec departments, which are working together and taking meaningful action on behalf of the people by improving and maintaining the quality of the St. Lawrence ecosystem. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="50">(2250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863006">By 2016, the Government of Canada will have invested $49 million and the Government of Quebec $20.6 million to initiate dozens of projects in key areas, such as maintaining biodiversity and improving water quality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863007">We plan to focus on sources of agricultural pollution and the effects of emerging substances, such as pharmaceutical products. We want to improve contaminated sediment management tools and learn more about nonpoint-source pollution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863008">The work on evasive alien species must continue. We will protect environmentally sensitive areas through programs aimed at identifying protected areas and conserving biodiversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863009"> Furthermore, we will promote responsible fishery management and designate public access sites. We will support sustainable navigation activities and consolidate hydrometric data on water levels and supplies.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="2863010">This new agreement between the Canadian government and the Quebec government is another example of partnership in the spirit of open federalism and of the excellent co-operation that is taking place with the Quebec government in many areas. This agreement breaks new ground with a numerical environmental prediction program that will also serve as an important decision-making tool. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863011">Environment Canada has been supporting ZIP—priority intervention zones—committees and Stratégies Saint-Laurent since 1993 through an annual funding envelope of $1.1 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863012">Lastly, in addition to engaging various federal and provincial departments, this plan makes room for community projects through the community interaction program. The $12.4 million allocated through this program since 1993 has made it possible to complete 375 projects worth $22.6 million, thanks to the commitment of individuals, community organizations and many partners whose actions have contributed to the development and protection of the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863013">This plan will allow us to pursue the excellent partnership we have created with the Quebec government and with our other partners in order to provide sound information based on the expertise of our scientists. It will allow us to get decision-makers and people who use the St. Lawrence involved in order to ensure the health of the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863014"> The St. Lawrence River is vital to our development and has played an important part in our history and our daily lives. I live in Lévis, where we have the Quebec City-Lévis ferry, the St. Lawrence cruises, port activity and sailing activities. This summer and in the next few years, Quebec City will be hosting important events such as the Rendez-vous naval de Québec—there will be a number of vessels—and competitions will take place in Quebec City and the St. Lawrence corridor, with the tall ships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863015">Therefore it is our duty to leave a healthy St. Lawrence River to future generations so they can have the best possible economy and environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863016">Before concluding, I would simply like to remind members that the work carried out by our <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> has been noticed internationally. In fact, the International Institute for Sustainable Development has recognized that Canada is well on its way to reaching its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863017">The <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> has made massive investments in Parks Canada, including through the economic action plan. We have a <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> who has actively committed to increasing protected areas throughout the country in order to protect our ecosystems. Our minister keeps in direct contact with major greenhouse gas emitters in order to ensure that Canada, in co-operation with the provinces, can meet its targets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863024">When I look at the data, I am a bit surprised. We have an effective plan with which we have achieved a third of our targets. However, I see that, in the past decade, under the Liberals, carbon dioxide emissions in Canada increased by 28.4%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863025">I would like to know how the minister did it. Under the Liberals, our country had completely lost control of our carbon dioxide emissions.

              <ParaText id="2863026">Could the minister talk about the measures that cover the transportation industry, the source of a quarter of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions?

We are firmly committed to achieving this target. We were about a quarter of the way to achieving that target about a year ago. We have progressed significantly since then. I should have some new numbers in the weeks ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863029">What is important is with our sector by sector strategy we are systematically addressing all major sources of emissions. As I have reminded the House this evening, we have already addressed transportation, which contributes about a quarter of our annual greenhouse gas emissions. New regulations are about to be presented with regard to the coal-fired electricity sector. We are consulting with oil and gas, including the oil sands. We will move on to talk to other major emitters: cement, steel, buildings, both commercial and residential, as we work our way around the pie chart and closer to achieving our target of a 17% reduction by 2020. </ParaText>

Our freshwater resources are vital sources of safe drinking water, key transportation routes and are the basis of our freshwater fisheries, as well as important for tourism recreation. Our lakes and rivers simply are what makes Canada Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863093">Our government has recognized that we have a tremendous responsibility to ensure our freshwater resources are protected. We understand that there are significant pressures affecting the health of some of our freshwater. We are addressing those challenges by taking concrete and measurable actions to restore and protect nationally significant bodies of freshwater, such as the Great Lakes, Lake Simcoe and, in my own backyard, Lake Winnipeg.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863098">The Great Lakes and the major rivers that connect them constitute the world's largest freshwater system and they are fundamental to the well-being of millions of Canadians. This region supports Canada's highest concentration of industry, nearly 25% of total Canadian agricultural production, a commercial and recreational fishery that has been estimated to be worth about $7 billion and a transportation corridor with shipping from all over the world. The Great Lakes provide the foundations for billions of dollars in economic activity, sustain a rich a variety of plants and animals and are a direct source of high quality drinking water for one-fourth of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863099">The Government of Canada has made significant investments in the Great Lakes, resulting in important gains for both the environment and human health. Our investments include over $538 million since 2007 to enhance municipal waste water treatment infrastructure, which directly improves water quality within the Great Lakes. We provided $48.9 million from 2008 to 2016 to accelerate the remediation of contaminated sediment in the Great Lakes and the renewal of the Great Lakes action plan in budget 2010. We are committing $8 million per year on an ongoing basis to support the remediation of Great Lakes areas of concern, locations that have been identified as experiencing environmental degradation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863100">Budget 2011 provided new funding of $5 million over two years to improve nearshore water and ecosystem health and better address the phosphorous issues in the Great Lakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863101">These significant investments in the Great Lakes are resulting in important environmental gains but more work needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863102">To that end, the Governments of Canada and the United States are in the process of finalizing amendments to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Since 1972, this agreement has guided the efforts of both countries by aligning objectives and coordinating action across multiple jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863103">The agreement has been an international example of effective management of shared water resources and was instrumental in reversing eutrophication issues in the late 1970s and 1980s, significantly reducing persistent toxic substances in the ecosystem and cleaning up contaminated areas within the Great Lakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863104">The agreement and the leading edge work it produced has also served as a powerful driver for developing and reforming environmental laws and policies within the United States and Canada, including our own Canadian Environmental Protection Act, a key tool in delivering the highest level of environmental quality for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="20">(2320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863105">An amended Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement would allow our government to comprehensively address current problems in the Great Lakes, including cumulative stresses acting on the nearshore environment, aquatic invasive species, habitats and species loss and climate change impacts, and move quickly to prevent future problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863106">For over 40 years, the Government of Canada has worked in co-operation with the Province of Ontario on Great Lakes aquatic ecosystem health through a series of Canada-Ontario agreements respecting the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. The Canada-Ontario agreement establishes a domestic plan of concrete actions that the federal and provincial governments will undertake to implement the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement to restore, protect and conserve the Great Lakes. We anticipate a new Canada-Ontario agreement later this year that will align with the newly amended Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863107">The Government of Canada is also working to restore, protect and conserve water quality and ecosystem health in other bodies of water, such as Lake Simcoe in Ontario. Located north of Toronto, the lake is a major recreation area generating millions of dollars a year in tourism revenue. It lies in a major agricultural area and supplies drinking water to eight municipalities. The lake has been suffering some stress due to phosphorous inputs and eutrophication. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863108">The health of Lake Simcoe has been declining for many years. Since 2008, the Government of Canada's $30 million Lake Simcoe cleanup fund has supported initiatives to preserve and protect the environment of Lake Simcoe and has allowed Canadians to live, work and play near Lake Simcoe to enjoy the benefits of a cleaner lake. I am proud to say that our government has supported, which I find unbelievable, approximately 160 local projects so far, including over 90 habitat and non-point source pollution improvement projects to restore and preserve the health of Lake Simcoe. That is what I call delivering real environmental results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863109">Recognizing the success of this program, budget 2012 continues to provide new investments to ensure we are able to work together with local partners toward improving the water quality and ecosystem health of Lake Simcoe and deliver on our commitment to clean water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863110">The Government of Canada is also taking action on Lake Winnipeg to restore its ecological integrity, reduce blue-green algae blooms, ensure fewer beach closings and ensure continuation of a vibrant and sustainable fishery. Lake Winnipeg is the sixth largest freshwater lake in North America and supports a $50 million per year freshwater fishery and a $110 million per year tourism industry. The lake is situated in and receives inputs from a drainage basin of almost one million square kilometres that encompasses four provinces and four U.S. states. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863111">Beginning in 2008, the Government of Canada committed $17.7 million over four years to work with our provincial partners to clean up Lake Winnipeg through the Lake Winnipeg basin initiative, again delivering real environmental results. This initiative has contributed to cleaning up the lake and supporting science. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863112">Despite the work done to date, Lake Winnipeg continues to experience poor water quality due to excess nutrient loading from multiple local and transboundary sources. The excess nutrient load causes increasingly large, frequent and potentially toxic algal blooms. Without a reduction in nutrient inputs, primarily phosphorous, deterioration in the lake's water quality will continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863113">Budget 2012 also provides renewed funding for Lake Winnipeg to continue the important work begun in 2007, which will enable us to work with partners to take action to resolve problems that threaten this great resource. Through our work on Lake Winnipeg, Lake Simcoe and the Great Lakes, the Government of Canada is ensuring clean freshwater for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863114">We will continue to deliver on that commitment through our government's investments in research, monitoring, leading edge science, partnerships with other jurisdictions and targeted actions to clean up problems of the past. We hope to prevent future problems because Canada's freshwater resources are not only a source of immense pride for our country but are vital to supporting our environment, our economy and our society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863115">I cannot emphasize enough that this government provides resources to deliver real and tangible environmental results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863116">I have questions for the minister. I was wondering if the minister could please explain and elaborate on what our government is doing to protect the Great Lakes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863121">Mr. Chair, I had the opportunity of being at Lake Simcoe this year to announce further funding for the protection of this great region. Lake Simcoe has an enormous impact on the regional economy. We have several members of our government who are keenly interested in ensuring that this water basin maintains its health. To support that, the Government of Canada's $30 million Lake Simcoe cleanup fund has supported initiatives designed to preserve and protect the environment of Lake Simcoe, supporting 160 local projects since 2008 and leveraging another 600 restoration projects with third party agreements. This means that local community groups are working with government to partner and ensure the health of this ecosystem. However, the NDP voted against this funding as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863122">Through the Lake Winnipeg basin initiative, Canada committed $17.7 million over four years, from 2008 to 2012, to clean up Lake Winnipeg, aiming to reduce blue-green algae blooms, ensure fewer beach closings, keep in place a sustainable fishery, provide a clean lake for recreation and restore the ecological integrity of the lake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863123"> Again, we are recognizing a problem that is happening in one of our water basins, investing to support it, working with community groups to come up with real action, but the NDP voted against that.</ParaText>

They deliver on the ground programs and projects through local clubs and deliver real environmental results. In fact, this is one conservation group that actually asks to pay tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863125"> In the minister's department there is a section called Wildlife Habitat Canada, which is funded by the hunting licences that we migratory bird hunters have to buy. I am a very strong supporter of this agency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863128"> My colleague talked about organizations which we partner with, including Ducks Unlimited. We have heard from Ducks Unlimited in committee several times over the last few weeks, with regard to the development of a national conservation plan. There is the NCC. These are all groups, including our fisher and angler communities, that work to preserve the landscape in a working landscape concept. This means they understand the principle of using land for productivity, while ensuring conservation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863129">Some of the things we have done to support meaningful environmental protection in our country since 2006, which my colleagues have voted against, include: nearly $200 million to help address the health and environmental risks posed by dangerous chemicals through the chemical management plan; $100 million to support clean energy generation in Canada's forest sector through the next generation renewable power initiative; $97 million to develop and promote clean energy technologies; and $86 million to support clean energy actions, this year. I hope they will support those in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863181">Mr. Chair, I want to thank you for allowing me the time to talk about the main estimates. I am actually quite excited about one aspect of the government's plans and priorities for the next year in Environment Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863182">The issue I want to bring to the attention of members in the House is a project that I have been working on, along with a number of other people, which is the establishment of a new national urban park in the Rouge Valley in Toronto. This is a very exciting project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863183">This project is really an example of citizens coming together to spur the government to action. This is something that was started by the Honourable Pauline Browes, who was a minister in the government of Brian Mulroney in the late 1980s and represented Scarborough in this Parliament. She and people like Glenn De Baeremaeker, a City of Toronto councillor, and other interested stakeholders who served in the City of Toronto, in the town of Markham and in the greater Toronto region have worked for the better part of 20 years to fight to preserve a very important watershed in southern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863184">I was asked to sit as the federal government's representative on the Rouge Park Alliance some five years or so ago. <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister Flaherty</Affiliation> asked me if I would sit on that group, representing the government. I did so without really knowing a lot about this particular project. When I started to get involved with the alliance, I realized what a gem we had there in the eastern part of the GTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863185">What also struck me was that literally thousands of ordinary Canadians had given up their time, effort and money to push the governments, both federally and provincially, to work towards the establishment of this park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863186">Many people had spent the better part of two decades working on this project. When I joined it, I sought to educate myself about it under the leadership of Alan Wells , who was then and is now the chair of the alliance. He was appointed by the Government of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863187"> We decided that after 20 years of a very ad hoc governance arrangement, we really needed to come forward with a new governance structure for the park, a new budget, a new vision, so we engaged in a year and a half of consultations with various stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, including the federal, provincial and municipal governments and environmental NGOs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863188">What we ended up with was a report that we came forward with in the early part of 2010. The report called for the creation of a national park in the Rouge Valley. The report was unanimously adopted by all of the various stakeholders—municipal and provincial, environmental and non-environmental—involved with this initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863189">We presented the findings to the federal government in early 2010, and we started to lobby the government and the then Minister of the Environment, <Affiliation DbId="128695" Type="4">Minister Prentice</Affiliation>, to seek action, to see if the government would take the report's recommendations and work toward the establishment of this park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863190">I remember very vividly the day Minister Kent was appointed to the federal cabinet as Minister of the Environment. I was in a hotel room when I managed to get hold of him. We had an hour-long chat over the telephone about this initiative. I think it was in late January or early February of 2011. We had a long and sincere chat about this initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863191">I said to him at the time that this was really the make or break moment for the park. I really felt that if the government did not move forward with this initiative, it was going to fall apart, and all the work that we had done would have been for naught.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863192">I was delighted that <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister Kent</Affiliation> took it upon himself to really push this initiative. We had an election about five months later, and it was in the party's election commitment to work towards the establishment of this park. Then, after the election, in the Speech from the Throne in 2011, the government reaffirmed its commitment to establish this park.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="50">(2350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863193">Last fall, a mere several months later, Parks Canada, with Alan Latourelle, initiated the consultations that began on the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto, where we invited a wide range of stakeholders, including, I might add, a member of the New Democratic caucus from Scarborough who joined us for this consultation. She participated for the whole day in those consultations, and that marked the start of the process that we are now in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863194">I am very excited about this because it is important for two reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863195">The first reason is that it is ecologically important. We have protected large swaths of Canada's north and the boreal forest zone of the High Arctic. I was in Auyuittuq National Park on my own time and my own dime. A couple of years ago I hiked up the Weasel River some 19 kilometres. Never did I think that these moraines would be so difficult to climb. I thought I could do five kilometres an hour, but I think it took me an hour a kilometre to scramble up these moraines. It was a memorable trip. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863196">We have protected the High Arctic. We have protected the rain forest in the Pacific Rim National Park. We have protected marine areas, whether off the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario or off the Pacific or Atlantic coasts. We have protected Gros Morne National Park. We have protected large swaths of Canada's biodiversity, but the most intense biodiversity in Canada that we have not protected on a large scale is the Carolinian forest zone, found only in southern Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863197">This zone lies to the west of Toronto. If one were to draw a line between Toronto and Stratford, everything south of that is the Carolinian forest zone, and we have not protected a big chunk of it. It is the most dense biosphere in the country. This park would expand the federal protection of that very important biosphere, the eastern deciduous forest zone known as the Carolinian forest zone. That is the first reason this is such an important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863198">The second reason is that many of us will never go to Canada's national parks. The fact of the matter is that most of Canada's national parks are in very remote areas, especially for people who are living in the St. Lawrence lowlands. They are far away and cost thousands and thousands of dollars to get to. To do a canoe trip in Nahanni would cost $,5000 or $6,000 just for a week or two up there. The same goes for many of Canada's national parks, yet in southern Ontario, in the GTA, we have some 8 million Canadians, and in the next 20 years we are going to have a 50% increase in that population, to some 12 million Canadians who would live in what is now called the Golden Horseshoe. Many of these Canadians are new Canadians and have never accessed the great outdoors. Many have never had access to our national park system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863199">We all know the challenge in these last three years with the decline in the global economy and the challenge of making our national park system accessible. That is why this is such an important initiative. It would give access, a gateway, to our national park system to some eight million Canadians, many of whom are new Canadians living in the greater Toronto area. We will make this national park system accessible right on their back doorstep with a quick hop on the rapid transit system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863200">I want to thank Parks Canada, the minister, Catherine Grenier and Andy Campbell for their continued work on this initiative. I also want to recognize members of the Rouge Park Alliance for their tireless diligence. People have contributed over 20 years of volunteerism and hard work to this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863201"> I am very excited about the department and agency's plans and priorities for this initiative. I am going out on a limb here, but I think this could become the most visited national park in our national park system once it is created and up and running. This is a tremendous initiative that will create a new opportunity for Canadians to access the great outdoors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863202">I will finish on this final note of informing members of this committee why this is an interesting project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863203"> We have never created a park in an urban setting. This park will be 10 to 15 times the size of Central Park. It will far outstrip Stanley Park in Vancouver in terms of size, and it is right in the heart of the city of Toronto, in the town of Markham. Because of that, we are going to create a new type of national park with this initiative called a near-urban national park, or an urban national park. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="55">(2355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863204">This will allow Parks Canada to develop expertise in this kind of set-up for parks that are near urban areas. This will be a precedent-setting park that may expand its initiatives in the Gatineau, across the river from Ottawa here, and in other large metropolitan regions, whether they be Montreal or Vancouver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863205">I want to thank the minister for this initiative. I will just ask a quick question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863206">A lot of services have been reduced in existing areas at Parks Canada. My question for the minister is: Why is Parks Canada working on creating new national parks and national marine conservation areas, while at the same time it is reducing the budget in other areas of Parks Canada?</ParaText>

This brings Parks Canada's protected areas network to 427,000 square kilometres, which represents a 54% increase. I would advise the House that we are not stopping here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863210">Mr. Chair, when we did the report for the Rouge Park Alliance that recommended the creation of the national urban park for the Rouge Valley, the alliance's estimate of the costs associated with this park, which some members have been wondering about, was that it would require $40 million to $50 million in capital costs over a 10-year period and about $4 million to $5 million in ongoing annual operating costs. I just put that on the record. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863211">It is not in these main estimates, but the government did reaffirm its commitment to the establishment of this park. Obviously we cannot come up with numbers for the fiscal framework in the main estimates until we have gone through the consultation process, determined the boundaries for the new park, developed an MC to bring to cabinet, got the approvals for the fiscal framework and so on. I just put that out as a point of information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863212">Perhaps the minister would comment on the Rouge Park Alliance's estimates for both the $40 million to $50 million in capital costs for a 10-year period and the $4 million to $5 million in ongoing operating annual costs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863271">Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this committee of the whole this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863272">Clean air is important to all Canadians. When our air is compromised by pollution, our health pays the price. When our government came into office in 2006, clean air was and remains a top priority. Air pollution is linked to a wide variety of health concerns, including asthma and cardiovascular disease. Air pollution can lead to premature death, increased hospital admissions, more emergency room visits and higher rates of worker absenteeism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863273">Budget 2011 alone provided almost $870 million in renewed funding for the clean air regulatory agenda to ensure that we can deliver on our commitments and priorities on air quality. Because of Canada's diverse geography and types of industrial development, pollution levels and the sources of air pollution vary across the country. Environment Canada is taking steps that will make an impact on air pollution across the country. These include regulations to reduce emissions from vehicles and engines, the gradual phase-out of coal-fired electricity generation and regulations to reduce emissions from certain consumer and commercial products that contain harmful elements in large quantities. The government is also working hard with the provinces and industrial stakeholders on a new, comprehensive, nationwide air quality management system to improve air quality across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863274">The air quality management system has been developed over the past three years with the unprecedented collaboration of the federal, provincial and territorial governments; industry; and a broad range of other stakeholders. As part of the air quality management system, Canadian ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and ground-level ozone more stringent than the existing Canada-wide standards have been developed. The objective of these national standards is to achieve a level of air quality that provides a measurable improvement in the health of Canadians. These standards will also be used by provinces and territories to manage air quality at the regional and local levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863275"> In addition to national efforts to improve air quality within Canada, the Government of Canada is taking steps internationally to reduce the cross-border flow of air pollution and its impacts. Developing a clearer national framework on air pollution through the air quality management system will provide a strong basis for further engagement with the United States on transboundary airflow issues, including the Canada–U.S. air quality agreement. Cooperation between Canada and the United States on air quality is ongoing under the air quality agreement, and also under the mandate of the Canada-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation Council. Over 20 years ago, scientists concluded that transboundary movement of air pollution from industrial activities between Canada and the United States resulted in acid rain causing smog and serious damage to our environment. Action was taken to establish a joint agreement to address the issue. Following 20 years of cooperation between Canada and the U.S., emissions causing acid rain have been cut in half and emissions causing smog have been cut by one-third in the region covered under the agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863276">In Canada as a whole, emissions of the key pollutants that contribute to smog, acid rain and poor air quality have seen significant declines since 1990. For example, emissions of sulphur oxides declined by about 54%, mainly due to reductions from base-metal smelters which were down 72% and fossil-fuel fired electricity-generating utilities which decreased by 45%. Since the addition of the ozone annex to the Canada–U.S. air quality agreement in 2000, Canada has also reduced emissions to nitrogen oxide by one-third in southern and central Ontario and southern Quebec. Environment Canada's initiatives have also resulted in a 34% reduction in emissions of particulate matter which is linked to respiratory illness such as chronic bronchitis and asthma as well as cardiac illness and premature death.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="20">(2420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863277">However, more effort on particulate matter is required, and this government is acting. Environment Canada is working with the U.S. on the expansion of the Canada-U.S. air quality agreement to address transboundary particulate matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863278">Environment Canada is also working with international partners under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to address transboundary air pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863279">In just the past few weeks, Canada played a constructive role in finalizing historic amendments to the 1999 Gothenburg protocol adopted in Geneva on May 4. This protocol will result in further global reductions of air pollution by 2020. The revised Gothenburg protocol is also noteworthy on air pollution policy because it is the first international treaty to include a short-lived climate pollutant, black carbon, as a component of particulate matter. Black carbon is both an air pollutant and a major contributor to global warming. By taking action to reduce black carbon emissions, we fight air pollution and climate change at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863280">This government is proud of its achievements in reducing air pollution emissions. We are committing significant funding resources to continue the work. Again, progress has been achieved domestically, with close collaboration among this government and the provinces and territories and also bilaterally, by way of our ongoing work with the U.S. to reduce cross-border air pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863281">This government has also worked constructively with our partners in Europe and the U.S. to finalize and see adopted the revised Gothenburg protocol.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863282">This issue is of the utmost importance to the people of <Affiliation DbId="170092" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>, and to all Canadians. This government will continue to address Canada's air quality issues today and in the future, to ensure that future generations can breathe easier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863283">I do have a few questions for the minister. My first question, through you, Mr. Chair, for the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> is with regard to the current state of air quality compared with other countries.</ParaText>

As I have explained in the House any number of times, our sector by sector regulatory approach started with transportation, which contributes fully one-quarter of Canada's annual greenhouse gas emissions. We are about to finalize the coal-fired electricity sector regulations in the next few weeks. We are in the consultation process with oil and gas, both conventional and the oil sands. We will continue to work our way around that pie chart.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863356">Although Environment Canada's strong regulatory performance goes uncontested given these realities, it is necessary for the department to aim for progressively higher levels of regulatory excellence. Changes to the regulatory processes will be a key component in enabling the department to achieve its goals for all Canadians. To this end, the department's next steps in improving regulatory measures involves streamlining and increasing the efficiency and transparency of its regulatory processes so they can be more efficient and effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863357">While these are significant aims, there are broader, practical considerations as well, especially given the impact that environmental rules and standards have on our economy. We have to uphold these high standards at the same time as we ensure Canadian businesses hold their own in an intensely competitive global marketplace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863358">Given the key role that first-class environmental regulations play in a well-functioning economy, it is easy to understand why striving for regulatory excellence is so important. The commitment to regulatory excellence is perhaps best demonstrated through the internationally recognized chemicals management plan. Launched in 2006 as a combined effort of Environment Canada and Health Canada, the chemicals management plan has elevated Canada to the position of world leader in addressing threats to the safety and security of Canadians for new and existing chemical substances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863359">Many of the chemicals reviewed under the chemicals management plan are pervasive in the everyday lives of Canadians. They range from chemicals used in various industrial sectors, including fuels, energy, pulp and paper, household products, children's toys and in food. Bisphenol A is a well-known example. Here is a case where a comprehensive series of measures have been put in place starting with banning its use in baby bottles. This was followed by controls to limit the release of industrial effluents to water and the implementation to research and monitoring programs to determine if further action is required. In addition, the chemicals management plan is a predictable science-based regime that provides regulatory certainty for business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863360">Canada is also using its research and monitoring data together with our regulatory experience to provide international leadership in chemicals management. For example, last summer, Canada hosted the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant in Halifax. That brought together several hundred researchers from around the world and showcased the results of Canada's work in this field. In particular, this science has identified that over 95% of mercury, a potent neurotoxin that is particularly harmful to pregnant women and children, is coming from other countries and accumulating in Canada's north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863361">Canada's science is informing UN negotiations for a mercury treaty aimed toward limiting atmospheric emissions from these countries and, thus, protecting Canadians and our environment. It is also informing the international community on the progress that has been made in managing persistent organic pollutants, such as PCBs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863362">Together, over the past five years, Environment Canada and Health Canada have made great strides in a wide range of chemical risk assessments, regulatory activities, monitoring and research. That work must and will proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863363">In 2011, the government announced $500 million over five years to ensure the significant work on chemicals, which we began back in 2006, continues at full speed. We have made solid progress under the chemicals management plan in addressing a significant portion of the chemicals that are believed to be in commerce and that have been identified as having potential risks to human health or the environment. We have now worked through the assessment of about 1,100 chemicals on that list and will tackle close to 1,500 over the next five years. We will also ensure that new harmful chemicals do not enter the Canadian market.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="50">(2450)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863364">The chemicals management plan exemplifies many of the hallmarks of a world-class regulatory system. It is a transparent regulatory program that provides for stakeholder participation and is responsive to the growing body of new science in this field. Last year, for example, stakeholders asked for reconsideration of one of our regulatory decisions on the basis of new science. A board of review was established composed of a panel of experts in this area and they examined new information, including studies carried out by Environment Canada. The board found that the substance did not pose a danger to the environment and, as such, the department was able to conclude that the substance was not toxic and regulatory control measures were not required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863365">Another strength of the chemicals management plan is the government's ongoing commitment to consult and share information with stakeholders and the public at key stages throughout the regulatory process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863366">Since 2006, about $400 million have been spent by Environment Canada and Health Canada to ensure that the health of Canadians and their environment is protected, which is a key priority. We are determined to ensure that existing chemicals used in our homes, businesses and public spaces are properly managed and that the risks to Canadians are minimized. We are equally determined to keep close tabs on any and all new chemicals that enter the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863367">There is no question that protecting the health of Canadians and their environment is a key priority. This priority is clearly reflected through the funding of the next phases of the chemical management plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863368">Moving forward, I am confident that Environment Canada and the entire department will continue to regulate in a manner that is evidence-based, efficient, effective, transparent and adaptable, firmly establishing itself as a world-class regulator.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863369">I have a couple of questions for the parliamentary secretary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863370">First, how can the government say that it is a world leader in chemicals management when Canadians and the environment are still exposed to harmful chemicals?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863374">Mr. Chair, the parliamentary secretary mentioned Lake Winnipeg and its south basin is in my riding of Selkirk—Interlake. This has been one initiative that I have been so pleased was undertaken by our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863375"> Over the past four years, Environment Canada has invested $18 million in research to look at things like nutrient loads and ways to control agricultural run-off and to monitor and improve municipal waste water treatment right through the entire basin. The basin consists of four provinces and four U.S. states. It has been incredible to have the participation of stakeholders throughout the Lake Winnipeg basin. They have contributed to the knowledge and the reduction of nutrient loads going into Lake Winnipeg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863376">I, my kids and my family love to swim in Lake Winnipeg. We have some beautiful beaches in the south basin and the last thing we want to see is algae blooms. The last thing we want to see is having high E. coli counts and beach closures because of these nutrient loads that occur from time to time. We need to work closely with stakeholders to reduce those nutrients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863377">The $18 million through Environment Canada and targeted through research within the department and also working along with academics throughout the basin have provided a significant benefit long term. Part of the Lake Winnipeg basin initiative also consisted of the Lake Winnipeg stewardship fund and that component was almost $4 million in funding provided to community stakeholder groups that did different types of projects. One that was particularly successful, and is still running to this day, was the one that was undertaken by the Lake Winnipeg south basin mayors and reeves. They introduced a lake-friendly program to label products that were lake friendly, essentially that they were low in phosphates and nitrates and that they were safe to use if they ever ended up in the lake through the watershed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863378">In watching the debate earlier today, I understand there were a number of members who already spoke to the benefits of protecting Lake Winnipeg since it acted as the reservoir for the entire southern Prairies and the northern great plains of the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863379">The parliamentary secretary is extremely familiar with Lake Winnipeg. Could she speak of her experience and her ideas and suggestions on how this program has worked and how it may continue into the future?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863380">Mr. Chair, my colleague's question is well-informed. He is quite correct. I have a great fondness in my heart for Lake Winnipeg, having grown up spending countless summer nights on that lake. It is dear to many people in the prairie provinces. However, it is important to note as well that the Lake Winnipeg basin's watershed exceeds over one million square kilometres. As my colleague mentioned, it also incorporates part of the northern U.S. states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863381">Therefore, it is particularly important that we continue the work we do as a government to monitor water quality in the major rivers that contribute nutrients to Lake Winnipeg, including the Red, Pembina and Saskatchewan Rivers. As has been mentioned already tonight, we are also monitoring for biological effects and changes along the southern shoreline of the lake and following nutrient transport from distributed sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863382">The one thing I want to highlight in my colleague's comments is the ongoing partnership that our government has with local conservation groups, local research teams and industry groups to get to a point where we have policy in place that balances that need to use the landscape to produce agriculture with that environmental protection component. Our investments into this area are so important and vital. As a former Manitoban, this is really important to the people of that province and the watershed basin. We hope we will continue with those measures well into the future.</ParaText>

He has made an error tonight and in previous declarations in the House accusing environmental charitable organizations of criminal activity. He has the opportunity to withdraw and retract. We certainly hope that he will take that opportunity tonight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="2863447">I want to speak about our plan for oil sands monitoring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863448">Over the last year, Canada has weathered economic storms, and few other countries in the world have succeeded in the same way we have. Oil sands and oil sands development have had an important part to play in this. They are an extremely important resource for Canada and a key driver of our economic development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863449">Our country's oil reserves, 97% of which are found in the oil sands, are third only to major producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela in proven national oil supplies. The oil sands sector accounts for 2% of our GDP and accounted for more than $17 billion in capital investment in 2010. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863450">Equally important to this government is that the oil sands are developed in an environmentally responsible way. While the leader of the opposition will travel across this country and try to tell Canadians it is okay to slander people in one region, who work in one sector, against people in another, Canadians know different. They know we are united under one banner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863451">We are united under an economy that provides jobs and opportunity for Canadians in an equal way. This equality, this unity, is something our government stands for, and as a government member, I am certainly proud to stand here tonight and talk about responsible resource development that will ensure jobs and economic growth for years to come for this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863452">The sustainable development of Canada's oil sands will require discipline, focus and co-operation to protect the environment while realizing the full positive potential for all Canadians. That is exactly what our government is committed to doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863453">Last July, we released our integrated environment monitoring plan for the oil sands, a plan that was developed in partnership with leading environmental scientists from across Canada. It outlined the elements needed for a world-class monitoring program with a comprehensive approach that covers water, air and biodiversity. Then in February, we released a joint implementation plan describing how we would work with the Government of Alberta and industry, in consultation with other key stakeholders, to put a world-class monitoring program in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863454"> Rather than slander the sector, we worked with the stakeholders, we worked with industry and we worked with the communities to put together a plan that would ensure this monitoring system was put in place in a sustainable way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863455">This plan will make Canada's oil sands monitoring among the best in the world. It optimizes existing provincial and federal environmental monitoring for water, air and biodiversity and is being carried out in an efficient manner as we utilize infrastructure that is in currently place. Monitoring will be comprehensive and integrated. We will seek advice from all stakeholders as we deliver on this plan. Implementation will be tracked through annual progress reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863456">This new program will be subject to external scientific peer review at the end of the three-year implementation, and periodically thereafter. Therefore, in spite of what the opposition will say, there will be external peer review as part of this process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863457">This will ensure that we build and maintain one of the best environmental monitoring systems anywhere in the world. This is a democratic free country where we have oil reserves that are under a democratic government with a world-class oil sands monitoring program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863458">This collaboration and informed discussion are the cornerstones to success for an undertaking as complex and as important as the oil sands monitoring development project. We will make the system highly transparent. We will ensure that scientific data that is collected from our monitoring and analysis is publicly available with common quality assurance practices in place. As we move forward with the implementation of this program, we will continue to engage stakeholders, so they are informed each step of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863459">The governments of both Canada and Alberta have already committed significant resources to environmental monitoring. Industry has indicated it is willing to provide the additional funding required to implement the new monitoring activities and is working with the two governments to establish sustainable funding arrangements for the program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863460">Our plan for the oil sands monitoring is a direct result of the fact that this government listened and acted. We listened to environmental monitoring experts when they raised concerns about possible environmental impacts of the oil sands. We acted. We listened to an environmental advisory panel that recommended we develop a world-class, scientifically credible and trusted monitoring reporting system, which the Environment Commissioner noted as such in committee testimony.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="25" Mn="20">(2520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="2863461">We listened to Canadians who support the environmentally responsible development of this economic resource. We look forward to the next 12 months as our government is keenly interested in striking the right balance between economic renewal and environmental protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863462">As we close off this hearing tonight, I think it is really important to note that our government is not interested in rhetoric or inflaming different regions against each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863463">We want to ensure that our country is prosperous. We have seen the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs since 2009. We have a plan to ensure that economic growth is created, and the energy sector is part of that. We are balancing that with a firm environmental stewardship plan that is funded in this budget. We have all sorts of excellent metrics in place through the oil sands monitoring program. We need to ensure that the rhetoric that is put in place by the NDP is not something that Canadians take to heart. This is about the sustainable development of our energy sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863464">As an Albertan and as a Canadian, I certainly hope that my constituents' voices and the voices of all Canadians who are impacted by this important sector are listened to by the NDP and that the NDP will not continue this harmful, disuniting practice of pitting workers in one region against the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863465">When we look at the government's track record, millions of dollars have been invested into programs that have created positive environmental impacts. My colleagues tonight have talked about the Lake Winnipeg Basin and the local conservation groups that we are supporting. Right now we are travelling across the country in the environment committee, but the NDP is not talking about that, listening to Canadians and talking about how we can engage local conservation groups in creating a national conservation plan framework, something that we committed to in our throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863466">Instead of the Liberal Party that puts forward plans, grand international accords and sees greenhouse gas emissions rising, we are actually taking action. The most recent greenhouse gas emission trend report came forward. It showed that for the first time we are seeing economic growth in this country, and the stabilization of our greenhouse gas emissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="2863467">Listening to Canadians and industry and coming up with a plan that balances economic growth with environmental stewardship is something that is prudent, it is something that Canadians want and it is something that I am certainly proud to support. </ParaText>
