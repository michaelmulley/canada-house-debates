              <ParaText id="3167917"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act (administration, air and railway transportation and arbitration)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-52. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="3167918"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to support Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, the fair rail freight service act. I would also like to take a moment, since it is the first time this year that I have spoken in the House, to say that I wish everyone a great 2013 and look forward to passing great legislation, such as the act I am about to speak to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167919">First, I congratulate the <Affiliation DbId="170701" Type="96">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> for his tremendous work on this important file. I would also like to thank my colleagues, the former Minister of State for Transport, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170653" Type="2">Yellowhead</Affiliation>; the <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>; and the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> for their contributions and support. In addition, there were many more people who contributed to the legislation in order to make it the best legislation possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167920">Our Conservative government remains focused on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. The bill advances these priorities. It will help shippers maintain and grow their businesses, while ensuring that railways manage an efficient shipping network for everyone.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3167921">Canadian businesses count on a reliable rail transportation system.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3167922">With 70% of Canada's surface freight moving by train, railways are extremely important to the competitiveness of our economy. In 2010, Canada's major freight rail companies, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, served approximately 5,000 shippers and transported products to more than 10,000 destinations in North America and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167923">As my hon. colleagues know, our government launched the rail freight service review in 2008. Its objective was to address ongoing issues raised by shippers concerning the reliability and consistency of rail freight service. We appointed an independent three-member panel to conduct a comprehensive review of service issues and problems related to the rail system in Canada. The panel was asked to submit recommendations to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of rail shipping in order to support trade and economic growth. The panel held broad consultations across the country, hearing from both shippers' representatives and railways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167924">Their recommendations proposed the use of service agreements to increase the clarity and predictability of rail service. These agreements would clarify and clearly define the services that railways would provide and how shippers and railways interact. This proposal is based on the idea that by working together to develop these agreements, shippers and railways can improve the efficiency of the supply train rail freight system and in doing so enhance their contribution to Canada's competitiveness in the world economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167925">It is worth nothing that service agreements are a commercial tool, which our government believes is the best approach to improve the relationship between railways and shippers. We base this view on the fact that shippers and railways have always worked together commercially to define their private business dealings. Sometimes, however, shippers have been unable to negotiate contracts with railways to address service issues. Many shippers would like these agreements to know what service they can expect from the railways in order to manage their businesses and plan for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167926">On March 18, 2011, our government announced that it accepted the panel's commercial approach. In fact, we went beyond the recommendations. We put in place four key measures to improve the performance of the entire rail supply chain. First, we launched a facilitation process to bring together shippers and railways to negotiate a template service agreement and develop a process to resolve commercial disputes. This process focused on improving the private commercial relationship. This six-month facilitation, which was led by Mr. Jim Dinning, took place in 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167927">Second, we committed to table legislation to give shippers the right to service agreements with railways and to establish a process for obtaining an agreement if commercial negotiations fail. The fair rail freight service act would fulfill this commitment and give shippers the certainty that they would be able to obtain service contracts from the railways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167928">Third, we committed to establish a body of rail shippers to address logistics and develop standards to improve competitiveness. This group, known as a commodity supply chain table, will soon be established. Finally, we determined the need for an in-depth analysis of the grain supply chain to focus on issues that affect that sector and help identify potential solutions. This study is under way and should be completed soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167929">Together, these measures deliver on our Conservative government's commitment to ensure Canada has the rail system it needs, one that supports strong economic growth and long-term prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167930">It is worth noting why the legislation is needed. Canadians and Canadian businesses depend on rail to transport products to markets, both here in Canada and around the world, and it has to be done efficiently. We drafted the fair rail freight service act by working closely with and listening to the stakeholders involved. Shippers from a wide range of commodities and manufacturing sectors have told us what is important to them and what they need. Rail companies also explained the obligations they have to serve all shippers and the constraints they may face in carrying out their business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167931">This consultation helped us develop reasonable and intelligent legislation that would reflect the interests of both shippers and railways to meet the needs of the Canadian economy. This consultation also helped us develop reasonable and intelligent legislative proposals that reflect the interests of all the various stakeholders throughout our economy. The fair rail freight service act would create a strong incentive for issues around rail shipping to be settled through commercial means.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3167932">By requiring railways to offer agreements to shippers that requests them, the legislation would give the shipper the legal right to ask for a service level agreement. When a shipper requests an agreement, railways would have 30 days to offer one. The agreement would cover the terms of service that the railway and the customers would follow to move the shipper's goods. It could also include communication protocols and performance indicators, such as frequency of service, transit times and the number and type of cars, as elements that the rail companies would provide for their customers. This right to a service agreement would provide an effective tool for shippers to use in their discussions with railways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167933">In the event that negotiations for such an agreement fail, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> proposes a fair, speedy and inexpensive process to establish the service contract. The shipper would be able to go to the Canadian Transportation Agency to ask an arbiter to impose an agreement. To make such a request, the shipper would have to demonstrate that an effort had been made to reach an agreement commercially and that a 15-day notice had been served to the railway prior to the request for arbitration. The shipper would trigger the arbitration and frame the service issues to be addressed. The shipper and the railway would then each have the opportunity to provide submissions to the arbiter with their views in respect to the contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167934"> This process, however, would be an interest-based arbitration. This means the arbiter must consider the interests of both the shipper and the railway in establishing the service contract. The legislation would provide guidance to the arbiter on factors to consider when establishing a service contract, including the shipper's transportation requirements and the overall obligations of the railway to provide service to all shippers. The arbiter would have the flexibility to determine the right service contract for each individual case. Every shipper is different. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. In establishing a contract, the arbiter must consider the unique circumstances in each case. As a result, arbitration decisions would be fair and reasonable for both parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167935">Finally, the fair rail freight service act would provide a strong enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with arbitrated service contracts. It proposes the use of administrative monetary penalties to hold railways accountable for their service obligations, as defined in the arbitrated contracts. If a railway breaches its service obligations, the shipper would be able to complain to the Canadian Transportation Agency. If the agency confirms the violation, it could apply a penalty of up to $100,000 for each violation by the railway. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167936">Taken together, these measures of the right to service agreements, an efficient and speedy process when commercial negotiations fail and strong enforcement for arbitrated agreements would provide shippers with clarity, predictability and reliability when they need to grow their businesses and plan for the future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3167937">Our primary objective is to encourage better commercial relationships between railways and shippers. This legislation creates a very strong incentive for parties to settle agreements privately. In most cases, shippers and rail companies should be able to negotiate terms and agreements on their own. Second, over the last number of years rail companies have improved their service. Shippers themselves acknowledge that service has improved, and I would like to take a moment to congratulate the rail companies for this progress. Despite this fact, we must pass Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> to solidify and improve upon these gains to ensure that Canada's rail system is well positioned for the future. We must ensure the entire rail system in Canada will be able to support the expected increases in shipping, which is bound to occur due to our government's robust trade agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167938">As demonstrated by several new and developing free trade agreements, Canada is turning increasingly towards global trade to generate economic growth. This means we need efficient and effective transportation networks to give Canadian businesses a competitive advantage in the world markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167939">Before I conclude, I would also like to note that this legislation supports our government's responsible resource development agenda. In our efforts to modernize the grain sector, as we expand Canada's international exports, we need a rail transportation system that can move our resources to global markets efficiently and reliably.This legislation will make an enormous difference for our shippers in the resource sector. It will give grain farmers more predictable service as they work to sell their grain on the international market. It will give lumber mills more reliable service as they expand sales to Asia, and it will improve service to exporters of minerals, such as potash and coal. By improving the reliability and predictability of rail service, we help to strengthen Canada. We help strengthen Canadian companies and help increase Canadian companies' overseas sales.This legislation will create jobs, make Canada more competitive in the world economy and will make Canada a more attractive place to invest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167940">This proposed legislation offers a strong new tool to enhance the relationship between shippers and railways. Our Conservative government is proud to be taking this strong action to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the Canadian rail freight system. I am convinced that these proposed measures will help build an even stronger freight rail system and contribute to Canada's success in international trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167941">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> will promote growth, create jobs and build prosperity for all Canadians. I encourage all members in this House to vote in favour of this legislation and refer it to the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities without delay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167942">I would like to thank the many stakeholders, parliamentarians, and the shippers and rail companies, for their input in this process. We have come forward with legislation that I think has very broad support and will, as I have said many times already, make our country stronger. We live in the best country in the world, at the best time in history to be alive, and now we can ship our products more easily.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3167943">Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from across the way for his work on this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167944">The government is trying to establish some balance between the shippers and those who provide the products that drive our economy. Of all the goods that we move in this country, 70% go by rail. When looking at the details of what has been presented, the challenge for us is striking a balance when there is a problem. As the member well knows, there have been many years of problems with shippers not being able to get reliable service from the two large rail companies. One challenge is the way in which to resolve that dispute. I am curious as to the specific measures that the government has proposed to resolve disputes between the two. There is a bit of a power imbalance. When railcars do not show up as they have been promised, what recourse does the shipper actually have? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167945">The Coalition of Rail Shippers asked for a clear conflict or dispute resolution model. I do not see anything nearly as strong as what the shippers have asked for in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167946">My second question is very specific with regard to penalties. Last year CN alone turned a $2.7 billion profit. The maximum fine that the government has suggested under this legislation for a rail company to break a contract, such as promising to deliver a number of cars and simply not delivering them, is $100,000. Would that be incentive enough? Is the stick strong enough to change the behaviour of some of these rail companies that simply abuse the smaller shippers particularly in the country?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3167947">Mr. Speaker, it is correct that historically there have been challenges between railways and shippers. However, we also have to recognize that railways have improved in the last few years. This legislation is designed to ensure that shippers and railways respect each other and that we have a continuous chain of supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167948">If there is a problem there is a dispute mechanism, which would not be expensive. It would be done quickly and efficiently. I spoke to that in my remarks. The $100,000 a day fine is substantial with respect to the worth of CN or CP. They would not be in business long if they were to incur $100,000 a day, or per violation, too often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167949">It is still a competitive marketplace, and whomever provides the best service often wins in the end. This is a carrot and a stick approach. We look forward to railways and shippers working together. We are empowering shippers to be able to deal with the railways when they do not act appropriately. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3167952">As has been the case in the past, there have been 20 or 30 shippers who have had an issue with either CN or CP. If there were 20 at one time, it is my understanding that the fine would be $100,000 per day per complaint, which would be about $2 million a day. Could it be assumed that the shareholders of the two railways would be the most encouraging people to get that resolved sooner rather than later?</ParaText>

I would ask the minister, is that not exactly the problem here, that there is no competition? The shippers are captive and it is because of that captive shipper situation that legislation like this is in fact necessary. </ParaText>

Well, there is competition because there are at least two. It is a duopoly, for the most part. In that framework the railways have had a lot of power, absolutely, and the shippers have not had a lot of recourse. This fixes that problem and does it in a very collaborative manner. Shippers appreciate it, and if the railways do not appreciate it now, they soon will. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3167964">Mr. Speaker, it is with some pleasure that I rise today to address Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, which is perhaps not the best named act I have ever seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167965">The naming suggests that the problems shippers face across this country will now be solved. For those of us who come from the resource regions of this country, for years we have sat with shippers in forestry, farming, chemical and manufacturing industries as they have petitioned us, as members of Parliament, to do something about the situation. Recently the Coalition of Rail Shippers was asked and polled as to what its satisfaction was with the service they were receiving from the competitive duopoly, as described by the minister. Eighty per cent of those polled described serious and significant problems with their access to rail. That is not great.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167966">While Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is an improvement over the status quo, it has been five to six years promised and in the waiting. We see today what I can at best describe as a half measure. As the minister pointed out, as critical as rail service is to the Canadian economy, I think we could emphasize it even more. Seventy per cent of all the goods Canadians manufacture and sell in this country go by rail. An efficient economy, which we see with some of our European partners, would have an even higher percentage. It is the most efficient way to move things across borders and large tracts of land, which are two things we contend with here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167967">The minister described the near monopoly as a duopoly. I will take a moment on this, because I think it is important for Canadians to realize that if, for the Conservative government, the definition of a competitive marketplace is what we have in the rail shipping industry, we have a problem. Not only are there only two significant shippers available to those who are looking to move their product, but in many regions of the country there is only one. The line going to their freight yard, farm or lumber yard is controlled and wholly owned by one shipper. If one has a problem with that company, the status quo is terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167968">Members have seen it time and again. I can think of one particular mill in my riding in northwestern B.C., in Fort St. James, that has crawled through perhaps one of the toughest times the lumber market has ever seen since B.C. started shipping wood. It has managed to have a partnership with the union, get concessions on wages and have a great partnership with the community. It finally got to a viable place after years of struggle and against all odds. This is one of those communities for which it would be an understatement to say it relies on this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167969">At the end of the day it cannot get cars to move its products to market. It has product. It has someone willing to purchase that product. In between stands a rail company that does not seem to care that it made a contractual promise to deliver so many cars on such and such a date. The mill is waiting days and weeks for the cars to show up. The wood is stacked up in the yard and they cannot sell it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167970">The mill has turned to me as the member of Parliament. We approached the government with appeals and have said we need two things. One, we need both the carrot and the stick. We need a way for companies to deal with the shippers in a timely and cost-effective manner so that the conflict resolution model is not onerous and expensive. Again, smaller companies get penalized under this system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167971">CN and CP have had many years now of extraordinary profit. Since it was privatized under the Liberal government in the late 1990s, CN has gone on to see record profits and is now run primarily out of Texas. Most Canadians do not realize that, just because the cars have a Canadian flag on the side, where the cars actually go and to whom and when is not necessarily decided under Canadian interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167972">This legislation would allow the government to look to a company and say that even though it received $2.5 billion profit last year, we are going to really hit it hard by charging a $100,000 fine only if we find a serious and significant problem, only if the company looking to move its product is willing to pursue this all the way through the quasi-judicial process. At the end of the day maybe it will get fined. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167973">To CN and CP, these very large companies, it may be an easy equation to let them go through that dispute resolution, pursue it all the way through. It is more efficient and cost-saving for CN and CP to just ignore it. At the end of the day the worst case scenario is they would get a $100,000 fine.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3167974">That might just be the cost of doing business, because these companies could turn more profit in sending those cars somewhere else even though they have a signed contract. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167975">What is frustrating for a lot of these farmers is that they have contracts and they assume that those contracts mean something and then at the end of the day they do not, because they are beholden. The power imbalance is too great. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167976">The <Affiliation DbId="170706" Type="4">Minister of State for Transport</Affiliation> is attempting to readjust the power equation a bit. He mentioned as much in his answer to one of the questions. It has to be recognized that, in that key and critical relationship between those who make the goods and those who ship the goods, there is a disparity of power. We need to rebalance the tables a bit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167977">Often New Democrats talk about the underdogs, or people who have lost their jobs, or people who have fallen through the social safety net that the government continues to tear up. The underdogs we are talking about here are often major manufacturing outfits in Canada, very significant large farming interests. One would think they would have a lot of sway and power with the government, but for some reason the major rail companies that exist in this country, the duopoly, seem to be able to pull the string on the government and essentially get what they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167978">We waited six years. I know the minister said it was a nanosecond in Ottawa time or in geological time. I am not sure which, but five or six years is not a priority for a government. There have probably been 90 or 100 bills on crime and punishment from the current government. This is the first one on rail, and yet rail moves 70% of the product that we sell around the world. For the government to call it a priority, I would hate to see what the government thinks is not a priority because this legislation has been a while in the waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167979">Some people listening might think this is one of those rural-urban issues that only really affects those living in the resource sections of our country, those places that grow the trees and mine the rock and produce the energy and whatnot. Nothing could be more further from the fact. This is one of those issues that crosses over the interests of all Canadians, because if we are unable to move our products in a reasonable time to market either within a province, between provinces, across borders, to those international ports in Prince Rupert, Montreal, Halifax and beyond, it hurts everybody. When things are not reasonable and we cannot find a way to solve the problems of this power imbalance between these two companies centrally and all of the shippers involved, it hurts everybody. It hurts people right across the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167980">The government is seeking to get a balance. While this legislation is worthy of consideration at committee, we hope and pray that the government is open and interested in amendments to achieve the balance that the minister talked about in his comments. I come from communities that rely on that line. It is our connection to the world. It is our connection to a viable and secure economic future. When that line is disrupted for whatever reason—either through contracts that are not fulfilled by the rail companies or some geological disruption, to take some of the minister's line—it is absolutely critical to us because in today's economy, as competitive as it is, getting products to market in a timely and efficient manner is absolutely essential. We are competing with the world, and we can, but we need a good infrastructure system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167981">We used to have governments in Canada, of either more progressive or more conservative persuasions, that believed in the necessity to have that strong infrastructure. That was a role of government to pursue and enable the growth of the country. It was a Conservative government at the beginning that initiated the dream of a rail line across this country and drove that last spike. However since those times the present version of the Conservatives believes that the role of government is slightly different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167982">Here obviously what government must do is play referee on what we would argue is an unbalanced playing field. To this point, looking at a $100,000 fine for companies that are turning billions in profit perhaps suggests to the companies that the incentive is not there. When cars do not show up, when cars show up damaged and not useful and late and unable to ship the product that they are contracted for, most reasonable Canadians would say there is a dispute that would have to be filed through court. If it is the only company they can ship with, then how often are these companies going to go hard at it? Therefore they come through us. They come through MPs who represent these various constituencies and implore us to do something about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167983">This legislation is the government's attempt to do something about it. It has taken us a few steps. We insist that the government be open to taking us the rest of the way, so that at the end of the day we get it right this time, because we do not take on this issue very often in Parliament. Even though it may be a nanosecond for the government, this is years of frustration for industry; this is millions if not billions of dollars lost to the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

It also does it in a way that will hurt. It is up to $100,000 per violation, and it can go up day by day.

              <ParaText id="3167989">We do not want to see this legislation passed and have those same phone calls from those same farmers, same lumber companies and same mining companies saying that we passed this legislation, that the rails are not showing up, that they do not have their cars again and the dispute resolution system is going to cost them <I>x</I>, that it will take this long and it is not worth it and they are back to square one. We want to get this right, because again, we do not do it very often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167990">In terms of sending it to committee for that study, we think that is worthy. We hope the government will be open to all witnesses right across the spectrum and will actually listen to what is being said, so that if we need to strengthen this legislation, which we believe we do, then the government is actually open to that, which has not been past practice in this place with the government. Maybe there is a change of heart in the air.</ParaText>

In my opinion, Canada was built on the railway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3167999">If there is something that MPs, aside from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, do not talk about in this House very often, it is rail service, which is not necessarily seen as a priority. It is sad to see that, since the rise of the automobile, we talk less and less about the railway, on which Canada was built. It is a subject that is overlooked. From a transportation perspective, it is a big mistake to have allowed the railway to slowly be forgotten over the past 50 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168000">In Gatineau, our infrastructure takes a beating. Temperatures between -40<Sup>o</Sup>C in the winter and +40<Sup>o</Sup>C in the summer and a large number of heavy trucks and other vehicles damage our infrastructure. Our bridges and roads are constantly in need of repair, if they do not need to be replaced completely. This creates urban sprawl. It is difficult to deliver goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168001">I was shocked to see the statistics related to Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, given the tireless efforts of the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, who even introduced a private member's bill in this regard. People may not be aware that 70% of our goods are transported by rail. Of course, this is a whole sector of trade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168002">We have a government that prides itself on always being there for the economy and on having action plans. However, the government needs to take action rather than just talking about its action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168003">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="170706" Type="4">Minister of State for Transport</Affiliation> a question about the fact that this has taken five years. I would like to believe him and I find it quite amusing that the government refers to time in terms of what is happening here. Five years may go by quickly, as though it is only nanoseconds, but at some point, we should not be satisfied with this type of situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168004">One thing that frustrates me about this House is how long everything takes. When we know that the stakeholders are in agreement, when we know what the problem is, we have to stop playing petty politics and simply resolve the matter. That is why we were elected in the first place and why we are here in this House. Our job is to get these things done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168005">The leader of the second opposition party wants us to speed up the process. No one opposes the idea of speeding up the process as long as we know that everyone is willing to really listen to the complaints and suggestions. When we complain or make suggestions, it is not to play petty politics, but to ensure that, at the end of the process, we have legislation that makes sense and meets the needs of small businesses. It should be noted that this bill affects small and medium-sized businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168006"> Let us move away from the duopoly for a moment. I like the expression the minister of state used. This is a great idea for a new Parker Brothers game, but this game will not necessarily be fun for small and medium-sized businesses. It verges on what I would call forced negotiations. It is hard to negotiate when you have a sword hanging over your head.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168007">Considering that rail service is the driving force of our economy, there is a serious problem here. As parliamentarians, we must try to solve this problem regarding the balance of power. Indeed, this will serve small and medium-sized businesses, but at the end of the day, who will it really benefit? It will benefit our constituents, all Canadians who need these products and services, who need them to get to the right place safely and quickly.</ParaText>

The government does not even bother to find out whether the proposals have merit, which is seriously undemocratic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168010">For some members of the House, these are extremely important issues because they affect their constituents who have small and medium-sized businesses and who use rail services. These people have a few things to say about this issue. If we listen carefully we will see that they may have something worthwhile and important to say, which can benefit the debate. It does not help to always be so paranoid and think that people only ever speak to take down their opponent. On the contrary, sometimes they speak to enlighten the debate and improve the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168011">As the <Affiliation DbId="182412" Type="7">House Leader of the Official Opposition</Affiliation> so eloquently explained before me, the NDP plans on supporting the bill at second reading so that it can be sent to committee. I truly hope that the government will pay close attention and that enough expert witnesses will be invited to guide parliamentarians from all parties, so that they can draft a report on the committee's deliberations. Then, when we return to the House, the official opposition will be reasonably satisfied that this was taken seriously, that we were listened to and that the people who have a vested interest in this bill were heard. If that is the case, we will have the best bill possible to help the rail service, an industry that is fundamental to this great, beautiful country we call Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168309">Mr. Speaker, a question that has been raised in this debate—we listened to the minister speak earlier, just to remind people because we have had a bit of a break in the debate—is that this is an attempt to have some sort of balance of power between the shippers in Canada, which are seeking to move their products, of which 70% in Canada are moved by rail, and the railway companies, of which there are predominantly two. As the minister himself said, it is a competitive duopoly. In many parts of the country, it is not even a duopoly; it is a monopoly because there is only one service available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168310">So, in achieving some sort of balance of power between these two groups, the minister has suggested that there would be a tribunal of sorts, a way for dispute resolutions to be worked out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168311">However, when we look into details of the bill, we are now discovering that the dispute resolution mechanism, that way of solving those problems when the rail cars do not show up and the contracts are broken, will only be available to new contracts that are signed, as opposed to existing contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168312">I do not know how the minister can feel so confident that his bill would allow the Canadian economy, which relies on that freight being shipped, to progress in a better way if all those problems that have been existing for many years cannot get solved because the resolution is not offered to any contract that is already in existence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168313">I wonder if my friend could illuminate where that might be a problem in solving the real challenges we face.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3168325">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to participate in the debate this afternoon on the second reading of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, dealing with the issue of the level of railway services across the country. The House has been waiting for this legislation for several years. More importantly, shippers across the country have been waiting for this legislation for a very long time. I am sure we are all very happy that it is finally here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168326">The Liberal caucus intends to support Bill C-52 in principle at second reading because the shipper community is anxious to get the bill into the standing committee for detailed examination of the precise meaning, from a legal and a practical point of view, of all of the provisions in the bill. Shippers want to ensure, and we need to ensure, that their needs would actually be satisfied by the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168327">The shippers coalition supporting level-of-service legislation, as it has become known, is a very broad and comprehensive coalition. It obviously involves agriculture, and that is a big and important part of the shipper community, but it goes far beyond agriculture. It also includes the forest products sector, minerals and chemicals, potash and fertilizer, manufactured goods and much more. They have all had common issues and a common problem, which is substandard service from the railways in shipping their products and commodities to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168328">The intense debate about railway service levels has been raging across the country since about 2006. In 2007, specific requests were made by the shipper community for a legislated solution. They asked for a legislated solution because a commercial solution did not appear to be available. In 2008, the Government of Canada promised a formal review of railway services. It was not until a year later though, 2009, when the government finally appointed a panel to conduct that review of railway services. The panel worked for about a year, and by October of 2010 it had finished its work and had written its report. In that report the panel confirmed that service levels provided by the railways were seriously deficient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168329">To give just one example, and there are dozens referred to in the panel's report, farmers could typically count on getting the service from the railways that they needed, that they ordered and that they paid for, only about 50% of the time. That is obviously not an adequate level of performance by the railways. Similar troubles affected most other shippers right across the broad spectrum of the coalition. The details differed from one industry to another, but the bottom line was the same: the shipper community was being badly served. That is what the panel concluded in the report it wrote in the fall of 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168330">The review panel said that the problem was a serious imbalance in clout and power in the marketplace, an imbalance between the railways on one side and the shippers on the other. The shippers are mostly captive, as I said in the House earlier today. They do not have competitive options for moving their products. They are captive to one particular shipper at any given moment in time. That is what the panel concluded. It said there was little genuine competition, that shippers have no realistic commercial alternatives and that they also have no legal recourse to address the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168331">For the most part, they do not even have access to enforceable contracts that set out both their obligations and the railways' obligations, which are then binding and enforceable on both sides. That would be one's normal commercial expectation. The parties doing business would write up a contract and they would fulfill the terms of the contract or there would be consequences one way or the other. That practice seems to be missing in the relationship between the railways and the shipper community. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168332">According to the panel that was appointed by the government and which reported in the fall of 2010, the playing field is totally tilted in the railways' favour. The panel said that if that imbalance is to be remedied it would be preferable to do it by commercial means. However, if a commercial solution is not readily available, and that is obviously the case by this long process that has gone on since 2006, then the review panel said that there should be legislation and regulations to fix the problem. That is, there should be legislation to require the railways to provide their shipping customers with service level agreements that are readily enforceable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168333">The railways have said, “That was then and this is now” and claim that things have improved. I think objectively a number of shippers would say that indeed there have been some service improvements over the course of the last three or four years, especially service improvements by CN. Even CN notes that the controversy about bad service and the suggestion of some new legislation or new regulations coming down the pike have, at least in part, brought about that improvement. In other words, there has been a threat hanging in the air that there may be legislation or regulations and the railways have pulled up their socks a bit. It was in response to that threat of legislation, the speculation in the community that there would be legislation, that has in fact contributed to the level of service improvements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168334">The review panel's report was done in October of 2010. The government then waited six months before committing to implement its recommendations. That commitment finally came forward in the spring of 2011, ironically just on the eve of the calling of an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168335"> After the election, action was once again postponed. Instead of bringing the legislation forward in the late spring or early summer of 2011, which was an imminent possibility, the government waited another six months. Then it launched a second review process, this one to be conducted by Mr. Jim Dinning of Alberta. That process started in the fall of 2011 and ran until the spring of 2012, again trying to find this elusive commercial solution to the problem. Unfortunately, Mr. Dinning's efforts were largely for naught and there were no significant results from that process, except for another six month delay. The government then waited another six months, until this past December, to finally table the legislation that we have before us today, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168336">This has been a painfully long wait. The discussion began back in 2006 and we are now in 2013, so it has been a seven-year process. The shippers are anxious now for action, at long last, to become promptly tangible. I think the House owes them that. We should have a sound debate at second reading on Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, but it does not need to be a protracted debate. We should discuss it properly and efficiently in the House and then move Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> as quickly as we can to committee so that we can hear from shippers and others and, on the basis of their evidence and testimony, determine if Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is in fact good enough to get the job done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168337">I hope the government would ensure that there are no restrictions put on the transportation committee in hearing the witnesses that will want to be heard on this very important matter. The shipper community has been waiting a long time. Now that the bill will soon be at committee, the very least that Parliament can do is to give the shippers the opportunity to be heard fully so that all of their comments, recommendations and advice can be taken into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168338">The preliminary reviews of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> have been reasonably positive. That is encouraging. It would appear that the legislation does provide all shippers the right to have an enforceable service level agreement with the railways without discrimination among different tiers or categories of shippers. If that proves to be the case when we have the opportunity to legally and comprehensively review the legislation, then that would indeed be progress.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168339">The legislation also appears to specify at least some of the mandatory content that each service level agreement must cover. It also appears that it would provide robust penalties if the railways fail to perform up to an acceptable standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168340">The shipper community has been quite explicit about the kinds of things they want to see in these proposed service level agreements. It readily admits that with each particular shipper or sector within the shipper community there would be variations from agreement to agreement. Each one would not be an exact cookie-cutter copy of the others. There are logical differences that would need to be taken into account and there is a commercial negotiation process that would need to take place here. However, shippers have specified six subject areas that they think every service level agreement should deal with. It is important to put these on the record so that when we get to the committee we can examine the legislation to see if these six areas would be adequately covered. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168341">The shippers say that each service level agreement that the railways would be required to provide in negotiation to their shippers should include the following. First, it should include a section covering the services and the obligations. They should spell out what each side is supposed to do to have a successful contract between the carrier and the shipper. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168342">Second, it should include communications protocols so that when they are trying to work out their commercial relationship, or if things go wrong in the relationship, they would all know exactly what they are supposed to do to communicate with one another in an effective way, rather than two ships passing in the night that never quite get around to connecting with each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168343">Third, there would need to be performance standards specified in the agreements. What is the acceptable performance to be expected in the circumstances? Fourth, there would have to be performance metrics. In other words, how do you measure the performance against the standards laid out in the agreements?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168344">Five, there would need to be consequences for non-performance. There are obviously penalties provided in the legislation. We will have to examine as to whether they would be appropriate and sufficient to achieve the kind of behaviours that the shippers want to see. Finally, there would need to be dispute settlement mechanisms included in the agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168345">Those are the six areas that the shipper community mentioned. It is important for the committee to examine in detail whether Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would cover those areas adequately from the point of view of the shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168346">Finally, I will mention four or five other areas, beyond the nature of the contract that I have just described, where the shippers have said they are not clear about what the legislation seeks to accomplish and whether it would get to the result that the shippers want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168347">First is the issue of train movement into the United States. To what extent would a service level agreement in Canada also affect the kind of service that is provided across the border by the carrier, in some cases the same railway, when that carrier is operating in the territory of the United States? What would be the impact of service level agreements on cross-border shipments of product? Of course, between Canada and the United States, that is a huge volume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168348">Second, what would be the relationship between the service level agreements that apply to the main line rail carriers, basically CN and CP, when the product being shipped may originate on a short-line branch railway? Would the service level agreements have any implications for short-line rail operators and their relationship with the main railway operations?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168349">Third, there is already a section in the Canada Transportation Act, section 113, that provides some description of service requirements imposed upon the carriers. Is there anything in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> that diminishes the value or the effect of what is already in the act in section 113? The shippers are very anxious to have that clarified. Obviously they, and we, would not want to see the beneficial impact of section 113 diminished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168350">The fourth question that shippers have asked is on the matter of practical access to the process. The way the legislation is set up it basically says that the parties should go out and negotiate a contract. If they cannot, then the shipper can go to the CTA and get an arbitrated solution that will then be imposed by regulation. The question from the shippers is whether there will be practical access to that process or whether the process will be so complex, costly and slow that only the biggest shippers will be able to participate in the proposed arbitration proceedings. As a result, the smaller shippers will just find it too complicated, expensive or time-consuming to be able to avail themselves of an arbitration procedure. We will need to examine the practicality of how Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> will apply to make it accessible to all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168351">Finally, there appears to be a section in the act that says that if a shipper already has some kind of existing contract with a railway, if they have gone out and tried to negotiate something and put it in place, then the shippers do not have access to the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> unless and until that existing contract expires. That needs to be clarified as well. To what extent are shippers impeded from having any benefit of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> because they have already tried in some way to have a contract and have negotiated something, whether or not it lives up the standards of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>? Would they be prohibited from trying to get a Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> solution if they already have a contract in place?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168352">Those are some of the questions that I have heard from the shipping community. By and large they are anxious to see the legislation proceed. They are looking forward to the committee hearings because they want to be heard and they have a number of questions to ask. I think it is incumbent upon the government and upon the House to make sure that we get into those hearings as quickly as possible and that we ensure that every shipper across the country that wants to be heard can have the opportunity to present their questions and their observations to the standing committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168353">I welcome the debate this afternoon. I am anxious to see progress on this subject. Everybody has already been waiting far too long. Let us get on with it and try to make a tangible difference in the level of service that is provided to the shipping community, and therefore make a tangible contribution to the well-being and success of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168357">With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, I do have to suggest that the hon. gentleman's recollection of history is just a little faulty. Alexander Mackenzie was not the prime minister in 1783. It was 1873 that he was the prime minister and he discovered on his desk the first day he walked into the office the Pacific scandal about the railway that was handed to him by Sir John A. Macdonald. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168358">It is a bit of a waste of time to debate those ancient Conservative scandals. It was about the time that Louis Riel was becoming the member of Parliament for my district of the country. In any event, those historical references are fascinating, but it is more important for us to get on with the task of actually dealing with the circumstance today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168359">The major debate, as the hon. gentleman will recall, before 2006, was not about level of service agreements; it was about a costing review and whether railways were overcharging. There were in fact legal actions going on during the 1990s and the early part of the last decade that resulted in some major refunds to farmers because the railways had been caught overcharging for the freight rates they imposed for the services they were delivering, as substandard as those services were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168360">Until the middle part of this last decade, the issue was a costing review. In the latter part of the last decade, the issue shifted to this whole discussion about level of service, which brought about the seven year process that I talked about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168361">The hon. gentleman can be assured that we have no intention of delaying the legislation, either in the House or in committee, with this one caveat. We want to hear what the shippers say. If the shippers' expectations are properly and adequately addressed when we hear the testimony going through the committee, then we will be most anxious to see the legislation passed with whatever subsequent modifications the shippers might recommend.</ParaText>

This bill would enable the federal government to collect fines of up to $100,000. Does he think this would deter a company like CN, which made a profit of $2.7 billion in 2012? Is this kind of measure one of the amendments he would like to make to the bill?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168369">Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear the hon. gentleman's confidence. I have had the pleasure of consulting with many of those shippers myself over the course of the last five or six years. They have been very frustrated by the length of time this has taken, but they are hopeful that it will now come to a successful conclusion. They do though have a number of technical questions, partly for clarification reasons, to understand exactly what the legal and practical consequences will be of some of the wording that is included in the bill. They also have at least some suggestions for improvements where they think some of the areas need to be strengthened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168370">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is important legislation that should be intended, and I think is intended, to level up the imbalance in the playing field that was described by the review panel that reported in the fall of 2010. We all now need to be focused on ensuring it does accomplish that objective. We will know that when we allow shippers who want to be heard the opportunity to come before the committee, give their testimony, give their approval or criticism whichever it may be. If they have specific recommendations for making the bill better, then I hope the committee will be open to receiving those recommendations for improvements.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168371">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170512" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168372">As I said earlier today, I got into politics to, in my own small way, expand freedom so people could take responsibility for their own lives, earn success and own their destiny. To make space for this freedom, I believe governments should only do the things that people cannot do for themselves. It is therefore with great skepticism that I always approach any proposal that legislates government action within the economy. The question is this. Does this legislation represent an action that is needed but that people cannot do on their own? In analyzing the industry of which we speak, I believe it does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168373">Canada is the second largest with the eighth least dense population of any country on earth. There are 5,500 kilometres separating Cape Spear, Newfoundland from the Yukon-Alaska border. On these vast lands, with much of them thinly populated, the prospect of ubiquitous railway competition is almost impossible. It is not the result of human error. It is the result of physical geography and math. As a result, we have only two class A railways in the country and many communities that require for their economic lifeblood the export of products to far away markets often have only one choice to ship those products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168374">Seventy per cent of Canada's goods and services are moved by surface freight. However, as I have said, we have only two class A railways to move them and in many places there is only one option. This creates immense economic imbalances between the buyer and the seller of the service. As such, there is a consensus that some redress of this economic imbalance is justified in this rare circumstance. As a result, we have proposed Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, the fair rail freight service act, which is designed to do as I just described. Allow me to describe the practices that this law would codify. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168375">The legislation would give shippers the right to a service level agreement with a railway. A shipper would now be able to ask their railway for an agreement and the railway would be obligated to provide one within 30 days. This statutory right to an agreement would be an important gain for all shippers, including small and medium-sized shippers. This right would allow shippers to initiate bilateral commercial negotiations with the railway and clarify in writing the service agreement the railway would provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168376">These agreements could identify performance standards such as frequency of service, transit times and the number and type of cars that the railway would provide to the shipper. These agreements could also include recovery plans that identified the actions the railway would undertake to recover from service failure or the communication protocols for monitoring service performance and dealing with any service issues that might arise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168377">In most cases, shippers should be able to reach an agreement with their railway commercially, but when they cannot, the shipper should be able to go to the Canadian Transportation Agency and ask an independent arbitrator to establish service agreements for them. Furthermore, the shipper should now be able to trigger a fast and efficient arbitration process, thanks to the bill. All he or she has to do is demonstrate that an effort has been made to reach an agreement commercially and give advance notice to the railway before commencing or requesting arbitration. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168378">Shippers get to control the timing of launching an arbitration process. The legislation allows shippers to frame the issues to be addressed in the arbitration process by identifying the services they need. This gives the shipper the ability and the flexibility to ask for what is important to them. Every shipper operates in unique circumstances and has unique needs, and that is why these agreements will take many different forms. Tailoring service agreements to suit circumstances of both shipper and railway will allow for the diverse nature of Canada's transportation economy to continue to flourish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168379">Let me be clear. The bill is not about forcing our railways into an agreement, but ensuring that their obligations are met. We want railways to continue to manage an efficient, low-cost network to meet the needs of all of their customers in their network. The arbitration will follow a very efficient process to make these decisions. In a market where time means money, shippers have repeatedly asked for a process that is quick and timely so they can focus on growing their businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168380">The bill stipulates that the shipper can get an arbitrated service agreement within 45 days, although this could be extended in unique circumstances by an additional 20 days. In very complex service agreements with the shipper and the railways, the extension would be applied. The point remains that this is a fast process, to ensure we continue the operation of our rail network and get our supplies to where they are most needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168381">I should note that the government acted with a great deal of meticulous care in setting up this process. We realize that in the last three decades the federal government has largely gone out of the rail business, through reduced regulation and obviously reduced ownership. This experience with a private sector railway system has been an unmitigated success. We should celebrate every day the success that our railways and their workers have created through this free enterprise system. We should congratulate them for the enormous improvements they have achieved in service standards, particularly when compared to their international peers. At the same time, without reintroducing excessive government intervention into the system, we are redressing a natural market imbalance that is inherent in most rail sectors around the world, and particularly so in a country with our geography and population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168382">We on this side of the House of Commons understand that a commodity-based economy, spread across vast distances, will require an efficient, effective rail system to move the commodities to their marketplace. That is why we have acted in this bill to provide a system by which our free market rail industry can continue to prosper and connect businesses with customers, and customers with the goods and services they need.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3168383">Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague for giving such an informative, accurate and superlative presentation on Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. As proof of that, Mr. Speaker, you saw that everyone clearly understood the value of the bill. They clearly understood my friend's message. Of course, there would be no questions or comments given that situation, so he is to be congratulated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168384">Let us look at the genesis of the bill and understand that Bill C-52 would not be in the House were there not some disparities in the rail service that has been provided to shippers across Canada by Canada's two railways. The <Affiliation DbId="170706" Type="4">Minister of State for Transport</Affiliation> this morning described that as a duopoly, which is just a hair's breadth away from a monopoly. The bill would not be in the House if the relationship between the railways and the shippers was a perfect one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168385">The relationship has been far from perfect. The shippers could be appropriately called “captive shippers”; there is little or no alternative for shipping their products. These are primarily bulk products from the agriculture, mining, oil and gas and propane sectors. Rail is the most economical and most profitable way to ship bulk shipments across Canada. I am sure that is a point that will not be debated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168386">I am happy to support Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52 </Document>because I have spent some time working with a particular sector that is prominent in my riding, the forest sector. While that sector reaches all across the country, my riding of Cariboo—Prince George, which I am sure my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170730" Type="2">Prince George—Peace River</Affiliation> would agree, could be appropriately called the forest capital of the world. In my riding, and the <Affiliation DbId="170770" Type="2">Peace River</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170658" Type="2">Okanagan—Shuswap</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170089" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170455" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="170736" Type="2">Kootenay—Columbia</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="170448" Type="2">Okanagan—Coquihalla</Affiliation> ridings, we all have sawmills, pulp mills, fibre mills and pellet mills. I can honestly say that those ridings combined probably ship the bulk of forest products from their locations to the U.S., Asia and abroad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168387">I serve as the chair of the Conservative forest caucus, and the members I just mentioned are part of that. I can remember, going back six years ago when I took on that position, that we were talking with the CEOs and the leaders in the forest industry across the country. They were telling us about some of the challenges they have; one of them was the rail service they were getting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168388">There were a number of other things, which our government has successfully addressed. One that we can be very proud of is the green transformation fund, which was a real winner in the forest industry across the country. It helped us to stay in tight competition with our U.S. counterparts. That is good because the U.S. is still our biggest market for forest products. We send the bulk of our products into the U.S. by rail, as we send to the coast for shipments overseas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168389">I remember this meeting from about four years ago. We had solved most of the problems and challenges and we asked what was left. They said we still need to deal with the service we are getting from the railways. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168390">My colleagues and I made a promise to the leaders of the industry. We said that it was number one on our bucket list, that we would see this fixed. We said that we would get this solved one way or another and we began to work on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168391">I will not say we did not have encouragement from colleagues across the way. It is a common interest. I thank them for their assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168392">We pushed that forward. There were a multitude of meetings where we got a very clear understanding of the problems with which the forest product shippers were faced. Also, it became evident that they did not have any means to seek remedy to get those problems fixed. There were problems such as were mentioned today, where an individual was expecting to have 65 railcars on site for the week of July 5, had a promise they would be there, only to find that after the shipper had geared all the production to be shipped that week, there were 37 cars, not 65. When the shipper called up the rail lines to ask where the rest of the cars were the answer was that they had not been able to get them, that they would give them to the shipper as soon as they got them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168393">That is not good enough. When railways make a promise to shippers that they will have 65 or 75 cars in that particular week, they have to keep that promise because an agreement, honesty and a good working relationship is all about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168394">When shippers have cars show up to the pulp mills, where they are shipping rolls and bales of pulp and paper out of their mills and lo and behold there are holes in the roof and it is raining, they know there will be damage to the cargo inside. That is unacceptable. They need to have a way to seek remedy to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168395">Shippers can be in production and all of a sudden 27 cars show up that were not ordered. When they phone the rail line, they are told that they probably will need them. If they say they do not need them for two weeks, they are told they already have them. They are then paying demurrage on them every day they are sitting on the site while they are trying to gear production to get them full. They did not ask for them, but they have them and they are paying rent on them until they use them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168396">The way it has been in the past is if the captive shippers, as I will call them again, were to bring their complaints to the rail lines, they could not seek a remedy that would be lasting. That is why they looked for help from the government. They tried to have a commercial arrangement that would solve things, but that was just simply not possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168397">They looked to the government. We were pleased to step in and get this service agreement done so it would satisfy the shippers across the country, while at the same time it would make it something that the rail lines could work with. We know how important they are to moving goods back and forth across the country. It has to be an agreement that works for both sides. I think we have that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168398">It has been applauded by the shippers' coalition and major shippers across the country, since we put it all together after continuous discussions with them, trying to figure out how we could solve the problem. What would the remedy time be? How long would we give to get the agreement to work, to get the thing fixed? We have fines in there for not having remedies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168399">I am proud to stand here with my colleagues who have forest industries in their ridings, who were there to make that promise to the forest industry that we would get this fixed. These folks are from all across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168400">Our government has now done it. I want to thank the minister and the minister of state for their hard work in putting this together. I thank the forest industry for giving us the opportunity to put this together for it, to work with it. We thank it for their input.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168401">Let us hope the bill will pass through the House and committee quickly. Maybe it can be approved. It is pretty good right now. At the end of the line, we will bring out the best product that these shippers can possibly expect.</ParaText>

We think Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> contains the substance we need, including the period of time from when the complaint is first brought, the time allowed to resolve it and, if not resolved, a brief arbitration period, which can be extended for a short time. At that time, if the railways, for whatever reason, fail to rectify the situation they are subject to fines of $100,000 per day per complaint. If one single shipper has five complaints about bad rail cars, that would be $500,000 a day.

I would also like to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> for her tremendous and brilliant work on this issue. I am sure that we have her to thank for the fact that the Conservative government decided to do something about this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168414">I would like to go over some facts and talk about why this bill came into being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168415">Rail transportation is the backbone of Canada's economy because 70% of our goods are shipped by rail. That is why it is critical that rail transportation services benefit both rail transportation companies and shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168416">The cost of rail transportation is also hurting Canadian shippers. Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is silent on the issue of rates because the government ignored the demands of a number of groups of shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168417">Canada's trade deficit continues to grow. It hit $2 billion in November. We cannot allow Canada's products to lose more ground competing on the world markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168418">Rail transportation is essential not only to competitiveness, but also to the domestic economy. We also need rail transportation services to help keep trucks off the roads and to curb our greenhouse gas emissions. Although railways still make up a considerable proportion of surface transportation, frustrated businesses are turning to trucks when possible, and that is devastating to our environment. That is important to note.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168419">We must also look at the economy as a whole, since Canada's trade deficit is increasing. As I mentioned, it reached nearly $2 billion in November, and our economy cannot afford to lose even more ground in light of the global situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168420">The Conservatives' reluctance in the past to do anything for Canada's rail shippers shows their overall attitude towards rail transportation. Whether it is their inaction on new railway safety measures, cuts to VIA Rail Canada or their opposition to bringing high-speed rail service to Canada, the Conservatives refuse to give Canada's railway network the attention it deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168421">The Conservatives are taking a piecemeal approach to this country's transportation infrastructure that shows a lack of interest and a lack of investment. This is the case in my riding, which used to be a railway riding. It no longer is and we have to wonder why. One answer is the clear lack of investment to keep these railways running. Railways and their tracks are increasingly being sold off, when they could be used for other purposes, such as public transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168422">Instead of letting things go and making only occasional investments here and there, Canada needs a comprehensive approach to transportation that is based on a national public transportation and railway strategy. For years, farmers and other businesses have been paying the price for the poor quality of rail freight services, and have not managed to get Ottawa's attention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168423">The NDP's position is simple. We support businesses and exporters. We are determined to get them the transportation services they need and deserve.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168424">Even though Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> does not follow through on certain demands from stakeholders, it should receive our support. I am rising in the House today because shippers are happy with it, more or less. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168425">Now it is up to us to fill in the gaps, strengthen this bill for shippers and underscore the NDP's participation throughout the process. As I mentioned earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> has done some excellent work on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168426">We will keep working to ensure that we improve our country's rail transportation system and use it for what it was intended: to meet economic and environmental needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168427">Unfortunately, Bill C-52 will cover only new service level agreements, and not those that already exist. Many shippers will have to continue to cope with unreliable and unfair service without any access to dispute resolution if their existing service agreements are violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168428">Arbitration is available only for shippers who are in the midst of negotiating new contracts. Instead of offering fast, reliable conflict resolution for all shippers, as the NDP is asking for, Bill C-52 is offering a limited arbitration process for a small group of shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168429">The proposed arbitration process may be too costly for shippers. The burden of proof may be unfair if they have to prove that they are in need of services from the railway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168430">Certain shippers also wanted to tackle the issue of tariffs during the legislative process, but unfortunately the Conservatives made it clear that they would not address that issue until the next legislative review of the Canada Transportation Act in 2014-15.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168431">Obviously, shippers agreed to look at tariffs at a later date and to focus on problems with service level agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168432">It is worth repeating that the mining sector is the second-largest employer in aboriginal communities, after the public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168433">Improving rail freight transportation services for mining companies could also be of economic benefit to aboriginal people in certain areas of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168434">The whole question of rail freight is particularly important to rural areas. I come from a rural area. The industries that will be most affected by this are in western Canada, in British Columbia, as well as in Quebec and, to a lesser degree, Ontario. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for everyone and for parliamentarians to really effect positive change for people in rural areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168435">The Prairies are very sparsely populated, for instance. However, this matter is important to the small towns and rural communities of the Prairies, and those are the main groups we should be reaching out to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168436">Nearly 100 communities depend on the forest industry for their survival. That is the case in my riding, where most forestry-related transportation is done by truck. Why not invest in the railways that exist in my riding to transport lumber? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168437">My colleagues and I would like to see penalties included in the agreements in relation to service levels, in order to compensate shippers for service disruptions, damages and loss of productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168438">Shippers are also afraid, and I agree with them, that this bill will not apply to rail shipments from Canada to the U.S. Why not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168439">In closing, this is an important piece of legislation. It needs improvements. Of course we hope this government will keep an open mind and accept many of our recommendations. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168447">Mr. Speaker, I live on Vancouver Island and we have been in pretty desperate straits with regard to rail service. Our passenger rail service has not been in operation for a number of years because of the state of the tracks and the other infrastructure. Our freight service is in jeopardy as well, although it is still operating. However, on Vancouver Island it is an important part of our transportation infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168448">In some of our rural communities rail infrastructure is critical for our economy and the environment as well because it helps keep some of those trucks off the road. In Nanaimo—Cowichan we have something called the Malahat and several times a year that road is regularly shut down, either due to accidents or due to weather conditions. The rail service then is even more critical for moving freight. I wonder if the member could comment on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168452"> She said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House today to begin the debate at second reading on Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document>, a sodium reduction bill for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168453">I know that when we choose our private members' bills a lot of thought goes into it because we basically get one shot at it. I did put a lot of thought into what I would bring forward for my private member's bill. As the health critic for the official opposition for the NDP, I tried to think of a measure that would have a very significant impact in improving the health of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168454"> After looking at a whole number of issues and talking with a lot of people, I decided that this was probably one of the single most important issues that could be brought forward because of the over-consumption of sodium in all of our diets. I selected the bill because there has already been an incredible amount of work done on a sodium reduction plan for Canada. The provinces and territories and experts have basically come together and said that we absolutely have to do something in terms of reducing the amount of sodium that Canadian ingest. That is why I brought forward the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168455">Over-consumption of sodium is a major contributor to heart attacks, strokes and other illnesses in Canada. In fact, StatsCan estimates that Canadians currently consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended intake of 1,500 milligrams. It is estimated that 77% of the sodium consumed by Canadians comes from prepackaged food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168456">Anyone of us could go into a grocery store and see Canadians poring over labels and trying to figure out what it is that they are eating. People do want to make healthy choices, but the way things are constructed now and the amount of sodium that is in the food that we are eating is really quite astronomical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168457">The bill seeks to reduce sodium levels in the food supply by implementing the sodium reduction strategy for Canada. This is not a strategy that I came up with, it is a strategy that already exists. It was developed by the expert sodium working group in 2010. It was a group that was set up by the minister. Their report was released in 2010, but it has not yet been implemented by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168458">The core of my bill is to implement that strategy. The bill also prioritizes a number of areas where work needs to be done by ensuring that the amount of sodium in prepackaged and restaurant foods is reduced to safe levels. It will improve the labelling of sodium on foods. It will help protect children from being deceived by advertisements for high-sodium foods. Here I want to use Quebec as a model. Quebec has a very successful program around advertising as it affects children. This is a model that we should be using in all of Canada to protect children from the junk food and high-sodium content that they are ingesting without even knowing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168459">The bill would establish the Government of Canada as the leader in monitoring and ensuring progress is being made by food companies to achieve sodium reduction plans. All the details about how this will be done are in the bill. It is very clearly laid out. As I say, the core of the bill is to implement the strategy, which already exists from 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168460">In developing the bill, I had tremendous support from across the country. I have been working with different organizations on the bill. I just want to quote from some of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168461">Bill Jeffery, national coordinator of the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, has done incredible work on this issue over many years. In fact, he was a member of the sodium working group. In his press conference yesterday, he pointed out that this year as many as 16,000 Canadians will die needlessly of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes caused by excess dietary sodium, three-quarters of which is added to foods by food manufacturers and restaurants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168462">As well, the Canadian Medical Association and its president, Dr. Anna Reid, said:</ParaText>

High sodium levels in food are responsible for almost one-third of hypertension cases in Canada. Hypertension is a major cause of heart disease (heart attack and heart failure), stroke and kidney failure, and it is an important contributor to premature death, disability and health care costs in Canada. It is estimated that 7.5 million Canadians have been diagnosed with this chronic condition, with an estimated 1,100 new patients being added every day.</QuotePara>

Some members in the House may remember that a year ago we all received a letter that was addressed to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and was signed by 17 major organizations across Canada, including the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Medical Association. That letter was a real convergence of medical and scientific individuals, experts and organizations who came together with a very significant letter to the Prime Minister. In their letter of January 2012, they said:</ParaText>

The argument that the sodium implementation plan would fail to garner commitment from industry sends the clear message to Canadians that private interest takes precedence over food safety and [the] health and wellness [of Canadians]...</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168472"> This was a very thoughtful and well-worded message to the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168473">In addition, since we have been developing this bill and it was introduced a number of months ago, we now have close to 40 organizations and key experts across the country who are supporting it. They include: the Canadian Medical Association; the Canadian Public Health Association; the Dietitians of Canada; the Canadian Nurses' Association; the Canadian Pharmacists Association; Public Health Physicians of Canada; Canadian Federation of Nurses Union; Hypertension Canada; the Kidney Foundation of Canada; Food Secure Canada; Canadian Institute for Child Health; Canadian Society of Internal Medicine; the Canadian Women's Health Network.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168474">I have just read a very few of the endorsers. These are organizations, and also a number of individuals, that have specifically endorsed this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168475">I am very interested to hear the comments of government members and of other opposition members. Rarely, in public discourse, is there a time when a number of different interests come together where there is a very strong consensus and that is what we have seen on sodium reduction. Let us remember that there was an expert working group put together by the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>. It produced a report by consensus. It was a unanimous report. It included industry representatives. That report came out and there was no follow-up from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168476">In addition to that, the provinces and the territories, in their own meetings, have considered this issue. They too have called on the federal government to take action on implementing a sodium reduction strategy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168477">We see the body and the weight of all of these organizations across the country. It seems to me that we are at a particular time where there is a very broad consensus about the need to take serious action and to show we do put public health and public interests as the top priority. If this plan were implemented, there have been estimates that we could save something like $2 billion a year in health costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168478"> I am also concerned about the kids. We think about our kids and what they eat. I know many us here are parents who have young children and we do the best we can to make sure our children eat well; yet, it is so difficult to do with the array of products that are around us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168479">When we think about the health of our children as they grow into adults, sodium is not the only issue. There are many factors to a healthy lifestyle. There are things we can do ourselves, and that is certainly something that is part of the bill, by advocating for education and proper information and disclosure. However, it seems to me that the need to ensure there is a sodium reduction plan that is real, meaningful and takes proper steps is absolutely essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168480">Many other countries have done this. The World Health Organization lists it as a priority. The sticking point is probably going to be whether it is voluntary or whether there is a plan that has clear target reductions, as my bill would lay out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168481">We have had a voluntary regime and opportunity now for many years, and frankly it has failed. It is now imperative that we see this as a public health issue that impacts all of Canada and all Canadians. The federal government must demonstrate its leadership and commitment to follow through on the incredible body of work and the plan being produced. That is a duty. It is a public responsibility, and anything less than that is a cop-out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168482">I want to argue today that continuing on some kind of voluntary path has not produced the results we need to see. The bill would move us in a direction to adopt the plan that was agreed to by the expert sodium working group. It is a reasonable proposition. The steps contained within it are reasonable, and I think it is achievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168483">I would encourage all members of the House to not dismiss the bill because it has come from the opposition, but to look at the merits of the bill and who supports the bill. These organizations are non-partisan. They base their decisions on merit. They base their decisions about what they do on evidence, on medical information. When they say they are supporting the bill, maybe they do not agree with everything, every word—if it goes to committee, we will take a look at that—but the principle of the bill and what it is trying to do is there, and it is showing it has very broad support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168484">I am happy we are having this debate, and I look forward to the debate. I certainly encourage all members of the House, from all sides, to look at the bill in all seriousness. I want members to consider what we are here for and what we do to uphold public health, the public interest, to represent our constituents, and most of all, the future generation of kids, who we want to make sure have the best opportunity to grow up healthy in this wonderful country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168485">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for bringing this issue forward. Earlier I noticed a salt shaker on the member's desk, and this addresses the major problem with the bill. It addresses processed foods. The NDP could spend millions of dollars on a sodium registry, but Canadians who want choice can still pick up that salt shaker and put salt on their food. That is why our voluntary approach is better, especially with the education and collaboration, and it is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168486">My question is quite straightforward. In the member's bill, Quebec can opt out. I want to ask why. Would this not create a two-tiered sodium system and give Quebec a monopoly on certain products? For Canadians who want choice, especially around Super Bowl, I would not want to see Canadians smuggling potato chips and cheeses across the Quebec border.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168489">I am very surprised that the only thing the member can come up with in the bill is this issue about Quebec. We could get into a great discussion now about Canadian federalism, but I think he is aware that a number of bills that come forward in the House are very respectful of Quebec and its role in Confederation. The fact is that a number of bills have this clause to respect the jurisdiction of Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168490">This is not about creating two tiers but a pan-Canadian strategy working within federalism, a strategy that the NDP has laid out on so many occasions. We have put forward many bills, whether on child care, post secondary education, housing, and now the sodium reduction bill, recognizing how we work as a federation in this country and with Quebec. This bill simply reflects that very strong principle that we have always put forward.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3168494">Mr. Speaker, the impact, first and foremost, is that Canadians would have a lot more information about what they are eating, whether their purchases in grocery stores or meals in restaurants. To me, that is very important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168495">Part of the issue here is to track what is happening with sodium reduction and to make sure that is fully disclosed. I think that more and more people are very interested in what is going on. People do take their own health very seriously. Therefore, within the bill, some of the impacts would certainly be better education and better information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168496"> At the end of the day it is about meeting the targets that have already been laid out in guidelines from Health Canada but are simply not being met. That is the irony of the bill. It is all there. The work has been done and all been laid out, but it is actually not being implemented. It is not that I am creating anything new with this bill but implementing what we already know and what needs to be done.</ParaText>

The Government of Canada is committed to helping Canadians move toward healthier diets. We do this in many ways, one of the most notable being Canada's food guide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168498">When it comes to sodium, our government has already taken meaningful action and this approach is working. That is why I will not be supporting Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document>.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168499">For a bit of background, the government established a sodium working group in 2007, which included representatives from food manufacturing and food service industry groups, health-focused non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, consumer advocacy groups, health professional organizations and government. The working group produced the report, “Sodium Reduction Strategy for Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168500">The report recommended that the government adopt a voluntary approach to reduce the average amount of sodium that Canadians consume from 3,400 milligrams per day to 2,300 milligrams per day by 2016. It was also recommended that the approach engage different kinds of stakeholders, including the food industry, provincial and territorial governments and Canadians themselves.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168501">Let us be clear: our government is totally willing to co-operate with our partners in order to achieve that goal. Our government has already begun implementing a voluntary system meant to reduce the average amount of sodium that Canadians should consume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168502">Our approach is based on three main pillars: increasing awareness and educating Canadians; guiding the industry towards reducing the amount of sodium in processed foods; and research.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168503">I will discuss our government's approach in more detail a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168504">Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document> references the sodium working group's report but proposes a much more heavy-handed approach. Instead of a voluntary approach, the bill calls for new legislative and regulatory measures to implement the sodium reduction strategy for Canada. Sodium levels in foods would be heavily regulated and industry would be required to report the sodium content in prepackaged food so that a public registry of this information could be established and maintained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168505">There are several problems with the bill. There would be financial costs to taxpayers, industry and Canadians. There may also be unintended risks to food safety and health. We would also lose the current balance that has been struck between the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. Finally, the measures proposed in this bill could not feasibly be regulated or enforced. Let me examine each of these issues in more detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168506">First, the cost to taxpayers to implement these measures would not be insignificant. New resources and regulations would be required to develop, implement and maintain a public registry for well over 100,000 products sold domestically. It is also not clear how this registry would be used. Foods that are low in sodium are not necessarily healthy foods. We would not want Canadians to think that any food that the registry says is low in sodium is healthy. Additional resources would also be required for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for compliance and enforcement activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168507">There would also be a significant burden to industry, the costs of which would likely be passed on to Canadians. Adopting this bill would take money out of the pockets of small businesses across the country and add layers of red tape. This would not be a good approach to take, especially during a time when the economy remains fragile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168508">The costs of implementing this bill go beyond financial impacts. Let me address two of the key health and safety risks that implementing this bill would pose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168509">First, the 90-day coming into force period would not afford industry the time needed to extensively reformulate food products. This is a significant oversight, as sodium is not only used for flavouring but also for food preservation and control of pathogens in food. The result could be unintended food safety consequences to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168510">Second, the warning statements proposed by the bill may be misleading to Canadians when they are trying to choose healthy foods. Products with no sodium warning statement could be perceived as healthy choices, even though they may not in fact be nutrient-rich foods. Nutrition labelling must cover all the bases if it is to have the desired positive effects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168511">We already have the nutrition facts table on prepackaged foods that provides information on various nutrients, including the sodium level in a serving of food and the percent daily value. A warning label for sodium alone could divert attention from this valuable tool.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168512">The government wants Canadians to have choices, and to have the information they need to reduce their sodium intake. To achieve that, we need to take more ambitious action than this bill proposes. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168513">In addition to financial costs and potential health risks, the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document> would not respect the important balance with stakeholders that has been struck in the work our government is already doing. Sodium reduction is a shared responsibility among the food industry, the Government of Canada, provincial and territorial governments and Canadians themselves. We need to continue with this balanced approach by engaging with all our partners and avoid shifting the majority of the burden onto any one stakeholder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168514">Finally, I mentioned that one of the problems with this bill is that the measures being proposed could not be feasibly regulated or enforced. Let me explain what I mean. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168515">In seeking to enable industry to provide Canadians with healthier choices, the Government of Canada engaged interested stakeholders to develop guidance to the food industry to reduce sodium in processed foods. This guidance was released less than a year ago. Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document> calls for this guidance to be put into regulation. Not only is that not feasible, but it is unnecessary. In order to understand why this is the case, I will take the House through the core elements of the guidance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168516">The guidance serves as a guide for the food industry to reduce sodium in its products by outlining sodium level benchmarks for processed food categories. The benchmarks have two components that must work together to be effective, a sales-weighted average and a maximum limit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168517">The Government of Canada has recognized that reducing sodium levels in the more popular products within the food category, such as bread, would have a greater impact than only targeting those with the high sodium levels. The sales-weighted average does this by taking into account the sales numbers across an entire food category, so that sodium levels would be reduced in products that are the most popular with Canadians. At the same time, the maximum limit targets the products within a food category that might otherwise remain high in sodium, such as salt and vinegar potato chips, to help decrease their sodium levels as well. It is the combination of the sales average and the maximum limit that will effectively reduce sodium content.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168518">In addition, the guidance cannot be put into regulation as it is not possible to enforce an average. Flexibility is needed to help ensure that the sodium in the more popular foods is reduced while still providing Canadians with the food options they expect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168519">The food industry is an active partner in achieving our collective goal. A regulatory approach is not required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168520">We can see that there are many concerns with Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document>.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168521">The Government of Canada adopted a different approach to reduce the amount of sodium consumed by Canadians. Our approach favours awareness and education, so that Canadians can make informed decisions regarding the food they eat.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3168522">In February 2012, the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> announced $4 million for new activities as part of the healthy eating and awareness initiative. A component of this is a social marketing campaign to raise awareness of healthy eating, including reducing sodium intake. The goal is to both educate and motivate Canadians to make healthy food choices. In addition, the food industry has already demonstrated willingness to put more healthy choices into the Canadian marketplace. As Canadians' demand for lower sodium options grows, industry will respond to that demand. We are also working with industry to collect information. Imposing mandatory reporting is simply unnecessary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168523">In fact, I am pleased to say that early progress toward the 2016 goal is already evident. The government carried out a small monitoring project to estimate changes in the sodium levels in three food categories that are popular with Canadians: bread, canned soups and cereals. The results of this project indicate that the majority of new products being introduced in these three categories have sodium levels below the 2016 maximum and existing products in these categories have seen reductions that will have them well placed to reach the goal by 2016. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168524">We have already seen the results that the bill says it would achieve. In fact, adopting the bill would jeopardize progress already being made through the current collaborative approaches. The Government of Canada continues to be committed to helping Canadians move toward healthier diets and creating conditions that make healthier choices easier choices. We are already beginning to see positive results. The heavy-handed approach proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document> is not necessary. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3168525">Mr. Speaker, I rise to support Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document> that would implement a sodium strategy that would be clear, concise, accountable, reportable and in fact achieve the goal of reducing sodium intake among Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168526">Why do we need this bill? Personally, I do not think we would have needed a bill like this if the government had been doing the work it was supposed to do. The Government of Canada has a responsibility, through the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, to protect the health of Canadians and to prevent disease where possible. That is the clear mandate of the Minister of Health and the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168527">As we heard from the hon. member who introduced the bill, high sodium intake creates hypertension or high blood pressure, as it is called, and heart disease and strokes. We know these have caused some of the highest numbers of deaths and disease in this country and cost a huge amount of money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168528">I noted that my colleague across the way, the hon. parliamentary secretary, talked about costs. The cost to the health care system from hypertension, stroke and heart disease is actually inestimable when one compares it to what it would cost to implement this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168529">In 2007 the government, under the then health minister, set up a sodium working group to look at the issue of the amount of sodium Canadians were taking. The group heard it was three times the amount that Canadians should be taking to keep them healthy and that it should do something about that. That was what the Minister of Health and the government did in 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168530">The sodium working group was set up, and in the interim the then Minister of Health suggested that there would be some voluntary guidelines put in place by industry to bring down the amount of sodium. Why industry? It is because the government cannot come into my kitchen and tell me how much salt I can put in my food. We know that 77% of high sodium intake in this country comes from processed foods. The Minister of Health said that the government would ask processed food manufacturers, the food industry and certain restaurants to look at this and voluntary diminish it until they heard from the working group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168531">The working group did that, coming down with its report in 2010, three years later. The working group decided it wanted bring down the current sodium intake by Canadians. It was already clearly defined by the working group that by 2016, 95% of Canadians would actually reduce their very high level of sodium consumption and have a set level of sodium.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168532">In the working group there were the food industry, academics and health care professionals. It is most important to note that there were two levels of government at the table. There were federal and provincial governments. They all had a role to play. The only government that had a role to play in ensuring that regulations were put in place to decrease the amount of sodium was the federal government. The provinces were there at the table because they have to take on the high cost of health care when people get sick, so they have a vested interest in this. Only the federal government could have done the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168533">That is why I said that this bill should not have been necessary. In 2010, when the report came down, it was found that the work in the interim that was being voluntarily undertaken by industry to bring down sodium levels was not working. Nothing was happening. In 2010, all of the people and groups within the sodium working group, including health care professionals and the provinces, looked to the federal government and suggested getting an implementation strategy moving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168534">Nothing happened. In fact, the current <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> moved very swiftly to disband the group so that nothing could happen, so that no follow up could be done. I do not even understand why a minister of health would do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168535">This is not new. Members have seen the same <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and same government, who have a mandate to protect Canadians' health and decrease the amount of disease in Canada where possible, fail abysmally on the sodium strategy. They have done nothing, except to say they will educate people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168536">That is good, but education is only one part of any kind of strategy to bring about a decrease in certain risky health behaviours. We all know that. We have seen that with tobacco and with practically every other thing that used to cause death a long time ago and now has changed. There is evidence that tells us that this is how things work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168537">The minister has had a result from the sodium working group. She has had reports from her own health department. Provinces and territories have asked her to do something about this because voluntary initiatives are not working. The minister disbanded the working group and has done absolutely nothing. This is now five years later. This is 2013. Nothing has happened. Imagine how many people continue to increase their intake of salt and continue to be at risk and get hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Obviously this does not seem to matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168538">I heard the parliamentary secretary say that it is totally useless to regulate. One of the tools the government has is regulation. Governments exist for that. They do not exist to tell me how much salt to put in my pot. Governments can educate me but they have the duty and the responsibility to regulate foods for Canadians' safety, to regulate the content of harmful ingredients in any food. Governments around the world have been doing this for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168539">Let me tell members what some governments are doing. The United Kingdom has a food standards association that holds the government's feet to the fire as it has now put in regulations to reduce salt consumption by adults. Finland has taken legislative action and is a world leader in population-wide salt reduction primarily through punitive high salt labelling. It punishes industry that goes above the levels. Then there is Ireland, which does not punish but rewards industry. It uses a positive reinforcement methodology where it legislates and regulates and then it advertises those companies that meet the standards. Ireland has used one tact and Finland is using another. At the end of the day, governments are using their legislative authority and their regulatory authority to change the salt content in food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168540">In Canada we have a medicare system where we pay for everyone's illness and disease when they get sick and they need medically necessary care. The cost to the system will be extraordinary if we do not take steps to do this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168541">Once again, I do not understand why the government has not done it with sodium. I do not understand why it has not done it with trans fats. The government has had every single advisory group, including the health department, tell it that it must regulate trans fats in processed foods. It has not done it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168542">Then we have the issue of energy drinks. The president of the United States has taken this on as a personal agenda, to look at what that country can do to regulate or legislate energy drinks. Canadians have died from drinking energy drinks. The minister moved to do one thing. She said the allowable amount of caffeine in energy drinks will be dropped to a certain level, but the point is that even that level is unacceptable. All people asked for was for them to be sold behind the counter in pharmacies, but that is too much for the government to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168543">Obviously the government and the minister seem to favour not getting industry angry at them. If the <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> was doing that I would understand. That is his mandate. The <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health's</Affiliation> mandate has nothing to do with industry. The Minister of Health's mandate is to protect Canadians and prevent disease. Why has she not done anything about it? Now the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> has to bring forward a bill to tell the government it must do what it is supposed to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168545"> The hon. member has brought forward a bill. I support the bill but nothing is going to come of it. We have a majority government that could and should have the political will to do what it must to help Canadians with their health, to help them prevent disease, to help protect them from illnesses, but that is not happening. I support the bill but I do not think it will get anywhere, and that is a very sad indictment of the Conservative government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3168546">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to add to the discussion about Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document>, which was introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>. She is the opposition health critic. I wholeheartedly support this bill, which aims to implement the sodium reduction strategy for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168547">Sodium intake is a serious public health issue in Canada. Health Canada has made recommendations for sodium intake. The recommended daily intake is 1,500 milligrams for an adult under the age of 50. The average Canadian has a sodium intake of about 3,400 milligrams, or more than double the daily recommendation. The department goes so far as to set a tolerable upper intake level of 2,300 milligrams. Without question, Canadians are consuming too much sodium, and we are far exceeding the target amounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168548">The government has a role to play, but it also has everything to gain. Excess sodium is eating away at the health of Canadians. Reducing sodium intake to 1,800 milligrams a day would reduce the number of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, by 23,500. High sodium intake is also a significant factor in hypertension, as we all know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168549">Hypertension in Canada has reached a worrisome level. Forty percent of Canadians have hypertension or prehypertension. A decrease in sodium intake would reduce the number of cases by 30% and could prevent between 10,000 and 16,000 deaths a year. These are alarming figures that require immediate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168550">Clearly, these preventable deaths, these cardiovascular diseases and this hypertension epidemic have a significant human cost. The main reason I support this bill is to prevent these human tragedies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168551">There is also an economic cost. A study found that, if Canadians reduced their personal sodium intake level to 1,500 mg per day, it would save our health care system an estimated $1.38 billion. Including indirect costs, these savings could reach $3 billion. By reducing our sodium intake, we could improve our health and save a significant amount of money. How can one oppose virtue?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168552">Many people are wondering about this topic and why we should have this strategy. Why not launch an awareness campaign so that Canadians stop adding salt to their food? The reason is simple: reducing salt added at the table will not solve the problem since 77% of the salt Canadians consume is from processed and prepackaged food. Salt from food in its original and natural form and salt added at the table represent only 23% of Canadians' daily sodium intake. We therefore have to make improvements in areas where it will have an impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168553">The bill's strategy is nothing new. The same strategy was proposed in 2010 by the sodium working group, which was put in place by this government in 2007. This working group was—it has since been dismantled by the minister—made up of representatives of the food processing and food service sectors, non-governmental organizations focused on health, scientific and consumer groups, health professional organizations and various government departments and agencies. It was a very inclusive group made up of all the key stakeholders in the field. This group came up with and recommended the strategy that was presented in 2010 and that is found in my colleague's bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168554">What measures will be taken as a result of this bill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168555">First of all, let us be clear. This bill will not take any products off the shelves. Products containing more sodium than the amount recommended by Health Canada will have to be clearly labelled. This will help consumers make healthier choices. No one will stop individuals from buying an item containing too much sodium. With this bill, consumers will simply be better informed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168556">I recently came across an issue of the publication put out by the Association francophone des parents du Nouveau-Brunswick. It had a two-page article on the problem of sodium in our food. The point I want to make here is that the article had a four-point sidebar on how to read labels to better understand them, particularly when it comes to sodium content. This example alone illustrates just how much we need a better, simpler labelling system that consumers can rely on in order to make informed choices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168557">Obviously, the voluntary approach that the government has espoused for the past 20 years is not working. Very few food companies have reduced the amount of salt in their foods, and Canadians' salt intake has not gone down. In Australia, a similar approach has actually resulted in a 9% increase in sodium intake rather than a decrease. A recently published American report found that, used alone, a voluntary approach was ineffective over a period of 40 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168558">I am sure that that is one of the reasons why many groups of health professionals and health experts support this bill and the need for a national sodium reduction strategy. Three of them are based in Quebec: the Quebec Coalition on Weight-Related Problems, the Council for Food Progress Initiatives, and Louise Vandelac, director of the UQAM's Institute of Environmental Sciences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168559">Also supporting this initiative are the Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Nurses Association, the Canadian Pharmacists Association and Public Health Physicians of Canada. These groups and associations are on the front lines. They see the devastating effects of high sodium intake, and they want to make sure that consumers have access to healthy food and information to help them make good choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168560">The World Health Organization has published several reports on the importance of reducing sodium intake. The 2012 United Nations report on food revealed that Canada was not doing enough to discourage the consumption of foods high in sodium.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168561">We have to do better for Canadians. These are simple measures recommended by the government's sodium working group, a group made up of representatives from many walks of life. There is no reason for the government not to take these simple and important measures to improve the health of Canadians. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3168562">Mr. Speaker, I have listened with interest to the other members who have spoke in the House and I agree with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, as does the government, that the average sodium intake in Canada is definitely higher than it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168563"> We are committed to the goal of lowering sodium intake from 3,400 milligrams per day to 2,300 milligrams per day by 2016. I am happy to report that early studies indicate that we are already on track toward reaching this goal without heavy-handed legislation or regulations. That is why I do not support this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168564">The Government of Canada currently takes a voluntary multi-stakeholder approach to sodium reduction, as recommended by the report, “Sodium Reduction Strategy for Canada”. Despite, the call from Bill <Document DbId="5806485" Type="4">C-460</Document> to implement this report, the bill does not follow the report's key recommendations. It fails to capitalize on the benefits of the current collaborative approach and would increase burden to industry through new legislative and regulatory measures. The bill may also pose risks to food safety and health and carries financial cost to government, industry and Canadians. The measures proposed in the bill ignore the shared responsibility in reducing sodium intake in Canada. For sodium reduction efforts to be effective, responsibility must be shared among Canadians, the food industry and federal, provincial and territorial governments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168565">Industry has accepted the challenge of reducing sodium levels, while maintaining food safety and consumer acceptance. In fact, industry has responded to the demands of Canadians and is putting more healthy choices onto the Canadian marketplace. We are already seeing positive progress toward meeting the sodium reduction targets. Data recently collected from a sample of breads, breakfast cereals and canned soup shows that sodium levels have been reduced by 10% overall in these product categories. This is one-third of the way to the 2016 goal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168566">The fact is that these early achievements have been made without the heavy-handed measures proposed by the bill. Why change things now? We are on the road to recovery, as it were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168567">As Canadians, we have a critical role as well. It is the responsibility of all of us as individuals to become aware of nutrition issues and what is in our food so we can take more informed choices when we are the grocery store, when we eat at home or when we eat out. However, health is not just about eating; it is also about exercise and fitness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168568">Finally, this government's role, along with provincial and territorial governments, is to help promote the healthier choice as the easiest choice for Canadians. We do this through a three pillar approach that includes awareness and education for Canadians, guidance to industry and research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168569">The Government of Canada's current approach to sodium reduction strikes the right balance and respects the responsibilities of all stakeholders. Let me describe some of the work that our government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168570">As members know, in 2010, our government launched the healthy eating awareness and education initiative to raise Canadians' awareness about the benefits of healthy eating. The goal is to help inform Canadians so they can choose a healthier choice. This initiative promotes plain language messages about healthy eating, sodium reduction and healthy weights for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168571">The first two years concentrated on the Nutrition Facts Education Campaign, with a focus on percent daily value. The percent daily value can help Canadians determine if a specific amount of food has a little or a lot of a nutrient, such as sodium. This government has used innovative ways to deliver this campaign with the collaboration of Food &amp; Consumer Products of Canada and its member companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168572"> Public opinion research results have shown an increase of 5% in the use of the nutrition facts table over a two-year period. In addition, almost half of those surveyed said that having nutritional information available had influenced the decisions they made when buying food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168573">The Eat Well Campaign was launched in September 2012 and includes messages on sodium reduction. Early findings show consistent positive indicators of intent to change behaviour. The Eat Well Campaign continues to work with the provinces and territories, non-governmental organizations, health professionals and retailers as we move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168574">This demonstrates that, while still in the early stages, the current approach is working. That is why this government continues to collaborate with various stakeholders and has done so recently to develop guidance to industry to reduce sodium in processed foods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168575">The Government of Canada released guidance for the food industry on reducing sodium in processed foods in June of 2012. The bill proposes that this guidance be put into regulation. This is unnecessary. Health Canada's guidance notes specific sodium level benchmarks for processed food categories. It is intended to serve as a guide for the food industry to reduce sodium in its products. This will help Canadians reach the 2016 average sodium intake goals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3168576">If passed, the bill would require that benchmark levels set out in the guidance become mandatory limits, with warnings on labels for any prepackaged foods that exceeded these levels. However, the benchmarks are based upon averages for entire food categories, such breads or cereals. They were not designed to apply to individual foods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168577">As a result, the requirement for labelling of individual products with warnings stating that the food does not meet Health Canada's sodium reduction targets would be misleading to Canadians and go against the intended purpose of such a label. Furthermore, the guidance cannot be put into regulation as it is simply not possible to enforce an average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168578">In addition, the bill does not take into consideration food safety or food categories such as prosciutto, which are not expected to follow guidance given the nature of the product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168579">Indeed, the bill would pose many challenges. While unintentional, implementing the bill may potentially have negative impacts on food safety and health; I repeat, negative impacts on food safety and health. Salt- and sodium-containing food additives play important roles in the preservation of numerous foods, such as processed meats and cheese.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168580">The bill's 90-day coming into force period would require a rapid reduction of sodium. The bill simply does not anticipate the food safety consequences that this could create. For products that cannot meet the sodium levels within the short timelines proposed by the bill, warning labels would be required. These warning labels could very well have negative health impacts that the bill, again, would not address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168581"> A warning label for sodium alone could be very misleading to Canadians. Sodium is not the only nutrient that needs to be considered when trying to make healthier choices. A product without a sodium warning label may be perceived as a healthy choice, but may not actually contain the nutrients required to support a healthy diet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168582">Warning labels on foods may not achieve the desired health benefits and may not be appropriate, as risk is not associated with consumption of a single food or nutrient but, rather, overall consumption patterns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168583">This government's approach has been to encourage healthy eating through positive messaging, awareness and education activities, as I have described, not through unnecessary and misleading warning labels. Almost all prepackaged foods already require a nutrition facts label that has nutrient information, including the amount of sodium preserving. This table gives Canadians the information they need to make informed choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168584">Finally, the bill would impose a considerable and unnecessary regulatory and administrative burden on the government and on industry. To illustrate, there are upwards of 100,000 prepackaged foods on the Canadian market, and each of these products would fall under the requirement to provide the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> with information on sodium content. A public registry would have to be established to communicate this information. This enforcement cost would be significant and would require new resources. The added compliance burden to industry would also be significant. This could result in costs being passed on to Canadians. In addition, it is unclear what the database would be used for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168585">As I stated earlier, a food low in sodium is not necessarily a healthy food. It would be inappropriate and misleading for people to use a registry that did not present the complete nutritional picture as a guide to healthy and unhealthy foods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168586">Multi-stakeholder efforts to reduce sodium intake in Canada are still in the early stages, and despite this, we are starting to see progress. It will take time for the food industry to adjust its products so they continue to be safe and acceptable to Canadians. While promoting sodium reduction is worthwhile, the bill fails to make the case for changing course now to take on such a heavy-headed expense of an unnecessary approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168587">For all of these reasons, I cannot support the bill. It is my belief that the majority of the House would agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168588">While it is well intentioned, I do not think that all the factual information has been examined. We do not want to take a heavy-handed approach. We want to do as we did with trans fats. We did this voluntary approach in trans fats. It worked. Now the trans fat issue looks very good compared to the way it looked before. We are doing the same thing with sodium intake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3168589">This is an issue that our government takes very seriously, but we want it to work out. We believe that this voluntary approach will work.</ParaText>
