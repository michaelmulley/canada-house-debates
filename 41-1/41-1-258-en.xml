              <ParaText id="3363108">Mr. Speaker, there is more than just honey that comes from honeybees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363109"> One of every three bites of food eaten worldwide depends on pollinators, especially honeybees. Many crops rely completely on them. In Canada, over $2 billion a year in agricultural production depends on honeybees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363110"> However, bees are dying and disappearing in record numbers. Pesticides, parasites and pathogens are killing one-third of all colonies each year, and it is getting worse. A threat to the honeybee is a threat to our food and to us all. Today is the day of the honeybee in 185 municipalities and 3 provinces, including Thunder Bay. I hope the members of this House will join me in supporting efforts to make May 29 our national day of the honeybee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363111">I invite Thunder Bay citizens to join me this Saturday for a day of honeybee celebrations at the Thunder Bay Country Market.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363112">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to emphasize the need for us all to work together to promote health and fitness for all Canadians. We are facing the terrible situation of raising the first generation of children who may not live as long as their parents will. That is why we need to improve our health level now and show our children that we can do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363113">This is one of the reasons that colleagues all around this House and I have worked together to create National Health and Fitness Day, the first Saturday in June, this year being June 1.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363114">Over the last few months, more than 40 towns and cities across Canada have proclaimed the day, including Pond Inlet, Yellowknife, Whistler, Calgary, Ottawa and Halifax. In Ottawa, there is a cycling event planned at city hall with national leaders. In Vancouver, we will have a run with Olympian Ashleigh McIvor and the Minister of Transport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363115">We also have the strong support of the Running Room and the Fitness Industry Council of Canada, which has encouraged over 500 private clubs across Canada to waive their drop-in fees for June 1.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363116">I thank all my colleagues, from all parties, who are promoting better health for all Canadians. It shows the next generation that we can work together to make Canada the fittest nation on earth.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3363117">Mr. Speaker, today is World MS Day. Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder that causes disability. Most diagnoses occur between the ages of 25 and 31, afflicting about twice as many women as men. It is not known what causes this disease, and as yet there is no cure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363118">MS puts hard demands on the health and income of family members acting as caregivers. There are three important changes that we could make to help people with MS and their caregivers stay in the workforce and ease their financial hardships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363119">Employment insurance sickness benefits should be made more flexible so people with MS and other disabilities can get support when and how they need it. The criteria for receiving disability credits and benefits should be eased to help people with MS and other disabilities to qualify because their health condition varies over time. Finally, disability and caregiver tax credits should be refundable to improve income support for caregivers, particularly those in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363120">These steps would help people with MS and their families cope better until a cure is found.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363121">Mr. Speaker, as the regressive clerical military dictatorship in Iran goes through its mockery of fair elections, a brutal crackdown has been unleashed. That is why many members are taking part in the Iran accountability week. We are shining the light of truth on what is happening inside Iran.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363122">I want to draw attention to a few such examples. First, Navid Khanjani, a Baha'i student, was denied the right to go to university because of his faith and was sentenced to 12 years of brutal imprisonment in Tehran's Evin prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363123">It reconfirms the wilful pattern of abuse by this regime. Members will recall that I spoke last year in the House about Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, a Christian pastor who has been sentenced to death for practising his faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363124">Another Christian pastor is also in jeopardy right now. Pastor Saeed Abedini is a dual American-Iranian citizen who was arrested, beaten and sentenced to eight years. His health is now deteriorating because of his beatings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363125">We renew our call on the regime to release Navid Khanjani, Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, and Pastor Saeed at once.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363126">Mr. Speaker, my warm, loving Somali community left a war-torn country to come to our peaceful country, only to have many of their children die at the hand of violence, often gun violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363127">Almost 50 young Somali-Canadian males have been killed in Ontario and Alberta since 2006. In 2012, between June and October, six of 33 Toronto shooting homicides befell Somali-Canadian men. That means the Somali community, making up less than 100,000 of Toronto's population, had 18% of the city's shooting deaths. Our Toronto Somali-Canadian community faces poverty, education challenges, job challenges, imported guns from the United States, and the overwhelming fear to report the violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363128">Our resilient Somali-Canadian community hopes the government will investigate these deaths, develop federal-provincial job programs supporting Somali-Canadians, develop job opportunities with the RCMP, and examine witness protection.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363135">Again, Canada has failed to protect its children. As legislators, we have a unique role to play and we need to find solutions. This means funding and promoting bullying prevention. It means working with the provinces, parents and young people to ensure that tragedies like these do not happen again. It means that a national bullying prevention strategy must be adopted. This is a duty we owe our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363136">On behalf of the NDP, I wish to extend my condolences to the Belley and Moldvan families as well as their loved ones. I promise that we will continue to work until Canada adopts a national bullying prevention strategy.</ParaText>

They deny it to this day. The tyranny of Ayatollah Ali Khomeyni showed no respect for democracy or human rights. The gangsters who carried out this brutal, deliberate massacre remain in powerful positions. We condemn these despicable crimes against humanity.</ParaText>

As a champion for reproductive justice and women's rights, he took our country forward. Thanks to Dr. Morgentaler's fight, a generation of Canadian women have had access to choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363160">Dr. Morgentaler was honoured with the Order of Canada for his tireless efforts for nearly half a century, putting his life and freedom at risk so that Canadian women could have access to safe abortion services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363161">Twenty-five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in his favour, declaring that women have the right to choose. Unfortunately, even today, access to reproductive services remains unequal. We must remain vigilant against repeated attempts to roll back these rights. New Democrats will continue Dr. Morgentaler's fight and the pursuit of equality.</ParaText>

The Liberal leader has known for weeks that a Liberal senator is hiding $1.7 million in an offshore bank account. This senator only remains in the Liberal caucus because of the Liberal leader's poor judgment. He is clearly in over his head.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363172">Mr. Speaker, last night both Conservative and Liberal senators feigned shock and horror to learn that Mike Duffy had been engaged in partisan politics while milking the Senate, but the reality is it is a time-honoured tradition. Lots of senators are full-time political operatives for their parties, with their salaries, their staff and their travel fully paid by the taxpayer. This has been going on for decades, but not a single Conservative or Liberal blew the whistle on any of these senators. Why would they? Just like there is no fix for an egg-sucking dog, once the senators got a taste for that juicy subsidy, there is no way to ever make them stop.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3363394">Mr. Speaker, it seems that your life is going to be easier starting on Monday. You will have just a little more peace and quiet in the House. A familiar voice you have occasionally had to call to order will no longer be here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363395">I rise before the House today with great emotion to address my fellow Canadians and my colleagues for the last time as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170231" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363396"> I am announcing my departure from federal political life as of June 2—16 years to the day from the first time the people of Bourassa gave me the privilege of representing them, a privilege they have given me on six consecutive occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363397"> I would like to express my appreciation to my constituents, who have placed their trust in me year after year, in good times and in hard times. Thanks as well to the members of my executive and the thousands of volunteers who made it possible for me to be here for all these years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363398"> I would also like to thank all of my staff—Maurice, Joe, Lise, Sylvia and Rolande—who have always served the people of Bourassa with the greatest professionalism in both Ottawa and Montréal-Nord. Not only did they carry out their duties, but they did so with enormous sensitivity and effectiveness in the most difficult cases. People often come to us as a last resort, and believe me, my staff worked miracles. Thank you, my friends. Thank you, Maurice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363399"> Obviously, 30 years in federal politics and 16 years as a member have forced my family to make many sacrifices. To my wife, Chantale, and my children, Geneviève and Alexandre, go all my appreciation and gratitude for their understanding and sacrifice. I thank my family for always being there for me. I am sorry that I was not always with you, but know that I love you beyond measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363400"> I would also like to take this opportunity to wish a happy birthday to my mother, Lucie, who is watching us today. Happy birthday, Mom. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for being here with us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363401">I would like to thank and salute my colleagues in caucus and on both sides of the House. It has been a privilege to work next to them. Of course, we have had fights a few times because we do not understand each other or they do not understand my French expressions. Nevertheless, it has been a privilege to sit with them.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363402"> Thanks also to the House of Commons employees, and the security guards whom I greeted every morning. They have all my respect. Thanks to the pages, the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Clerk and her staff and the other officers of Parliament. My gratitude goes also to the House interpreters—we do not call them translators, we call them interpreters—for their courage, professionalism and determination as they tried to understand the homegrown expressions I used in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363403"><B> Some hon. members:</B> Bravo!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363404"><B>Mr. Denis Coderre: </B> And well we should applaud them. They must have had smoke coming out their ears at times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363405"> I have enjoyed sitting in the House of Commons, whether as a member or as a minister. I would also particularly like to thank the Right Hon. Jean Chrétien, who allowed me to make a real difference in the world of sport in Canada and to stand up for our country’s values at Citizenship and Immigration, especially after the events of September 11. I also want to thank former prime minister Paul Martin for appointing me to the position of minister for La Francophonie and special adviser for Haiti.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363406"> I am especially proud to have negotiated the agreement to bring the World Anti-Doping Agency to Montreal, to have created a meaningful policy on sport in Canada and to have assisted our Olympic and Paralympic athletes and their coaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363407"> I am proud to have taken action to ensure respect for the languages spoken by all of our athletes, be they anglophone or francophone. Thanks to the body that came to be known as the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada, athletes are no longer at the mercy of their federations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363408"> In immigration, the agreements I signed made regionalizing immigration a priority. I salute my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363409">The one I am the most pleased with was the one we signed with Manitoba. This was a historical agreement that allowed Manitoba to pick up its own immigrants. It was good for the economy and the people.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363410"> I promoted francophone immigration across the country, simplified the points system and started major debates on issues such as creating a national identity card and using biometric data offline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363411"> Since I have been sitting in the House for 16 years now, I will take the liberty of sending a few messages to the government and to my colleagues as a whole, regardless of political party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363412"> Canada is a magnificent country, and its wealth derives from its diversity, from its variety. Let us never forget that Canada has two official languages and that no one should be considered a second-class citizen. French exists across the country, and the Government of Canada must ensure by its actions that francophones are respected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363413">It also means that judges of the Supreme Court should be bilingual. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363414"> Multiculturalism is an important Canadian value, and we should never have to choose between that value and bilingualism. They are two complementary values that must not be forced to compete with each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363415"> Let us respect the public service and stop using it as a scapegoat or cannon fodder. Public service employees do an incredible job. They are professionals and part of the solution.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363435">Since he was first elected, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170231" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> has had many roles. I had the opportunity to work with him when he was an MP, and also when he was minister and secretary of state. I also had the honour to work alongside him at meetings of the Standing Committee on Official Languages and during parliamentary trips. Official languages are very important to the member, and he cares a lot about ensuring that people who speak either language can access government services in both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363436">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170231" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> is known for being outspoken, passionate and dedicated, for having integrity and, of course, for being an active tweeter.

              <ParaText id="3363437">He was always available and always jumped wholeheartedly into his work. I will always remember the young hockey player—I am sure he does too—from the Acadie-Bathurst Titan. He had visa problems and could not join his team in Bathurst. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170231" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> was the citizenship and immigration minister at the time. He put his whole team to work on the issue. I remember it well. The morning of December 25, Christmas Day, I got a call saying that the issue was resolved and that the young hockey player was able to return to the country that very day and continue playing. What a great Christmas present for the Acadie-Bathurst Titan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363441"> At that time, in the late 1980s, I was a young professor. I had a quiet class; the students were studious and they listened. All of a sudden, we were joined by a student who was feisty and who could not be ignored, and the class was turned upside down. Half of the students supported him; the other half did not. He had an opinion on everything and, on top of that, he was a good student. When he came to my office, he never came alone. He always had his gang with him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363442"> I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, that they were federalists, and it was not because of me—I never discussed politics at the university, never—but because of him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363443"> I am telling this part of the story to explain that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170231" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> did not choose politics; politics chose him.

              <ParaText id="3363447">He is a man of sharp contrasts: both strong and whole, but also attentive and compassionate; he works like the devil, but he is exuberant and a good friend; colourful, but cultured, even though he tries to hide it. He is committed, which is why he works so hard. He has the courage of his convictions; he is not pushy, but he is persuasive. He is a formidable politician. He is close to people, a populist in the best sense of the word, but at the same time he is a man of principle. I have never known him to shy away from an issue. As he says himself, he is judicious and hard-hitting. He listens, but once he has heard the facts, he will stir things up, as he did with sport and immigration and in all his other areas of responsibility.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363486">We call this “droit de suite”, which originated in many countries throughout Europe, and right now we hope to bring it to our country. It is an artist's resale right. When one makes an original piece of art and sell it, one gets the full benefit, but in subsequent sales the value of it may increase substantially but the original artist does not see any benefit from that. That is what the bill hopes to correct. In 70 countries around the world, they have recognized this special right, this resale right for artists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363487">Currently there are people who are destitute and poor and they are selling their artwork in the streets for $20, $10, $15. Meanwhile, the art they had produced many years prior is selling in art galleries for thousands of dollars. They see nothing of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363488">Musical artists and other people do receive great benefits from their prior work, but artists do not. I had the honour of travelling to the convention this weekend to talk about this.</ParaText>

I hope that the House will adopt this necessary measure for the artists of our nation in order for them to receive compensation for their hard work and their vision. I thank all members in the House for hearing me and also thank my colleague for helping me do the bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363542">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a very specific point of order with regard to Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 21, 2013 and other measures, and the work that was done by the committees that were studying this bill, particularly the finance committee, which invoked some measures we believe are not in order and fell well outside of its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363543">As some context for those Canadians who are not familiar with Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, this is another piece of omnibus legislation. We rose earlier on similar points of order with respect to how the bill was handled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363544">In its nature, being an omnibus bill under the current government's watch, with the expansion of omnibus legislation to include so many different matters, the government has faced a difficulty of its own making in that it is not purely a financial bill and it is not simply a bill to implement the budget; it would do much more. While it has an anti-democratic nature and tone for us, in various ways we have struggled with the ability for members of Parliament to properly study and amend legislation that is so broad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363545">I wish that you would review the motion adopted by the standing committee on May 7, as well as the proceedings that resulted from this specific motion, and that you rule to determine whether these proceedings were in order or not and whether the committee overstepped its authority when adopting this particular motion. I will refer in detail to what the motion accomplished and how it fell outside of the mandate of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363546">We raised a very similar point of order, if you will remember, around Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>. That was the second omnibus bill that followed on Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>. We had deep concerns about the fact that the Standing Committee on Finance, during its consideration of that massive omnibus bill, went beyond its mandate and usurped the authority of the House when it invited other standing committees to study particular sections of Bill C-45. On their own mandate they started to carve the bill up and send it out. It then allowed these committees that were studying the bill to move amendments and then saw it as if those amendments had been moved by members of the finance committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363547">We argued at the time that this went beyond the mandate and the reference from the House, from you as the Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363548">A similar argument could be made about Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>. It was introduced on April 29.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363549"> On May 7, after the government used time allocation to shut down the debate once again on discussions at second reading, it ended with the passage of the following motion, which stated:</ParaText>

                <Quote>

              <ParaText id="3363553">It is pro forma and it is how bills are referred to the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363554">The committee acted outside of its powers and authority, those powers conferred on it by this House, when it adopted a motion on that very same day asking other committees to study sections of the bill, namely the standing committees on industry, science and technology; veterans affairs; human resources, skills and development; the status of persons with disabilities; citizenship and immigration; as well as foreign affairs and international development. That is where the government sought to parse out the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363555">It is very difficult to deal with omnibus legislation that is so obviously varied that it implicates so many different committees. The government has pushed, and I would argue broken the democratic limits of our legislature, by packing so much into these individual bills. In essence it is hiding from Canadians what its agenda is as these bills then come back to the House for one single vote on so many matters. This was something that the Conservatives concerned themselves with greatly when they were in opposition. You have heard me mention many of the quotes from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and various ministers in his cabinet on how much they disliked this tactic when the Liberals used it. It is now a tactic that the Conservatives seem to enjoy using with much relish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363556">Although I believe the Standing Committee on Finance went beyond its mandate to ask these five other committees to study the bill, this is not the principal concern that I want to raise with you today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363557">The committee went even further this time in going beyond its mandate, by adopting a motion to allow members of Parliament who are not members of a caucus represented on the committee to file amendments to the bill. It went further by directing that any amendments suggested to the committee would be deemed to be proposed during the clause-by-clause consideration on Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, even if the member who presented the amendment was not present.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3363558">Let us take a moment with this. Out of some seeking of convenience, the committee members passed the motion at their own discretion, not by any power given to them by the House, to allow amendments that came from people who do not sit on the committee, who are not recognized parties in the House. They allowed amendments to suddenly appear and be presented as if they came from somebody on committee. This goes against three fundamental principles that we hold dear in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363559">Only the House can appoint committee members. This is well known. It is done at the beginning of every session when we constitute our committees. No committee can self-appoint members. It has to come from an order in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363560">Only committee members who have been appointed by the House can move a motion. In order to move a motion, a member must be present at the time the motion is moved. We just dealt with a piece of private member's legislation before my point of order. A seconder was missing from her particular seat. The House properly waited until that member took her seat so that she was present. Motions cannot be moved if people are not here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363561">The rules of committee as established by the House specifically prescribe that members of a committee are designated by the House and cannot include members of a non-recognized party. This is a practice and a procedure we have used for many years. The rules established by the House also specifically prescribe that only a member of a committee can move a motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363571">I would like at this point to mention your ruling, Mr. Speaker, from last December. You will recall that at the time, we moved our point of order regarding the last omnibus bill, Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, specifically with respect to the role and rights of independent members in the context of report stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363572">The <Affiliation DbId="170693" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> argued that the current process by which independent members are not allowed to present motions at committee means that at report stage of bills, a single independent member has the ability, in his words, “to hold the House hostage in a voting marathon”, as if voting were somehow connected to a hostage-taking, by submitting numerous report stage amendments.</ParaText>

However, I believe that the Conservatives fundamentally misinterpreted your ruling to in fact allow independent members to move motions to amend bills at committees. The Conservatives should have, and must have, sought agreement of the House to allow the members to sit on that committee. That is a power they cannot take away simply by a motion at committee. Indeed, it is from the House that committees derive this power. Committees on their own do not have absolute powers.</ParaText>

In this case, the committee did exactly that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363619">As a result of that, there is an expanded ability of independent members of Parliament to participate at the committee stage of the process.

We think that is an appropriate response to the invitation the Speaker provided specifically on bills of this nature, on the processes that we have in place. For that reason, it is one that should be encouraged and rewarded. It is four square within the direction your ruling set out and the invitation you provided, Mr. Speaker, and, as such, I see no fault in the process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363621">Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I have had the opportunity to go over some of the things that took place in committee, and we should be concerned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363622">When the government House leader talks about the evolution of process, what we have witnessed is an evolution that takes away the ability of individual members to perform their duties on numerous occasions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363623">For example, the government House leader could argue that the usage of time allocation is an evolution of process. That evolution that the government has adopted works against, what we would argue, the best interests of Canadians in limiting the opportunity for individuals to express themselves on a wide variety of bills, including Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363624">Let us take a look at what the government has now proposed to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363625">The Conservatives are saying that inside the committee they now want to mandate all members of the House, whether they are part of an officially recognized party or not, to bring forward their amendments to the committee well in advance. However, as one can easily imagine by the way the government has managed this evolution of process, the Conservatives are really trying to prevent independent members who are not part of a recognized political party the opportunity to present their amendments at report stage. This raises a whole spectrum of issues that really needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363626">I am concerned that if the government were trying to demonstrate good will based on a Speaker's ruling, with all due respect, then this should have been was raised at one of the House leader's meetings and received a consensus of support. We have to be very careful when we look at changing rules, which is ultimately what the government House leader has proposed to do. We have to be very careful that there is a consensus from all political entities inside the House to do that. If we take a look at what took place at the committee, members will find that there was not unanimous consent in passing the motion in question, which is important to recognize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363627">The second issue I would like to raise is the letter that I understand the leader of the Green Party received. Imagine receiving a letter which gives a very clear indication that one has <I>x</I> amount of time to get all of one's information gathered and amendments in place. The letter suggests that must be done by Monday, May 27, at nine o'clock in the morning. Again, I call into question the legitimacy of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363628">This issue came up through a point of order by the New Democratic opposition House leader, and there is great merit for that. We will take a look at this matter in more detail and we might want to add further comment on the issue as time progresses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363629"> However, I want to emphasize how important it is when the government House leader makes reference to the evolution of process or rules. Whenever he starts to fantasize or talk about it, in the past, it has not been a positive thing in democracy in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363630">I raise this issue as a red flag. We need to tread very carefully before making any sort of ruling on that which seeks to deprive individual members, or collective members, the opportunity to do something they have done in the past because the government deems it as not as clean or quick as it would like to see things take place. The Conservatives are bringing in these draconian-type changes or proposals, which are not healthy for democracy in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

I will reserve the right to add more arguments later because we were not aware that this point of order would be raised today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363632">With great respect, Mr. Speaker, the ruling you made in December 2012 reminds me of what happened in 2001 when your predecessor, Speaker Milliken, also made a ruling that restricted the use of report stage amendments. Between 1968 and 2001, successive Speakers were rather flexible with regard to report stage amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363633"> In your ruling, you asked the government to show some openness to participation by members from non-recognized parties or independent members in certain committees, enabling them to propose amendments in committee. There is an important distinction, Mr. Speaker, and you are well placed to be aware of it. The Conservatives also know this, because in 1993 they were a non-recognized party. The NDP knows it too, because the NDP was also a non-recognized party in 1993. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363634"> The problem is that the members of this House fall into two categories. In the House we have an opportunity to ask questions and make speeches. We even have some speaking rights, which unfortunately we can no longer exercise because the government has been imposing time allocation motions on nearly all bills. Still, we feel we have proportional equality with our counterparts in the other parties. It is natural that we will be allocated fewer minutes because we have fewer members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363635"> In committee, on the other hand, it is not the same as in the Quebec National Assembly, where the other parties have given the non-recognized parties—such as Québec solidaire and Action démocratique before it—the right to sit on committees, speak at committee meetings and even vote. Here, none of that is possible. I do not want the non-recognized parties to be treated like a ping pong ball in this dispute between the government and the recognized parties in this House. I think we have something to say on the subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363636"> The existence of the report stage simply allows us to propose the amendments we were unable to propose in committee, the amendments we have not had an opportunity to discuss. It is the only right we have left, Mr. Speaker, and I would like you to preserve it. We must be careful. The government says this is an invitation, but no party in the House has given us anything since May 2, 2011, and we are not asking for any gifts. We do not want additional privileges; we simply want our rights to be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363637"> In committee, however, as happened in the committee studying Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, the only committee where we have been able to propose amendments, we had a few short minutes to do so, but no opportunity to speak at all. We were not allowed to ask questions of the public servants who were present or vote on the amendments we were proposing. If the government thinks it was giving us a gift, it is mistaken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363638"> We want to preserve our rights. Therefore, we must be able to propose an amendment, discuss it, debate it and vote on it, and be aware of all committee activities, as it is possible to do in the House at report stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363639"> My first request, Mr. Speaker, is that you ensure that the rights of all members of the House are preserved, especially those who are less numerous, like the members of non-recognized parties.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3363648">Mr. Speaker, I have two very small points. I appreciate the new-found passion that the Conservatives have for independent members, because we can recall that when an independent member's bill was at committee, the Conservatives were gutting that very same legislation and denied her the ability to even address her own piece of legislation, claiming the very rules that we are talking about here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363649">My specific point, and I am not sure if my hon. colleague was present for the entire citation that I used, is that the main argument that we used is if this is the remedy by which the government seeks to satisfy the involvement of independent members at the committee stage, that is a remedy that can be sought, but the power rests here with the House of Commons. It simply does not rest with the committee to invent the power to appoint or adopt motions from members who are not part of a committee. That is a fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363650">The committee itself is a creation of the House of Commons. The members who are involved in that committee and any standing members who may be a part of it come from here, not come from any chair or from any motion that has passed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363651">In his response—and I know he is going to come back and deliberate further on the points that we raised—my hon. colleague needs to address this specific point, because it is the argument that we are making to you, Mr. Speaker. The argument is that the committee has the powers that are vested to it from the House of Commons. It is exclusive of that power to just invent who gets to sit on that committee. To suddenly invite amendments from members who are not there is also exclusive of that power. We cannot move motions of people who are not present. That is a fact. It is true here and it is true at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363652">I do not see why the <Affiliation DbId="170693" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> has such a problem understanding that, other than that he has found some convenient article. If the government chooses to do it this way, it can, but it has to come from here. For goodness' sake, let us protect some of the privileges and powers of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363653">The instruction from the House of Commons did not allow the committee to do that. It did not. I read out the citation and reference to the committee. It did not say that the committee chair can suddenly appoint whomever they like and take whatever amendments they like. It did not. It is in black and white. If my hon. colleague across the way would like me to read it to him, I can. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363654">The fact of the matter is that the power rests with you, Mr. Speaker, as you refer a bill, and it rests with the House in designating which committees are instructed to study the bill, and how. How the committee does everything beyond that is its business, and we respect that right, of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363655">However, to ignore the central point of our argument today in this point of order means either there is no counter-argument or they are going to search around for one for a couple of days. Obviously the decision rests with you, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate the comments from my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

The House was able to share new-found compassion across the political spectrum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363665">In all seriousness, there is frustration and confusion around this recent closure motion that has been invoked today. The government has left the category of feeling shameful about shutting down debate in the House of Commons and usurping our democratic rights and now does it with a certain glee and excitement, even on bills that the opposition has talked to the government about agreeing with and about agreeing to limit the number of speakers so that we can move through the legislation in a proper way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363666">Conservatives are pushing an open door now. They are saying that the opposition is in their way, that they cannot get their jobs done and they have to invoke closure again and that it is so tragic. They seem to take some sort of joy out of further shattering the record of any government in Canadian history for shutting down debate in Parliament. There is no prize for this. They do not get an extra set of balloons for having broken the record so badly. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363705">The bill would change the rules, but that would help shippers have an agreement with rail companies, and that is very important for shippers. They have been asking for that for years. That is why we have to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363706">The goal of this legislation is to encourage railways and shippers to work together. Shippers will have the right to a service agreement with railways to enhance clarity, predictability and reliability in rail service. The bill would help shippers manage and expand their businesses, while ensuring the railway operates an efficient network for the benefit of all users. A strong, competitive rail freight supply chain is vital to Canada's economy as a whole and the challenging global economy. All sectors of the economy must work together to drive growth, job creation and long-term prosperity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363726"> I had the honour of experiencing a by-election in 2007 and the general elections in 2008 and 2011.

Indeed, elections may have had an impact on the progress of certain business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363727"> Nevertheless, since the NDP members agree on the bill, they will still agree even if we debate it for several more hours. That is what the hon. member just said. We believe it is time to move on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363728"> However, at the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, they talked about the ideological struggle to abolish the Canadian Wheat Board, the degree of difficulty experienced by heavy-duty trucks between -40 <Sup>o</Sup>C and 40 <Sup>o</Sup>C, our government's inaction on railway security measures, cuts at VIA Rail Canada, opposition to the introduction of rail service, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363729"> I have four pages of similar topics that they discussed and that were not necessarily related to the bill being discussed in committee. When time is allotted to us, we should use it to address the proper subjects and to advance arguments that relate to them at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363730"> At the committee meetings regarding Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, we discussed a range of subjects. I can name others: the potential risks associated with the transport of bitumen by pipeline, the national transit strategy, the closing of rail lines between Gaspé and Chandler, and so on. I have four pages of subjects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363731"> If the relevance of the topic at the time we discuss it is so important to them, they should have set an example in committee.

We had many discussions and I would remind the House that, at the request of the official opposition, we talked about the major environmental concerns surrounding greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles even though we were talking about the railway.

When we are dealing with something as important for our country's economy as allowing shippers to have agreements with Canadian railway companies—which they have been asking for for years—why do they not talk about that topic in particular?

They are the ones who have delayed for seven years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363760">Then, when we bring many reasoned amendments forward to the committee, the Conservatives ignore them because they do not want to hear from the opposition. They do not want to hear from Canadians. Of course they bring up a list of people who are supporting the bill. All the Conservatives have done is throw them a bone.

The propane industry is pleased to support the Fair Rail Freight Service Act.

              <ParaText id="3363789">Mr. Speaker, now that everybody is listening carefully, I am saying that we are discussing a bill that we should normally not have to discuss, something that has been taken for granted and that Canadians thought was done already. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363790"> The obligation for officers of Parliament to be bilingual and to speak Canada's two official languages is something that seemed self-evident until this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a unilingual Auditor General. That was a shock. The party to which I belong reacted so strongly that it refused to vote in favour of the appointment of that Auditor General. We left the House without even voting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363791"> I would like to thank my colleague for preparing this bill, which we of course support and which will ensure that officers of Parliament are required by law to be bilingual at the time of their appointment. It made no sense to take them on as unilinguals and to say that they would learn the other official language on the job, while working. That would mean learning French because we know very well that a unilingual francophone will never be appointed. They will appoint unilingual anglophones and say that this is not a problem because the appointees will learn French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363792"> It is insulting to tell Canadians that the incumbents of such crucially important positions will be asked to devote considerable time and effort to learning a language when they are over 40 or 50 years of age. They have better things to do. They must be able to understand both official languages at the time of their appointment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363793"> The reasons for that are obvious. First, the role of an officer of Parliament, whether that of auditor general or another officer such as the commissioner of official languages, is to be able to speak with parliamentarians, to discuss matters with them and to understand them and make themselves understood.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363794">Many of my colleagues are unilingual. To be elected in Canada, people do not need to be bilingual. They only need to convince voters that they are the best candidate. It is very important to be understood when speaking to, let us say, the Auditor General, and to understand what the Auditor General has to say. Since MPs are at the service of Parliament, they should be able to be understood by all parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363795"> That is the first reason. The second reason is that, in order to make decisions, officers of Parliament must read a large amount of information that comes to them from across Canada, including from Quebec, New Brunswick and many places in Canada where information is in French. How can they understand that information on their own if they cannot read it on their own? They need that information to make decisions. Competency includes the ability to read in both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363796"> The third reason is that the office in question, like the Office of the Auditor General, must also be able to work in both official languages. However, if the head of that office is a unilingual anglophone, everything will be done in English. The person at the top must therefore be able to understand both languages so that the office can operate in both languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363797"> There is another essential reason. The auditor general and the other officers of Parliament are not mere bureaucrats, but rather communicators. They must communicate their information to Canadians. Nuanced communication is not possible if they cannot speak to Canadians in both languages. I can say that the entire saga leading up to the sponsorship scandal would have been entirely different if the auditor general at the time had been unable to speak French, and I say that having experienced the event first-hand.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363798">The other reason that the Auditor General and other officers of Parliament should be bilingual is to send the right message to the youth of our country. If they have ambition and want access to all the responsibilities of their country, they should learn the two official languages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363799">It is key for people to do that when they are 18 years old because it will be much more difficult when they are aged 48. When they will perhaps want access to these responsibilities, it may be too late. We need to send this message now, through this bill. It is key to shaping our country and the ability for Canada to pay tribute to its two official languages. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3363800">It is an incredible asset for us to have two official languages that are international languages. We need to be sure that it will be part of our future. We need to send a message that the most important responsibility, including yours, Mr. Speaker, is to be able to address fellow Canadians in the two official languages.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363801"> The Conservative government finally agreed to accept these arguments, and we are glad of that. I think it is important to emphasize that here where we are all together. It was not easy. They proposed amendments, but those amendments will not prevent us from voting in favour of the bill. Still, I would like to take this opportunity to say that those amendments were not useful. They added nothing very positive. They actually weakened the obligation to be bilingual. It has been weakened, but I think it is still strong enough. The ability to speak and understand both official languages well is a prerequisite for appointment. That will do; we can live with it. The bill is still “votable” despite the amendments that weaken it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363802"> The Conservatives also eliminated clause 3, which provided that the Governor in Council could, by order, add offices to the list established in clause 2. In that way, the government could have added to the list of offices for which bilingualism would be mandatory, without returning to Parliament. A belief in bilingualism is a belief in making it more widespread. The government did not want to give itself that power; it wants to come back to Parliament. That does not change much in the end, because if a government really wanted to add more offices, it could come to Parliament and make a convincing argument. If it did not want to, no law could make it do that. Thus, it is not a useful amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363803"> With another amendment, the governing party also eliminated clause 4 concerning interim appointments to the offices mentioned in Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document>. This clause read:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363804">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In the event of the absence or incapacity of the incumbent of any of the offices listed in section 2 or vacancy in any of these offices, the person appointed in the interim must meet the requirements set out in section 2 [that is, the bilingualism requirements].</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363805"> We know what the Conservatives are trying to do, but they will not succeed. Once this bill has been passed by the House of Commons and the Senate, there will be no way to exempt any interim office holder from the law. According to the law, the interim incumbent must be bilingual. When a Canadian is given such a serious responsibility, whether permanently or temporarily, that person must meet the requirements set out in the law. If the law requires an auditor general to be bilingual, then an interim auditor general must also be bilingual. If the government were to defy this law, it would be defying common sense and leaving itself open to legal action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363806"> Thus, despite these efforts by the Conservatives, this is still a good bill. I implore the government not to play games. We are ready to send it to the Senate quickly. I have talked with my Senate colleagues; they are ready to proceed quickly. The bill will be voted on in the House and sent to the Senate. The Senate will look at it carefully, as senators always do, but they can do it quickly. They must ensure that this bill becomes law and does not fall into limbo when the government decides to prorogue the House in an attempt to revive its moribund government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363809">As I said, I am very proud to support Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document>, which is designed to ensure that the 10 officers of Parliament are bilingual.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363810">Having been raised in a perfectly bilingual military family, I have always cherished both official languages. I grew up watching both <I>Passe-Partout</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>, and learning both French and English at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363811">At a very early age, I was taught the importance of bilingualism in Canada as a way to better understand two of our founding nations and their culture. I was also taught that speaking both of Canada's official languages would offer me better employment opportunities, especially if I wanted to work in the public sector. Therefore, I have always believed that it was an essential prerequisite for the highest-ranking public servants to master both official languages in order to be appointed to such important positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363812">When I was a parliamentary guide here in 2007, it was a point of pride for me to point out to visitors from other countries that bilingualism was a prerequisite for our highest-ranking public servants as a proof of the importance that was given to bilingualism in Canada.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363813">Unfortunately, as has often been the case since I became a federal MP, the Conservative government has denied that basic principle since winning majority status. It appointed a unilingual English Auditor General who is still not able to respond to questions in French during press conferences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363814">Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> aims to fill a major gap in the current legislative framework, and that gap was made obvious with the Conservatives' ill-advised appointment. This bill also clarifies the language obligations of the 10 officers of Parliament. Given that their functions and roles require them to interact with parliamentarians and Canadians, they must be able to communicate with parliamentarians and Canadians in the official language of their audience's choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363815">It was insinuated, in committee and elsewhere, that we were trying to violate the language rights of officers of Parliament, but that is clearly not the case with Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document>. In fact, there is nothing keeping an officer of Parliament, such as the auditor general, from conducting a press conference entirely in English. The important part is that they be able to respond to questions in French when necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363816">We are not trying to deny officers of Parliament the right to work in French. On the contrary, we are trying to guarantee the language rights of every Canadian. It is a matter of respect for all Canadians, whether they live in a minority language situation or not, and respect for the MPs they elected to represent them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363817">As a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, I had the opportunity to study my colleague's bill in detail and I saw the merits of it. I understood the need for this bill. The original version of it was excellent. It responded directly to the concerns raised by the appointment of the current Auditor General, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363818">This bill received support from members of all parties represented in the House. Unfortunately, at committee stage, the bill was butchered. The committee's Conservative majority did everything in its power to limit the scope of the bill, going so far as to insinuate that the NDP was trying to institute measures that would discriminate against the hard of hearing. I have heard it all since I have been in Parliament. They also eliminated the preamble of the bill, which provided the definition of officer of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363819">Without that part of the bill, this concept remains rather vague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363820">The Conservatives also removed any mention of the fact that the Constitution recognizes French and English as Canada's two official languages that receive equal privileges in Parliament. They removed that. This is not something controversial. This should be common knowledge for everyone in the House, regardless of their party or whether they are unilingual or not. That was not the issue. I thought it was a real shame that the Conservatives did not want to include these fundamental principles in the final version of Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363821">Quite honestly, when we look at their record when it comes to official languages, especially when it comes to defending the French fact and the French language in Canada, we are hardly surprised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363822">Consider the appointment of a unilingual anglophone Auditor General. We spoke about that in the House. The government promised that, in less than a year, Mr. Ferguson would have a sufficient mastery of the French language to at least be able to answer questions. That is still not the case today. It was truly unrealistic to make such a promise given the scope of the Auditor General's duties. It was absolutely illogical and inconceivable to think that, in just one short year, he could gain a sufficient mastery of the language of Molière to be able to answer people's questions and interact with them without the help of an interpreter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363823">Consider also the appointment of unilingual anglophone judges to the Supreme Court. For years, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170451" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> has been fighting to try to change the law and ensure that, even in the Supreme Court, people can really choose the language in which they want to interact. They can make that choice now, but there is no guarantee that the judges present will understand everything and that these people will truly receive equal treatment. They may receive less time to plead their case because the interpreters need time to do their job. Judges who do not have a good knowledge of French may not be able to grasp the subtleties in the documentary evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363824">We have here a host of problems that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170451" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> and other members of the NDP have been trying to resolve for years. We are faced with the same situation today: judges appointed to the Supreme Court do not understand French, not even the most basic French. This is problematic, and this government has an unbroken record of inaction in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363825">Another example is the closure of the Maurice Lamontagne Institute library, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans' only French library. This government shut down the library just to save a few bucks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363826">When we look at the different decisions this government has made, we unfortunately get the impression that French represents additional costs for Canadian taxpayers and that it is not necessarily considered a fundamental value or foundational principle of Canada. French is seen as a constraint and an obstacle to overcome, rather than “the language of ambition”, as the Commissioner of Official Languages so eloquently described it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363827">I want to get back to the closure of the Quebec City maritime search and rescue centre. There are some rumours in the papers that the government has apparently decided to reverse its decision to close the centre, but it still refuses to confirm that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363828">We tried to raise the issue several times at the Standing Committee on Official Languages. We moved some motions. When the Commissioner of Official Languages appeared the last time, we even asked a number of questions about this issue. The commissioner completely agrees with the NDP that the government must guarantee bilingual services at the Halifax and Trenton centres. That is not currently the case. Both the Auditor General and the Commissioner of Official Languages illustrated that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363829">However, to save a few million dollars, the government is prepared to jeopardize the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people who use the St. Lawrence and who have the misfortune of being francophones in this country. That is really too bad, but it reflects the attitude we saw in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363830">Although the government was reluctant, we managed to keep the essence, the spirit of the bill. We are proud of that. Once again, I want to congratulate my colleague for working so hard and for being patient while working with members from all the parties. I am not always patient, so I admire that a lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363831">The NDP has always been firmly committed to protecting the language rights of Quebeckers and all Canadians.</ParaText>

My father's family is anglophone and has lived in Scarborough for over 90 years, while my mother comes from a francophone family from Sherbrooke and Montreal. When I was young, living in Toronto, I was very fortunate to get my education at the Petit Chaperon Rouge francophone daycare, the Georges-Étienne Cartier Catholic elementary school and the Bishop de Charbonnel Catholic high school.

              <ParaText id="3363839">As a fluently bilingual franco-Ontarian with deep familial roots in Quebec, my support for the bill is partly technical and partly personal.

              <ParaText id="3363840">When I was a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages after being elected in 2011, I had the distinct honour of working with Mr. Graham Fraser, the Commissioner for Official Languages here in Canada. I developed a strong respect for Mr. Fraser in his view about official languages. His testimony in particular about the bill at committee was very important and provided a very important summary of the bill. He said:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Bill C-419, which was put forward by the New Democratic MP for Louis-Saint-Laurent, is to the point and unequivocal. Its purpose is to ensure that persons whose appointment requires the approval by resolution of the Senate, House of Commons, or both Houses of Parliament, can understand and express themselves clearly in both official languages without the aid of an interpreter from the moment they are appointed. It is an important bill for the future of Canada's linguistic duality. I therefore support it unconditionally.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363842">The bill is a response to the controversy caused by the Conservative appointment of a unilingual Auditor General in November 2011. While the notice of vacancy clearly indicated that proficiency in both official languages was an essential requirement to the position, the Conservative government sadly ignored this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363843">Given the protection of language rights embedded in the Constitution and the long history of custom and tradition, it is very unfortunate and disappointing that this type of bill is even necessary. However, the appointment of the unilingual Auditor General for Canada seemed to indicate the Conservative government's willingness to ignore our rights and traditions and roll back our official language rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363844">We cannot let this happen. As parliamentarians we must do everything we can to protect our language rights when they are threatened. For that reason I thank in particular the member for <Affiliation DbId="170255" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> for bringing the bill forward and for getting support from all parties to ensure that kind of situation never happens again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363845">The bill helped tremendously in that effort. The bill of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170255" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> clearly seeks to clarify the linguistic requirements for officers of Parliament to ensure that this type of situation does not happen again. It is a question of respecting the linguistic rights of Canadians and the members who represent them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363846">Officers of Parliament must be able to communicate with members of the Senate and the House of Commons as well as Canadians in the official language of their choice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363847">The bill, when adopted, would ensure that future holders of the ten following positions should understand both French and English without the assistance of an interpreter, and be able to express themselves clearly in both official languages when they take office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363848">It recognized that fluency in both official languages is essential for anyone holding the following positions. Unfortunately, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170119" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> mentioned, there were some changes at committee that added a bit of nuance or a lack of clarity in the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363849">The 10 positions that we are speaking of as officers of Parliament are: the Auditor General of Canada; the Chief Electoral Officer; the Commissioner of Official Languages for Canada; the Privacy Commissioner; the Information Commissioner; the Senate Ethics Officer; the Conflicts of Interest and Ethics Commissioner; the Commissioner of Lobbying; the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner; and the President of the Public Service Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363850">Each of the above offices was created under legislation that specified, among other things, the terms of employment and the nature of the office's relationship with Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363851">In my opinion, all of the positions I have just mentioned are officers of parliament. This is important, because officers of Parliament must work closely with Parliament and must interact with parliamentarians on a daily basis. It is essential that these officers can work with members in both official languages and must therefore be proficient in both official languages at the time of their employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363852">Why must officers be bilingual at the time of their employment? First, we have the Constitution, which stipulates that French and English are the official languages of Canada. Second, French and English have equal status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of Parliament. Third, parliamentarians have the right to use either French or English during debates and work in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363853">I want to take a moment to express the joy and pride that I have being a member of the NDP caucus, with so many of our members being fluently bilingual and those who are unilingual are making tremendous efforts to learn Canada's other official language so they are better able to do their jobs and interact with their colleagues and other people in Parliament. I am incredibly proud of the number of MPs who are working on that day in and day out. Almost every day when I pass by the lobby, I can see two or three of our members working on that other official language to gain the skills to be better parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363854">Again, this bill only became necessary following the appointment of a unilingual auditor general. Shortly after the announcement, the NDP filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Official Languages for Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363855">In June 2012, the commissioner in his final report about his investigation concluded that the position of auditor general should have been filled by a candidate who was proficient in both official languages. For the commissioner under the Official Languages Act, the Office of the Auditor General, as well as the Auditor General himself, is required to provide services in both official languages as a public figure of a government institution which responds to Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363856">He also concluded that the Privy Council Office, which manages Governor in Council appointments, failed to comply with its obligations under the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363857"> According to the commissioner, “Historically, the appointment process for officers of Parliament was administered by the Senior Appointments Secretariat at the Privy Council Office. The process does not contain precise language proficiency provisions for incumbents of these positions. It is when the position becomes vacant and a recruitment strategy put in place with specific selection criteria that linguistic requirements are determined”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363858">In the case of the Auditor General, the requirements did state that the auditor general should be proficient in both of Canada's official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363859">Respect for Canada's two official languages has always been a priority for the NDP. Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> is consistent with this priority. We want all MPs to give their support to Bill C-419 so it soon becomes law. Proficiency in both official languages at the time of appointment must be recognized as essential, particularly for the 10 offices targeted in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363860">With the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document>, we are taking the first step in ensuring that all future officers of Parliament are bilingual and then we can move on to other aspects, like ensuring that Supreme Court of Canada justices are bilingual so they can hear court cases in both official languages without the need of interpretation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363861">I believe everyone who ever aspires to those high positions and roles should take it upon themselves to learn the other of Canada's official languages, if not already bilingual, so they can apply for these positions and take on the roles that we have in the institutions of Parliament, the Supreme Court and elsewhere to ensure that Canada's linguistic duality is not only respected, but enriched through those additional appointments of bilingual officers of Parliament.</ParaText>

I want to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170255" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>, whose riding is next to mine, on her wonderful, excellent work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363863">My colleague introduced Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> after a unilingual anglophone was appointed Auditor General in November 2011. At first the Conservative government defended the appointment of the Auditor General and opposed the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363864">Fortunately, the government has since changed its mind and seems to now support the NDP's bill. If it passes, Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> will ensure that future appointees to the 10 officer of Parliament positions set out in the bill will be required to understand French and English without the assistance of an interpreter and will have to be able to express themselves clearly in both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363865">In short, Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> sets out the 10 positions for which bilingualism is considered an essential qualification. Because of the nature of the work, these positions require the individual to communicate with all parliamentarians and Canadians in the official language of their choice. It is a matter of respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363866">I am happy to see that the bill has made it through the important step of being studied by the Standing Committee on Official Languages. The essence of the bill remained intact, which is excellent news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363867">However, I have to wonder why the Conservatives did not explain some of the amendments they proposed to the structure of the bill. The Conservatives removed the preamble, which emphasized the importance of the equal status of French and English in parliamentary institutions and in the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363868">When he was called upon to speak to the bill, the Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, spoke in favour of including such a preamble in the bill. He said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363869">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I have heard no arguments for deleting this preamble. It is practical, and I consider it useful. It expresses the spirit of the bill, its goals and objectives, so that ordinary people can understand why the bill has been introduced. It also describes the bill's overall aims.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363870">It is unfortunate, but it has become apparent that, when the Conservatives amend legislation, far too often they remove the context and historical references. It is truly disgraceful. That kind of attitude must be denounced and corrected. I suggest that the Conservatives change their approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363871">I sometimes get the impression that the Conservative government is confused about its definition of bilingualism. You have to admit that it is hard to reconcile how, on the one hand, the Conservatives claim to be advocates for official languages and yet, on the other hand, they impose budgetary restrictions at the expense of bilingualism. The fact is that if you peel away the rhetoric, French is far too often given second-class status. There are so many examples attesting to this that it is impossible not to doubt the sincerity of the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363872">Here are the plain facts. The government appointed a unilingual anglophone to the position of Auditor General. The Conservative government also appoints unilingual anglophone judges to the Supreme Court of Canada. It is the Conservative government that coerces francophone public servants to work more often in English. It was under a Conservative government that the pilots who travel on the Saint Lawrence River between Quebec City and Montreal had to file a complaint last winter with the Commissioner of Official Languages because they were unable to communicate in French with the crews of two Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers. Finally, it is also this Conservative government that does not see the problem with closing the only bilingual rescue centre in Canada, perhaps even in North America.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363873">There is no doubt that the state of bilingualism in Canada is cause for great concern. Last year, the Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, expressed his fear that the $5.2 billion in spending cuts called for by Ottawa between now and 2015 would result in a number of unwelcome surprises, such as a reduction in the services provided in both official languages. Unfortunately, the commissioner’s predictions seem to be coming true. The members on the other side of the House do not know where the money is going. Furthermore, in the blink of an eye, $3 billion that was supposed to go towards fighting terrorism has gone missing. Had the government invested in bilingualism, perhaps we would not be where we are today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3363874">According to an article in the daily newspaper <I>Le Devoir</I>, budget cuts are forcing departments to reduce the number of documents they have translated. This is evidenced by the fact that the production rate at the Translation Bureau dropped by 9% in 2011–12, with a further drop of 17% forecast for 2012–13. Moreover, departments are asking francophone staff to write their reports in English in order to save time and money.<I/></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363875">In my opinion, the situation is, quite simply, unacceptable. Ottawa is even streamlining the office of Commissioner Fraser. In future, it will have to use money from its own budget to update its computer systems in order to process complaints more efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363876">If the government really cares about bilingualism, as we do on this side of the House, logically, it should be providing the commissioner with more resources so that he can do his job properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363877">Recently, I read in a newspaper that bilingualism has stagnated over the past decade. This is really appalling. We want more and more people across Canada, geographically the second-largest country in the world, to be proud of their Canadian history, which endowed us with two official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363878">These two languages allow us to bring together people from all continents. We should be more proud of that. That is why it is important to invest in this area and to tap into Canadian pride regarding our two wonderful official languages, French and English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363879">In 2002, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that Canada is not a bilingual country. Ironically, today he is saying that it is his duty to protect the French language throughout this country. How times have changed. Again this week, however, according to an article in <I>Le Droit</I>, the Commissioner of Official Languages said that he needed to weigh his options for forcing the government to abide by the Official Languages Act when appointing judges, ambassadors, deputy ministers and heads of crown corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363880">Last year, Graham Fraser asked that the Privy Council Office, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, take into consideration the Official Languages Act when determining the language requirements for thousands of positions filled by Governor in Council appointments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363881">In the commissioner's opinion, if a position requires a bilingual candidate, the government should ensure that the selection committee respects that criterion. One year later, the government has remained silent on that recommendation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3363889">Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170255" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> on her bill concerning bilingualism as a hiring requirement for officers of Parliament. This gap is totally unacceptable and has lasted for far too long. Needless to say, the subject of this bill, namely Canada's linguistic duality, is a key issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363890"> Respect for Canada's two official languages is a priority for the NDP. This bill is very timely, since this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Laurendeau-Dunton commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363891">A Statistics Canada study released on Tuesday tracking bilingualism from 1961 to 2011 shows that young people are less and less exposed to French, and few immigrants are bilingual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363892">The Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, has also expressed concern about the statistics shown by this study. This trend is not a good omen. The study tracked the evolution of bilingualism in Canada since the Laurendeau-Dunton commission was created. That is what laid the foundations for Canada's policy on bilingualism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363893">When it comes to public life and bilingualism in Canada, certain concrete measures have far-reaching effects. This is why my colleague introduced this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363894"> This is about defending bilingualism in Canada, so we need to take meaningful action to do that. Obviously, we all know that this bill stems from the controversy generated by the appointment of a unilingual Auditor General in November 2011, when the job posting for the vacancy clearly said that proficiency in both official languages was an essential qualification for the position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363895"> In spite of the government’s change of direction on this bill, the fact remains that its track record in this regard is not a glowing one, and its negligence is detrimental to Canada's linguistic duality. The most blatant example of this was the appointment of Michael Ferguson as Auditor General. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363896"> That is why the NDP decided to take action by introducing a bill to recognize that officers of Parliament must be fluent in both official languages at the time they take up their positions. I am therefore glad that the government has ultimately listened to reason on this issue, at least with respect to officers of Parliament. That is a start. The Conservative government has a chance to stop taking us backward on official languages. This is a simple matter of respecting the language rights of Canadians and the parliamentarians who represent them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363897"> Proficiency in both official languages at the time of appointment must be recognized as an essential qualification for the 10 key positions identified in the bill. The policy on official bilingualism must apply to officers of Parliament. If it does not, Canada's linguistic duality will be seriously undermined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363898"> Let us now look at this bill, and how important it is, in greater detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363899"> By the nature of their duties, officers of Parliament have to be able to communicate with parliamentarians and Canadians in the official language of their choice. We know very well that this was not the case for the appointment of the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363900"> Accordingly, if the bill is enacted, future occupants of the 10 positions in question will have to understand French and English without the assistance of an interpreter and will have to be able to express themselves clearly in both official languages when they take up their position. It therefore recognizes that proficiency in both official languages is essential to the performance of their duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363901"> The following positions will be affected by these measures: Auditor General of Canada, Chief Electoral Officer, Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada, Privacy Commissioner and Information Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363902"> Under this bill, the appointment of a unilingual person to the position of Auditor General or to any other of the 10 key positions would simply have been impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363903"> This bill has brilliantly managed to clarify the linguistic obligations of officers of Parliament so that this kind of situation will never occur again. Only 10 positions are affected by the bill, which thus acknowledges that proficiency in both official languages is essential in performing the duties of officers of Parliament. Consequently, officers must have that proficiency at the time they take up their duties, for a number of reasons.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3363904"> The Constitution provides that English and French are the official languages of Canada. English and French enjoy equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in the institutions of Parliament. Parliamentarians have a right to use English or French in the debates and proceedings of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363905"> Since officers of Parliament maintain close ties with Parliament and must interact with parliamentarians, it is essential that the incumbents of those positions be proficient in both official languages at the time they are hired. This is also quite obviously a simple matter of respect for our official languages, which, under the Constitution, have the same status in Canada, and for both linguistic groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363906"> Everything thus stems from the NDP's actions in this matter because the NDP filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada following the appointment of a unilingual individual to the position of Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363907"> In June 2012, the commissioner concluded in his final investigation report that the position of Auditor General should have been filled by a candidate with proficiency in Canada's two official languages. In the commissioner's view, the Office of the Auditor General is required under the Official Languages Act to offer services in both official languages, and the same is true of the Auditor General himself as the public face of a federal institution that reports to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363908"> He also concluded that the Privy Council Office, which manages Governor in Council appointments, had failed to meet its obligations under the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363909"> According to the commissioner, historically, the appointment process for officers of Parliament was administered by the Senior Appointments Secretariat at the Privy Council Office. The process does not contain precise language for fluency provisions for incumbents of these positions. It is when the position becomes vacant and a recruitment strategy is put in place with specific selection criteria that linguistic requirements are determined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363910"> Thus Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> also offers a solution to the absence of specific provisions regarding the language skills of officers of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363911"> This bill is particularly important for the francophones of all countries, including Quebeckers. Quebec's National Assembly unanimously condemned this appointment and the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne strongly denounced it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363912"> The response of the Commissioner of Official Languages and francophones across the country is clear, as is the NDP's approach. We will no longer tolerate unilingual appointments to such important positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363913"> In conclusion, and because we are dealing with important positions, I would also like to tell the Conservative government again how important it is that judges on the Supreme Court be bilingual, and this should be the second logical step to be taken by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363914"> The debate is not over. We still have not swallowed the appointment of the unilingual Justice Moldaver to the Supreme Court. With the government's continued refusal to include bilingualism as a selection criterion for the appointment of judges, English is becoming the main language of an institution that is central to Canadian public life. Therefore, there is still much work to be done in terms of bilingualism in Canada, and it is high time that this changed. The time for defending the principle of unilingual central institutions, such as the Supreme Court, has come and gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363915"> I said earlier and I repeat that my colleague’s bill will remedy this deplorable situation regarding officers of Parliament. Proficiency in both official languages is essential for some positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363916"> As we know, the NDP is firmly committed to protecting the language rights of Canadians, and we hope that all parliamentarians will support Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> so that it becomes law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363917"> I am sure members will agree with me when I say that this bill is very important for francophones in all countries, and especially the constituents of Montcalm, who for the most part are French-speaking. Many of them have Acadian roots. Therefore, for the four municipalities of New Acadia and for the NDP members from Quebec, respect for both official languages is a priority, but for the people in my riding of Montcalm, being served in French is not a choice, it is simply a very legitimate right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363920">This is the ultimate chance for me to express my deepest gratitude to everyone. I am thankful to all members for believing in this bill. We are going through a rough week in Parliament, and I believe it is a welcomed change to see that everybody is of one mind on at least one topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363921">I have enjoyed listening to what was said in the House during the debate. I am impressed by the attachment felt and expressed by my colleagues toward Canadian bilingualism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363922">If we look back just a short 50 years, we can clearly see all of the progress that has been accomplished in matters of minority linguistic rights in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363923">Linguistic diversity is a wonderful thing. In this particular case, Canadian society is very fortunate. We have made a choice to become a state where two languages will be equal in rights. For all those small French-speaking communities across the prairies, for the Franco-Ontarians, for the dynamic and creative Anglo-Quebeckers and for the wonderful Acadian nation, this decision embodies one very clear need, that being survival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363924">The days when we thought the only way for us to live together was to trample each other are not far removed from us. Terrible things were said, insults were exchanged and injustice often had the upper hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363925">Looking back, we can see that somehow, by believing in this crazy ideal, we have changed and succeeded. This House of our common understanding represents this leap forward that we have accomplished. The Parliament of Canada, true to the ideals of state bilingualism, functions in both official languages and, if I may add, functions very well, in English and in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363926">Once again, I would like to salute the hard work of the talented translators and interpreters who contribute every day to making this institution all that it hopes itself to be. What we have here is a case of genuine excellence, and I believe all Canadians should be proud of this. Our most grateful thanks to all them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363927">However, translators and interpreters cannot do everything. They cannot be everywhere all the time. As well, certain positions necessary to the proper functioning of Parliament require a skill that elected officials do not need. Officers of Parliament are an integral part of the system. In fact, they are the safeguards embedded in the system that make sure everything is lawful, proper and in order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363928">As such, the individuals who hold these positions are as important as the security staff on the Hill. The friendly security guards protect the physical integrity of this Parliament whereas the officers of Parliament protect its moral integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363929">It goes without saying that both groups need to be bilingual. Both groups need to be available for elected officials and Canadians at large, in English or in French.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3363930"> Fortunately, it appears that we are all in agreement and saying that the list of 10 positions proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5526983" Type="4">C-419</Document> includes people who must be bilingual in order to do their job. I think that this list, which is the cornerstone of my bill, kept as it is, even with the amendments put forward in committee, helps strengthen the foundations of our Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363931"> We are contributing to the effectiveness of Parliament and we are adding a greater sense of respect for this institution that, after all, represents all Canadians. Thanks to our goodwill, we are making tangible improvements. Furthermore, we are sending a clear message to the people of Canada. We are reiterating to them that bilingualism is a guarantee of excellence in the federal administration and that, in addition to opening doors, bilingualism first and foremost opens hearts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363932"> I imagine that we will always have our little squabbles. Language is, after all, the highest and most impregnable bulwark of identity. As soon as there is the tiniest question about the place of honour that language holds in our pride in our identity, anyone and everyone gets up in arms. We start saying “we” instead of “I” and we ascribe cohesive intentions and ideals to millions of people who do not even know each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363933">Let us keep in mind that we have sometimes courted disaster by trying to be too proud and too strong. I believe that my generation has understood that a fluid identity is a good thing and a clear, firm step towards the other. This is a multi-faceted world, and the people of my generation are too busy experiencing this diversity to martyr themselves to the cause of national retrenchment. My generation is no longer afraid it will disappear—it is only afraid of not being able to reach its full potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363934">I encourage young Canadians growing up in linguistic minority communities to believe in their own language and the benefits it offers. I would remind young people who are part of the linguistic majority, Quebeckers and English Canadians, that the world will open up to them if only they open up to it. I beg them not to turn inward because they are unwilling to learn. If they open their hearts to other languages, they will never regret it. </ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Mr. Larry Miller (Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3363947">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, the Fair Rail Freight Service Act</Document>. I will focus my remarks on how this bill will contribute to strengthening the shipper-railway relationship as it facilitates the commercial negotiation of service agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363948">Canada's freight rail network is a vital link to global markets and supply chains, because it facilitates the import and export of millions of dollars worth of commodities and manufactured goods each and every day. Our economy relies on the billions of dollars of revenue generated by Canadian manufactured goods and export commodities, such as grain, pulp and paper, coal and potash. Canadian consumers and businesses also depend on containerized goods, arriving daily from Asia and Europe, moving to cities across the country in an efficient manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363949">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> will help the thousands of companies that rely on rail to ship these goods and will help the Canadians who are employed by these sectors. Given the importance of rail to Canada's economy and trade, ultimately Bill C-52 will contribute to Canada's economic growth and job creation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363950">The goal of Bill C-52 is to support the adoption of service agreements between shippers and railways. Service agreements can help strengthen the shipper-railway relationship. They can make it easier for businesses to plan how they will transport their goods to market. In recent years, the railways and their supply chain partners, including shippers, ports and terminals, have signed many such agreements. These agreements have improved rail service, collaboration, communication, and ultimately, supply chain efficiency. In short, service agreements are a tool to bring greater certainty and reliability to rail freight service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363951">This bill supports best practice in the industry. To achieve this, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> has two parts. It would provide shippers with the right to a service agreement, and it would offer service arbitration to establish the terms and conditions of service in the event that negotiations fail. Most importantly, the new provision would create a strong incentive for the parties to negotiate service agreements commercially. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363952">A shipper who wanted a service agreement could approach a railway. In turn, the railway would be obligated to respond to the shipper within 30 days. This would ensure that shippers and railways would first try to reach commercial solutions to tailor their service relationships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363953">In the event negotiations failed, the shipper would then turn to service arbitration to receive an imposed service agreement. However, before arbitration could begin, the shipper would be required to provide advance notice of 15 days to the railway. This 15-day period would further support commercial negotiation, as it would allow both parties one last chance to reach a compromise before service arbitration started. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363954">In the end, it is expected that the current use of service agreements would be expanded. Going forward, any shipper who needed a service agreement would be able to obtain one either commercially or through service arbitration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363955">Some may try to say that this proposed legislation would be adding red tape and would burden rail companies. To this I would like to respond, no. We are providing a solution in case of service failure. We expect railways and shippers to continue working together and building on the success of the proactive measures from the rail freight service review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363956">This proposed legislation is important, because it provides the framework to enhance the standard level of respect for service agreements. This has many benefits. By facilitating better collaboration between shippers and railways through negotiating service agreements, parties could then agree on clear service elements and performance standards. Shippers and railways would clearly know what was expected of each other and would be able to work better together to make their day-to-day interactions more efficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363957">Service agreements could also strengthen the relationship between shippers and railways by determining what to do when there is a service failure. Communication protocols could be put in place and recovery plans could lay out how and when service could resume. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3363958">Canadian shippers and railways could also use service agreements to lay the foundation for how they could expand their businesses together. Negotiations on a service agreement could be an opportunity for a shipper to discuss traffic growth plans and see how railway service could be adapted to respond to growth. The legislative right to a service agreement, supported by an arbitration process if commercial negotiations fail, would therefore be quite powerful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363959">Across Canada, shippers, whether large or small, whether shipping intermodal containers or raw commodities, would be entitled to obtain service agreements establishing a road map with the railway to achieve the benefits I just explained. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363960">However, do not take only my word for it. This is what Mr. Rick White, General Manager of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, had to say about Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363962">That brings me to Canadian trade and our gateway and corridor initiatives. The railways played a primordial role in Canada's settlement and economic expansion, and they continue to play a key role. Rail networks are a core part of Canada's transportation system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363963">Our Conservative government has worked to strengthen Canada's transportation system in various ways, including with strategic gateways and trade corridor initiatives. Through these initiatives, our Conservative government, along with its partners, has made significant investments to reduce congestion along key corridors and to build capacity to capitalize on growing trade opportunities. Our gateway initiatives also encourage stakeholder engagement and dialogue as a key means of improving how our gateways function. Evidence shows that this gets results. Through working together, stakeholders have been able to address operational issues and enhance the performance of our gateways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363964">The proposed new legislative measure on service agreements supports such partnerships. It is through such partnerships that we can achieve an efficient and reliable supply chain. This would allow us to meet demand in existing, expanding and new trade markets. In this sense, the legislation would support our government's economic agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363965">In my role as chair of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, I had the opportunity, as the other members did, to hear first-hand from shippers and other stakeholders about the importance of this legislation. I was pleased to hear that there was an astounding amount of support for this bill, and the committee heard this testimony from the groups involved. Whether it was Port Metro Vancouver from British Columbia; the Manitoba Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation, Steve Ashton; or the Halifax Port Authority, Canadians from coast to coast to coast were supportive of this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363966">That does not take away the fact that in agreements like this, not everyone gets everything he or she wants, but I think everyone would have to admit that we came out with a balanced bill. That is why I am here speaking in support of it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3363975">As I said, agriculture is one of the main pillars of my riding and certainly one of the main pillars of the Canadian economy. Canada's agriculture, and indeed the entire agri-food industry, plays a vital role in creating jobs and keeping our economy strong. However, our farmers depend on efficient, effective and reliable rail service so that they are able to move crops off the farm to valued customers, not just in Canada but around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363976">That is exactly what Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> will do for our hardworking farmers. It will ensure their right to a service agreement with railways to enhance clarity, predictability and reliability when shipping their product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363977">Furthermore, I would like to expand on the nature of the bill and indicate that the bill is not only a benefit to the shipper but that the rail services will also benefit from the changes that will be brought forth in the bill. The bill does not pit shipper against rail service. The goal of this legislation is rather to encourage railways and shippers to work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363978">The fair rail freight service act would help shippers to manage and expand their businesses while ensuring the railways can operate an efficient network for the benefit of all users. This will ensure a strong, competitive rail freight supply chain, which is critical to the success of the Canadian economy. In these challenging global economic times, all sectors of the economy must work together to drive growth, create jobs and ensure long-term prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363979">Before I wrap up my comments, I would like to proactively answer some the questions that opposition members of the House may have with regard to the bill. I will begin with the possible question that may arise about why the bill had not been tabled earlier. The response to this is quite simple: it takes time to get things right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363980">On this piece of legislation, we took the time necessary to hold in-depth consultations with stakeholders on the matter. We carefully reviewed the submissions that we received so that we could advance with a framework that would benefit all parties involved. It was a long process, but as members can see by some of the quotes I presented earlier, it has worked, and we have a very useful bill before us in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363981">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. I see members of that committee from all sides of the House here. We did not always agree on everything, but at the end of the day we have a good bill, and I would be remiss if I did not mention the strong work and support by the <Affiliation DbId="191921" Type="96">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation>. This is a bill that many people, including shippers, have asked for, for a number of years. The minister has done it, and we are here today discussing it in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363982">Another question that is brought up around the bill is the notion that new provisions in the bill will negatively affect the efficiency of Canada's rail system. This is not true. The arbitrator must consider the efficiency of the rail network and railways' obligation to provide service to all shippers when making decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363983">Finally, I will respond to the possible question of why there is not a list of elements that must be included in a service agreement under the bill. This is because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to these agreements. Every situation between shippers and rail services will be different and will require different needs. Therefore, this approach will ensure that the arbitrator has the flexibility needed to make the appropriate decisions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3363984">I think there will be few of these arbitration decisions, but there would be that flexibility for the two parties to sit down, and the arbitration process would occur only when a custom-made deal that works for both parties cannot be worked out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363985">To conclude, service agreements are an important commercial tool that supports the shipper-railway relationship because they bring clarity and predictability to rail service. As some associations put it after the tabling of the bill in December 2012, this will serve as a platform for continued collaboration with Canadian railways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363986">This bill would work wonders for shippers and rail services in Canada and would be of enormous benefit to all sectors, including the agriculture industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363987">The government's objective is to facilitate the adoption of service agreements between shippers and railways for those shippers who want one, and Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would accomplish this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363988">I urge members to join me in supporting this bill. I hope that my colleagues across the way will show their support for this bill and vote in favour of its passage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363989">We have heard from many members during the discussion on this bill, and while I mentioned agriculture quite a bit, because there are a lot of agriculture products that travel, the bill would affect everything from forestry to fertilizer to potash. Therefore, this bill is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3363990">Saskatchewan is the largest producer of potash in the world, a lot of which is exported, and rail allows it to get moved. As well, the mining industry transports all kinds of products. There is even talk right now of more crude oil moving by rail. I think we all have to admit that pipelines would be the preferred route, but business will always look at every opportunity out there, and rail is one of them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364003">Mr. Speaker, my colleague on the other side just asked about the introduction of this piece of legislation. It actually started in 2008, with the rail freight service review. It was a two-year process. It was quite extensive and exhaustive, and there was enough guilt on the railway side as well as on the shippers' side when it comes to numbers to make it clear that something had to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364004"> This measure was first introduced—in fact, I introduced it—in March in 2012, prior to the election, and then was picked up after the election, in December. This is a piece of legislation that has come a long way and has had lots of consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364005">My question for my hon. colleague is this. When the railway companies looked at this legislation initially, they fought against it, said they did not need it and said they would arrive at their service arrangements themselves. They said that it would drive negotiation away from the table. What I believe will happen is that it will drive both parties to the table, and if they cannot negotiate, it would be an arbitrated settlement. I wonder if my colleague would agree with me.</ParaText>

However, at the end of the day, my colleague is absolutely correct that this bill would encourage even more agreements between shippers and railways. As everybody knows from listening to the debate today and tonight, some agreements have already been voluntarily signed between them, but this measure would create more and bring them all to the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364008">Nobody likes change, and that probably includes shippers and railways, but I think this bill will do what it is intended to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364017">Mr. Speaker, to begin, I would like to tell you that I will be sharing my time with the very able member for <Affiliation DbId="170756" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364018">I am pleased to rise in the House today to discuss the bill that would give customers of railway companies the right to establish service agreements with those companies and would create an arbitration process in case of failed negotiations. Despite its weaknesses, the bill is very important for the Canadian economy, especially for the agricultural, mining and forestry sectors, which depend heavily on rail transport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364019">The bill is not perfect. Still, we appreciate that after so many years of fine words and no action, the Conservatives have finally acted and introduced the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364020">On this subject, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> who, by introducing her own bill on protecting customers of railway companies, was able to prod the Conservative government into action. The government presented its bill six months later. Better late than never.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364021"> My speech will have three parts. First, I will highlight the importance of strengthening the position of shippers in Canada's rail transport sector. Then I will show that the bill does not go far enough to improve services and protect shippers. Finally, I will propose amendments based on the recommendations presented to the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities by the Coalition of Rail Shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364022"> Why is it important to take action to improve rail transportation services? Because rail is among the most-used means of transport in Canada. In Canada, railways transport more than 70% of goods shipped on land. The economic power of railways is considerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364023"> That leads me to my second point. Despite the importance of this mode of transportation for many shippers, service interruptions, delays and various problems with productivity are common among rail transporters. This situation affects many sectors, including natural resources, agriculture, forest products, mines, chemical industries and the automotive sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364024"> In terms of agriculture, 80% of service agreements are not complied with by the railway companies. This means delays or trains that simply do not arrive, damaged rail cars or not enough rail cars. In addition to the losses caused by this kind of problem—such as harvests that may rot—the poor quality of rail transport services undermines the ability of Canadian exporters to compete in world markets. This situation costs the Canadian economy many hundreds of millions of dollars every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364025">Let us now try to determine the source of these problems. One of sources of these problems is, of course, the virtual monopoly. As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170448" Type="2">Okanagan—Coquihalla</Affiliation> said earlier in his question, the problem is the monopoly held by the railways in Canada. In most regions of the country, shippers cannot choose their railway carrier because they have access either to CN or to CP. Even in cases where both companies are present, one of the two usually charges prices that are much too high, which does not leave shippers with much of a choice. To some extent, the monopoly situation was made possible by the Liberals when they were in power. They are the ones who privatized CN in 1995. By failing to set out protective measures for shippers, they reinforced the virtual monopoly we have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364026">At the time, one option would have been to privatize railway activities while ensuring that the rail transportation system remained public, which also would have been beneficial for VIA Rail. Right now, VIA Rail mostly has to use rented tracks belonging to CN.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364027">When I was deputy critic of transport, I met with the Western Canadian Shippers' Coalition and it let me know what it needed to help foster economic growth in the west, on the Prairies. I am sure it is going to be happy to see this very bill come to life. It has been waiting for more than five years. It has been waiting for seven years for this legislation to come to life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364028">Just to clarify for Canadians, the Western Canadian Shippers' Coalition is made up of important Canadian companies, like the Alberta Newsprint Company, Al-Pac Forest Industries Inc., Canadian Forest Products Inc., Canadian Oilseed Processors Association, Canadian Wheat Board, Coal Valley Resources Inc., Coalspur Mines Ltd., Dunkley Lumber Ltd., Grand Cache Coal Corporation, Lehigh Cement, Chemtrade, Millar Western Forest Products and Suncor, among many other important Canadian companies. Many of these companies are in the natural resources sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364029">The government tends to think that it is the best friend of the resource sector. The sector relies on the government as a regulator to ensure reliability in terms of service. The result, if it is done properly, is that companies prosper and flourish. Without leadership, without the government taking on its role as regulator, the companies simply endure or, even worse, sometimes flounder. This legislation would allow the companies to simply endure. It is not good enough to let them prosper and flourish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364030">The NDP would prefer to see these companies prosper and contribute to the health of our resources sector and the agricultural sector. In committee, there were amendments proposed by these two sectors. The NDP listened, but the government was in such a rush to fall behind, that it really did not listen to what these companies were asking for. I am going to read what the companies asked for and what the Conservatives did not consider. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364031">One thing they wanted to do was to fix the service agreements. They wanted, one, to include details on service agreement components; two, a deletion of the term “operational” as it would limit the ability to negotiate and arbitrate service agreements; three, to include a dispute resolution mechanism in service agreements for breach of contract; four, to limit the ability of railway companies to levy penalties and charges that are not in the service agreement; five, to limit arbitration for failed service agreement negotiations to matters raised by the shipper; six, to limit railway companies' ability to raise network issues in arbitration, for example, finding convenient excuses for not agreeing to shippers' demands in contract negotiations and arbitrations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364032">New Democrats felt that these were very reasoned amendments and the government had a choice: it could listen to the resource sector and Canadian farmers or it could listen to a monopoly with a long history of manipulating government throughout Canadian history. Unfortunately, it looks like it chose, for these amendments at least, the side of the monopoly, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170448" Type="2">Okanagan—Coquihalla</Affiliation> mentioned.</ParaText>

We do not abandon those principles for the sake of power. We do not remain silent in the face of adversity. </ParaText>

The government should have listened to the good people who work on the farm or the people who work in the resource sector. Instead, time after time, Conservatives choose to listen to the privileged few to enable their abuse of power and give them carte blanche to crush Canadian competitiveness. Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>

This topic has been a very important one for my constituents and for people across rural communities and, particularly, western Canada.</ParaText>

She has worked very hard on reforming this act, in particular, and bringing the NDP position forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364056">The NDP position is fundamentally one of seeking fairness and a fair playing field for those who depend on rail service as part of their work, business and industry and, very important, the communities that depend on fair rail service to ensure their employers and industries are dealt with appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364057">We in the NDP have made it clear that we support the bill at this point, but we believe it must be strengthened as we go forward. We are not pleased with the delays that the government has allowed and also the kind of cowering we have seen from it, which is not a surprise, to major corporate interests in this field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364058">As we know, the proposed bill will give rail freight customers or shippers the right to service agreements with rail companies. It also puts in place a Canadian Transportation Agency-led arbitration process for failed negotiations and penalties for those who violate the arbitration results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364059">Key amendments that the shipping company pushed for and that were championed by the NDP were unfortunately defeated in the committee. Without these rejected amendments, we believe the bill remains a partial success for the shippers and it must be strengthened in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364060">It is important that we indicate to stakeholders and to the government that this is not a done deal. As with anything, but particularly when we talk about this area, the bill needs to be further strengthened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364061">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> partially addresses the fact that rail freight customers, known as shippers, have been suffering from insufficient freight services stemming from the abuse of market power by the large rail companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364062">The Conservative government has finally tabled legislation, after years of talking and inaction, to address the fact that many shippers cannot even get a service agreement as rail companies have not been willing to negotiate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364063">As the bill only covers new service agreements, current agreements and contract violation, which are all a major source of revenue loss for shippers, are not affected by Bill C-52.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364065">I recognize that the wish for this act to be strengthened comes in large part from people who work in the mining industry. As someone representing an area that depends on mining and as someone who is proud to say that I come from and live in a mining town, I recognize that in order to ship the ore and the goods that are needed for the mining industry to both do its job and to export its product, fair rail services are essential.</ParaText>

Whether this network is owned by a government, as it used to be, or it is a private enterprise, the member wants the shipper to be able to go to the rail company and say, “I want you to ship my goods and I do not care what else you have in your network; it has to be completely ignored.

              <ParaText id="3364100">Mr. Speaker, it does not surprise me. The NDP members feel the Liberals nipping at their heels, so they are a little excited and a little nervous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364101">We are here to talk about Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, so let me begin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364102"><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364103"><B>Mr. Mark Adler:</B> I am happy to receive such praise from the opposition, and I look forward to their support of Bill C-52.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364104">I would first like to thank the <Affiliation DbId="191921" Type="96">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> for his steadfast and laser-like focus on creating the bill that is before us today to bring fairness to this sector of our economy. Of course, I also want to thank my colleagues on the transport, infrastructure and communities committee, particularly our chairman who has done yeoman's work in making sure the bill got through the committee expeditiously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364105">As the minister said on December 11, 2012, “This bill will help shippers maintain and grow their businesses while ensuring that railways can manage an efficient shipping network for everyone”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364106">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> supports the interests of the entire economy. Given the importance of rail service to our country, shippers need to have service clearly defined and they need to know that the railways will deliver rail service efficiently and effectively. That is the only way shippers can properly plan and seize market opportunities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364107">I would like to talk about some of the new provisions that are proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. First, the bill would give every shipper the right to a service agreement with the railway and would provide an efficient and effective process for establishing such an agreement when commercial negotiations fail. That is key. Every shipper would be able to request a service agreement with their railway. That is an important point. The railway would now have 30 days to respond. This particular change is an important gain for all shippers, including small and medium-size businesses. It would ensure that they have an opportunity to negotiate service with the railway directly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364108">Second, if the parties cannot agree commercially, the shipper would have access to a timely and efficient process to establish an agreement. Under the auspices of the Canadian Transportation Agency, shippers would be able to request an arbitration process. This important arbitration process would establish, in a clear and comprehensive manner, how the rail service would be provided by the railway. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364109">For many years, shippers have raised concerns that they have faced additional costs or lost sales when rail service is inadequate, particularly when they face regular problems such as delays in receiving rail cars. Canadian businesses or farmers can agree that this situation is a significant challenge for their operations. Shippers generally acknowledge that railways have made improvements to freight service in recent years. However, shippers believe that an effective enforcement mechanism is essential to ensuring that improvements continue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364110">This brings me to the third important point. We want to ensure that railways are held accountable in the event of service failures. This would be achieved through monetary penalties. These financial penalties could reach up to $100,000 for every confirmed breach of an arbitrated service agreement. Specifically, the financial penalty would take the form of an administrative monetary penalty under the auspices of the Canadian Transportation Agency. This consequence would ensure greater railway accountability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="20">(2020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364111">Now, let me explain how this new provision would work. When a shipper is concerned that a railway has breached a service agreement that the agency had arbitrated, he or she could ask the agency to examine the situation. If the agency confirms a service failure in such a case, it can apply the monetary penalty to the railway company for a confirmed breach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364112">This potential and significant financial penalty would provide a strong incentive to comply with arbitrated service agreements. The amount of the penalty imposed would depend on the severity of the service breach. As with any administrative monetary penalty system managed by a regulatory body, the penalty would be payable to the Crown and not to the shipper. The agency is the appropriate body to confirm whether a breach has occurred, and can set a penalty accordingly. Indeed, the agency's role under this new provision would be to look at the reason for the breach and determine the right consequences, case by case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364113">Giving the agency the authority to impose the administrative monetary penalties is a sound approach. During consultations for this bill, both shippers and railways acknowledged the agency's expertise in rail freight service issues. In addition to this strong new enforcement tool, shippers will also have access to two other mechanisms to address railway service problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364114">Of course all shippers will retain their right to file a complaint on service with the agency. All shippers will also retain the right to seek damages resulting from railway service failures through the courts. These rights apply regardless of whether shippers have agreements arbitrated by the agency or agreements they negotiated commercially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364115">First, a shipper can file a complaint with the agency under the existing level service provision under the act, which requires railways to provide adequate and suitable service. If the agency confirms that the railway has not met its service obligations, it has broad powers to order a range of corrective actions to be taken by the railway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364116">The new provision on service agreements complements this existing remedy for examining rail service complaints. If a shipper has a service agreement that defines clearly the railway's service obligations, this will provide a more precise reading of when obligations are not met, and facilitate the filing of a complaint in such a case if a shipper deems it necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364117">Second, shippers will continue to be able to sue for damages incurred due to rail service failures. Seeking damages through litigation is an especially important option for those shippers who are seeking compensation for significant lost sales or costs incurred due to a railway service failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364118">Shippers wanted to ensure that any new enforcement tool, such as administrative monetary penalties, does not undermine any existing remedies. This strong new enforcement mechanism would not in any way disrupt, replace or erode existing shipper remedies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364119">I am confident that in most cases shippers and railways would be able to work out service agreements commercially that include communication protocols to be followed when service failures occur. Moreover, I expect commercial agreements would also identify recovery plans to mitigate the impact of any service failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364120">The great strength of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is that all of its elements would help drive commercial negotiations. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364121">Through the implementation of the bill, shippers will be in a better position to negotiate service agreements with the railway in the commercial forum. Both railways and shippers have expressed their preference for commercial solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364122">As all stakeholders continue to work in collaborative partnerships, I firmly believe that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> includes a strong enforcement mechanism. It provides the best way forward in supporting commercial solutions and innovations that strengthen our rail freight system, a system that will foster Canada's economic growth, a system that will support shippers and railways as they strive to grow their businesses, capture new opportunities and create jobs and prosperity for Canada and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364123">I strongly encourage all members of this place to vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, a bill that would not only help strengthen our railway system, it would support our growing economy and lead to jobs, growth and long-term prosperity.</ParaText>

They wanted to prove to the world that they could privatize with the best of them. One of the companies they rushed to privatize was CN. They privatized the company, CN. They privatized the tracks. What they forgot to do was put in any safeguards for Canadians, safeguards for shippers and safeguards for our passenger rail service in terms of access to the railway tracks. They basically turned it over to the private sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364164">CN is doing very well. It made a profit of $2.7 billion. Bravo. It is doing well. It was just announced this week that the CEO made a salary of $48 million. I am sure he worked hard for every single penny of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364165">The trouble is that these ideological decisions create problems. It was the Liberals in 1995 that unleashed this, and frankly, neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives after them, for almost 20 years, have done anything to fix the problems until this bill. It is with insufficient measures that they are trying to address the problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364166"> Let me say up front that this is a bill we will be supporting at report stage and third reading, but it is a weak bill. It is a bill that does not do the job Canadians really need it to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364167">The bill would give rail freight customers or shippers the right to service agreements with rail companies. It is shocking that they have not had this before now, especially with the two majors, CN and CP. It also puts in place an arbitration process, led by the Canadian Transportation Agency, in cases of failed negotiations or where there are penalties for violating the results of arbitration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364168"> This is positive. Canadians deserve fair and reliable freight services. This is obvious and logical.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364169">Shippers pay good money, but they need a stronger position vis-à-vis the two main companies that form a duopoly. Together they have a kind of two-party monopoly. Their power is only partially addressed by Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364170">There were recommendations by the shipping community at the committee stage that were sensible, practical and modest, yet the Conservatives ruled them out of hand with no serious consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364171"> As the official opposition finance critic, I certainly know this. With every budget bill we have massive omnibus budget bills. We have been dealing with another one this week, Bill <Document DbId="6108103" Type="3">C-60</Document>, which again, is an amalgamation of all kinds of changes to different laws, many that have nothing to do with finance and budgets. We have seen that they never accept one amendment to any of their budget implementation legislation. Experts in their fields have testified at the finance committee that the government will have problems if it bullies ahead with certain changes, such as getting rid of the inspector general of CSIS. The expert who helped set up CSIS told us that this would cause problems, but it did not matter. The Conservatives are more expert than the experts, and they went ahead and made the changes anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364172">In this case, they heard expert testimony about why certain changes should be made. However, the Conservatives gave them no serious consideration. They rejected the changes out of hand, which is a bit sad, because this House ought to be about discussion, debate, learning, and ultimately, compromise to get the best laws possible for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364173">The bill needs further improvement. The NDP will continue to work with businesses and shippers across the country to improve this legislation and to tackle the issue of uncompetitive freight rates and gouging of the shippers. What we heard from businesses across the country was that they are getting poor customer service. They have had disruptions in rail service and unacceptable service costs. We heard about produce rotting, because it could not be shipped. We heard about lost contracts, because there was no guarantee that the goods could be shipped reliably, which made Canadian businesses unreliable suppliers. We heard about missed connections with ships for travel and shipping. This is a daily occurrence for industries across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364174">Poor rail services are hurting Canadian exporters, damaging our global competitiveness and costing us jobs, which is a little ironic from a government that talks a lot about jobs. However, when the rubber hits the road, it often misses the train. That is what has been happening with this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364175">There are a number of key amendments we put forward that the shipping community pushed for. They were championed by the NDP and defeated at committee. Without the rejected amendments, this bill remains only a partial success. Nevertheless, it is still worthy of our support. I want to stress that we are dissatisfied with the outcome. It is not what the shippers really wanted to see. Therefore, there is a need for future strengthening of this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364176">Sadly, I see that my time is just about up. There is so much else to say. Thanks for the attention of this House. I look forward to the questions of my hon. colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364180">The hon. member knows full well that there was still tremendous frustration that the bill did not go further. For example, the penalties in the service agreements are very limited, a maximum of $100,000, and they do not compensate the shippers. The penalties go to the federal government. It can be costly to fight this arbitration process. There was concern about how all that would work. The arbitration process only applies in very limited situations and only to future agreements, not to existing ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364181">There are still real problems, but, as the member heard me say from the outset, we will support the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364182">Mr. Speaker, a number of Conservatives have stood in their place and pointed out that X and Y support this legislation. There is no doubt there is a fairly long list of individuals or different stakeholders supporting the legislation. I would highly recommend to those listening or presenting this list that they also recognize the fact that just because they are supporting the legislation does not mean they would not like to see the legislation improved upon. In fact, I suspect if we were canvass a number of the groups that the most recent questioner put on the record, we would find a number of them would like to have seen some of the proposed amendments supported and passed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364183">Is my colleague of the same opinion that many groups support the legislation because they see it as a step forward, but, in the same breath, it is a lost opportunity where we could have done so much more? The minister might have the support of all members in the House, but it does not necessarily mean the Conservatives should pat themselves on the back because they could have done a whole lot more. Would she agree with that synopsis?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364184">Mr. Speaker, after almost 20 years of dealing with the frustrations and tremendous power imbalance, I would call it, between the power of the railways to determine the level of service they will offer and the shippers who are desperate to get their products shipped within Canada, out of the country or perhaps to the U.S., certainly any step forward is better than nothing. I agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364185">However, let me give one example of a shortfall. We have greater transborder trade and exchange with the U.S. than between any other two countries in the world, yet shipments from Canada to the U.S. are not covered by the legislation. It is another area where there is a shortfall. Does that mean this bill does nothing? No, of course not. It is a step forward, but it is a missed opportunity. It is not even half a loaf. It is a couple of slices of bread when perhaps we could have had the whole loaf. That is the point.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364186">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> for her excellent speech and her responses to the people who asked her questions. I am always impressed by what a fine job she does as finance critic. I am convinced that Canada would be much better off if she were Minister of Finance today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364187">I rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act (administration, air and railway transportation and arbitration)</Document>, which comes to us from the office of the <Affiliation DbId="191921" Type="96">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, who is also one of my riding neighbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364188">I want to say that, although the NDP and I are preparing to support this bill, which is a step in the right direction, we found the government's closed-mindedness during the study in committee unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364189"> As opposition members, both Liberal and New Democrat, we put forward amendments that were supported by witnesses and experts in the field, and the Conservatives systematically voted against them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364190"> I also want to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> on the incredible job she does as transport critic. Seriously, I would immediately substitute her for the minister from Roberval, who is the Minister of Transport, and transit in Canada would be much better for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364191"> To get to the heart of the matter, for those not familiar with this bill, I want to say that it partly addresses the problems of railway transportation service customers that do not have access to adequate service as result of the monopoly held by the major railway companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364192"> However, since the bill covers only new service agreements, current agreements and contract breaches, which are major causes of revenue losses for shippers, are not affected by Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. That is one of its deficiencies. We would have liked to remedy that in the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, but that was not done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364193"> I will mainly address three points, given the time I have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364194"> First, Canada's shippers deserve fair, reliable railway transportation service that is worth what they pay. The need to strengthen the shippers' position against the monopoly of CN and CP is only partially addressed in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, as I mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364195">The six recommendations from shippers, in committee, were reasonable, practical and modest. That is why we proposed them, yet the Conservatives rejected them without even considering them. I will elaborate on this later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364196">There are other areas that need improving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364197">I would like to stress that the NDP, especially the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, the NDP transport critic, will continue to work with shippers. Shippers shared their concerns with us, and it is clear that despite the passage of this bill, this file will not be closed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364198">We are going to continue to work alongside shippers to improve Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C–52</Document> and address the problem of excessive prices caused by a lack of competition. This is a problem, for which the Conservatives are to blame, because we know that they are in bed with the lobbyists for the major rail companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364199">Personally, I believe that the bill is biased. The Conservative government has acted shamelessly. It could have taken a closer look at the bill and what shippers wanted instead of systematically siding with the rail lobby.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364200">Shippers are often SMEs. I stand up for SMEs. My riding is located in rural Quebec, in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. The main industries in the region, for those who are not aware, are forestry and aluminum production. The Niobec mine, not to mention agriculture, can also be found in my riding. All of these products can be shipped by rail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364201">This bill and the future of Canada's railways directly affect me. At the end of the day, the more that is done to improve the rail network, the stronger the economy that uses this mode of transportation will be. Rail transportation is far more environmentally friendly than transportation by truck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364202">Concerning my first point, many shippers are not satisfied with the services they receive given the price they pay for those services. They are especially critical of the rail transportation service interruptions and the hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to the Canadian economy year after year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364203"> For Canadian industries, this may mean that harvests rot in the fields, that plants and mines are just marking time and they miss the ships meant to transport their products. It may also mean that inadequate rail freight services hurt Canadian exporters, jeopardize our competitive position internationally and cost jobs in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364204">We cannot afford to suffer losses on the international marketplace just because the railways are unable to organize their services properly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364205"> In addition, the clients of rail freight services, from farmers to mining companies, are penalized by the virtual monopoly in rail services. In most parts of the country, shippers cannot choose which rail carrier to use because they only have access to CN or CP. Such is the case in my riding. Even where both rail companies provide services, one of them usually sets its price too high, leaving the shipper with hardly any choice at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364206"> Shippers routinely defray the cost of service interruptions, delays and a range of performance shortcomings by CN and CP. Pickups and deliveries are made on time or not at all. The number of cars requested is often different from the number of cars provided, and the cars provided are sometimes damaged. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364207"> The situation affects many sectors, such as natural resources, manufacturing, agriculture, forestry products, mines, chemicals and the automotive sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364208"> For the most part, the products of these industries are intended for export. The poor quality of rail transport services undermines the ability of Canadian exporters to compete on the international marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364209"> As an example, soybeans from Argentina have a competitive advantage on, for instance, Japanese and Chinese markets because they are delivered more quickly and more punctually than soybeans from Canada, even though the distance covered by the Canadian products is substantially shorter. This clearly shows that there is a problem with our rail system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364210"> Shippers have told the Conservative government about their dissatisfaction for years now, but the Conservatives have not taken any real measures. Since 2007, their approach has been to talk about it and wait. They started off by promising to ask a panel of experts to study the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364211"> I know that the Conservative government likes to postpone the passage of good bills endlessly. However, at some point, you have to move from consultations to actually taking action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364212"> What we want is clear. Farmers and other businesses have been footing the bill for years for the poor quality of rail freight services and have never really been able to get Ottawa’s attention. I am pleased that they have a listening ear in the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364213"> In order to truly remedy the situation, the NDP advocates strengthening the shippers’ position. We are on the side of businesses and exporters, and we are determined to get them the rail freight services they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364214"> Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> will cover only new service agreements, not existing ones, and that presents a problem. It means that many shippers will continue living with unreliable and unfair services with no access to the resolution process when existing service agreements are violated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364215"> Arbitration is available only to shippers negotiating new agreements. Instead of offering all shippers speedy, reliable assistance through dispute resolution, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> offers a limited arbitration process to a small group of shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364216"> The arbitration process presented could be very expensive for shippers and place an unfair burden of proof on them by asking them to prove that they need the services of the rail transportation company. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364217"> One of the things we are calling for is the inclusion of penalties in service agreements, to compensate shippers for service interruptions, damage and lost productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364218"> In its present version, the bill provides for maximum fines of $100,000 to be paid to the federal government, not the shipper. In order for fines to have a deterrent effect, they should be higher, given that CN made a profit of $2.7 billion in 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364219"> The NDP will stand up for farming, mining and forestry communities, like the ones in my riding, and will fight to put an end to the unacceptable treatment and unreliable rail transportation services provided by the big rail companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364220"> We need a stronger bill to protect the customers. We will work with shippers to get them the fair and reliable rail transportation services they deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364221"> The poor quality of rail transportation services causes Canadian shippers hundreds of millions of dollars in damage every year. Canadian jobs are at stake. We have to act now. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364245">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and put some comments on the record in regard to this bill. I had the opportunity to serve as the chair of the transport committee that listened to most of the presentations, and we certainly listened to the concerns expressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364246"> Before I begin my comments, I would like to give congratulations to the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="170700" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. This has not been an easy file. It has been a file where if they do not get it right, they will not get a lot of second chances. They have spent a lot of time working together. They have listened to stakeholders and they have listened to the people who have vested interests in producing a fair deal at the end of the day. This particular bill we are putting forward would address many of the issues that were proposed and put forward by the stakeholders in the negotiations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364247">I do want to start right off by saying that I support this bill. Particularly in my new role as chair of the agriculture committee, it is one that will benefit the agricultural sector, and also the people I represent in the communities of Brandon and Souris.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364248">The decision to move to a fair rail freight service act was discussed in 2011. It was an act to provide shippers with the right to a service level agreement and a process to establish such agreements when commercial negotiations fail. Many people would ask why this new bill is important. Why it is important to agriculture and to farmers? Like any business, it is one thing to have a great product, which I believe our farmers in Canada have, but it is another to be able to get it to market in a timely and efficient way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364249">Across Canada, producers and processors export 50% to 85% of their production, and they rely on an efficient and effective rail service to get their products to their customers. Farmers today ship 65% of their soybeans, 70% of their wheat and over 83% of their pulses beyond our borders. Last year alone, Canada reached a new record of exporting $47.7 billion in agricultural food and seafood, with significant increases in key markets, such as China, Hong Kong and Russia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364250">We are not done. We are on track to increase those export dollars and expand our markets. A full one-third of those exports are driven by Canada's world-class grain industry, which is also a powerful engine of our jobs and our economy and what our government has been all about for the last several years. It brings $15 billion to the farm gate. Jobs and growth depend on exports. An efficient rail service upholds the reputation of our agricultural exporters in foreign markets, and if our buyers are happy with delivery they will come back for more Canadian products rather than moving on to other sources of supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364251">Our government remains very focused on trade because it drives one in five jobs across our great country. As part of our government's strategy for economic growth and prosperity, we have been pursuing a very ambitious trade agenda. I suggest to the members opposite that regrettably they were not able to participate in approving the trade agendas we have put forward, but they continue to move Canada forward, particularly our agricultural producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364252">In fact, a key part of our economic action plan is the most ambitious trade agenda in Canadian history. Since taking office, we have concluded trade agreements with nine countries and have many more in the hoppers. We recently released the Agriculture and Agri-Food Market Access Report, documenting some of the keys wins we have had on the trade front over the last few years. Those wins include restoring beef access to South Korea, a potential market of $30 million by 2015; expanding access for canola to China, a market worth $1.6 billion; and, just recently, expanding access for our beef to Japan, which will double our market there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364253">I understand that numbers being put out there sometimes confuse people, but the bottom line is this: our Manitoba producers, our Canadian farmers, our food processors and our economies depend on trade to prosper.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="10">(2110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364254">What would the bill do to ensure a more efficient and reliable rail system for farmers? Most importantly, the fair rail freight service act would give shippers new tools to level the playing field in their relationship with the railways. The fundamental change would help to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted delivery of Canadian products to our customers. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is backing this commitment with the crop logistics working group, which provides a forum for transportation-related issues. On November 20, 2012, the <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> announced a new mandate for this working group to continue finding efficiencies and driving costs out of the entire food value chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364255">We all know that the potential for growth lies beyond our borders in this great country, and our Conservative government continues to work closely with industry to open up new markets while strengthening and expanding our existing trade relationships. We cannot afford to put that business at risk. Canadian grain farmers and grain marketers have sales orders to fill around the world and are heavily dependent on the railways to move their product to market. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364268">Mr. Speaker, we have noticed in the northwest of B.C. that because of the system we have established, where there is often a monopoly of service to some of the shippers, that CN, in the case of the people I represent, has been less than forthcoming about getting cars, especially on any of the spur lines. Lumber mills or grain shippers who happen to be slightly off the main line have an incredibly hard time finding a company that is willing to deal with them. There have been a lot of complaints lodged with the Competition Bureau, et cetera, and so on down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364269">I wonder if my colleague is satisfied that the changes being made here would provide some of those sawmills with service. I am talking about Burns Lake and Fort St. James, and places that are keeping their mills going but just hanging on. The idea that cars do not show up is unacceptable. They are willing shippers. They are willing consumers. They have the money and they have the product to move but they are too small sometimes, it would seem, for CN and these large players. We have afforded them this monopoly in a lot of cases. They do not have access to another way of getting their product to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364270">Would this legislation satisfy what these shippers, sawmills and grain shippers are going to need? As he said at the beginning of his remarks, we only get a few chances to get this thing right. We do not look at reforming our rail too often, and it has been wrong for a while, particularly for these types of producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364271">I wonder if he has anything in this legislation that would offer those good people a solid sense that they will be able to be viable in today's competitive market.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364272">Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that no matter how big or how small we are in this industry, it is individual producers who ship grain cars. They are reliant on not only agreements but on working arrangements with the rail line companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364273">For the shippers and the people who use that service, with the ability to have service agreements and contracts, a commercial deal will always stand up.

To a person they suggested to us that the shipping, through the west coast particularly, had become better than ever before. We have obviously seen an increase in wheat grown this year, and I think it is because of the freedom of choice that people have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364280">The fact that agreements can be struck with any individual, any organization or any business suggests that the companies, particularly the rail companies, are very serious about doing business.

If either one makes a mistake or creates an impasse, there are legal ways of resolving it and coming to the solution and ways of moving forward without being tied up.

              <ParaText id="3364301">Mr. Speaker, thank you for attempting to regain a little order. It is much appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364302">What I was saying was that there is significant disappointment, not just in the House but in the shipping community. The legislation does not fully achieve the objectives that the shipping community had been hoping for. They have been waiting for this legislation for a long time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364303">The debate about level of service agreements in the country began in 2006-2007. Before that period of time, the focus was on costing agreements and the level of freight rates and whether or not farmers and other shippers were receiving the full value that they thought they should receive. The argument was all about having costing reviews and the timeliness of costing reviews, what revenue was raised by freight rates and how it was shared or not shared across the entire continuum, from the shipper to the port and ultimately to export destinations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364304">In 2006-2007, the focus really zeroed right in on the issue of level of service agreements. That is when this debate really began. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364305">The government took a while to think about that, but in 2008, the government said it agreed that there was a legitimate issue, that service levels might well be deficient and there ought to be a review of the level of service provided by the railways to the various shippers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364306">I should make the point that we are not talking here about just the agricultural sector. As large and as important as the agricultural sector is, the shipper community includes those who move virtually anything by rail. It includes the forestry sector, the chemicals sector, the fertilizer sector, mines and minerals, and manufactured goods. It is a broad cross-section of those who rely upon our railway system. They made the general complaint that they thought the services they were getting were in fact deficient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364307">As I said, the government agreed in principle, but there was an issue here, starting in 2008, and it said it would have a formal review. That review panel was appointed in the fall of 2009. It got to work pretty quickly and completed its work in about a year. It finished its report in the fall of 2010. The report was officially published at the beginning of 2011 and by about March, the government said it accepted the report of the review panel and that it intended to implement the report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364308">The panel essentially said that the marketplace for transportation services was basically a non-competitive marketplace, that there was not a fair balance between the shippers on one side and the railways on the other and that there was indeed an imbalance of market power that was biased in favour of the railways. That report of the review panel appointed by the government came out at the beginning of 2011. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364309">In March of 2011 the government said that it essentially accepted that principle and that it would do something about it. The discussion continued to go on without a specific proposal from the government. In fact, it referred the whole matter back to another review process, chaired by Mr. Jim Dinning from Alberta. He was not able to move the yardsticks any further in trying to reach consensus between the railways and the shippers, so the process dragged on through 2011 and through 2012. By the end of 2012, in December of last year, the government finally tabled legislation. We are now halfway through 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364310">I would just remind the House that this whole process began in 2007. It has been a long time, and the shippers have waited patiently for legislation that they hoped would address their concerns. Unfortunately, they are disappointed. They find this legislation to be deficient. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364311">The shippers essentially wanted four things in the legislation. First, they wanted in legislation the enshrined right that they would be entitled to an enforceable level of service agreement with the railways. That was number one.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364312">Number two, they wanted the legislation to lay out what constitutes the basic services that the railways are to provide and how performance or non-performance would be measured. That was their second request. They wanted some clarity and some specificity about what constitutes service and how it is measured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364313">Number three, they wanted it very clear that if there were a breakdown somehow in the system, if the level of service that they contracted for was not in fact delivered as promised, then they would be entitled to recoup damages for the deficient service that they were delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364314">I would note that the review panel had reported, when it examined all of the anecdotes presented by shippers, that the typical agricultural shipper in western Canada could expect to get exactly what it ordered from the railways only 50% of the time. That is a pretty compelling statistic. If we can count on the transportation we have ordered to deliver only 50% of the time, we have a big problem if we are relying upon the railways to actually perform in that manner. Obviously the situation was serious and the shippers wanted the opportunity to recoup damages. They hoped they would not have to do that, but they wanted the opportunity to recoup damages if in fact the level of service fell below what was expected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364315">Finally, the fourth element was the dispute resolution mechanism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364316">The right to have a level of service agreement was point number one. They could negotiate that. If the negotiations were not successful, then it would be referred by arbitration to the Canadian Transportation Agency and the agency would impose an arbitrated agreement. That actually is in the law and that is a good part of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. It is the other elements of the ask that are missing. The clarity with respect to the definition of what services are to be provided and the consequences if the level of performance falls short. In other words, the ability by the shippers to recoup damages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364317">Those two things, the clarity of the definition and the ability to recover damages, are not in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. Those are the two primary reasons why the shipping community feels that this legislation is deficient.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364318">The government's answer with respect to the definition of level of service is that it is just going to rely upon the traditional language that has been in the Canadian Transportation Act for 40 or 50 years and it does not need to upgrade that language or make it any more specific to satisfy the concerns of shippers. I think quite frankly that the government is going to find out that this is a false conclusion on its part. The definition in the act is what has caused the problem in many ways over the last number of years. It is not clear. It is like nailing Jello to the wall. To simply say, “we're going to carry on with those same definitions of service levels in the future and cross our fingers and hope for the best”, the government, the shippers and the railways are going to be disappointed. The language has proven to be deficient in the past and the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364319">We are not going to get a different result, so the definition in this legislation is not adequate to change the water on the beam, to solve the problem that the shippers have been complaining about and that the government's own review panel concluded was in fact a legitimate problem and that the shippers were not crying wolf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364320">Second, on the issue of enforcement, what happens when the level of service turns out to be deficient and it does not measure up to the standards that the shippers have every right to expect? The government's answer is not to give the shippers damages. The government's answer is to establish a system of administrative monetary penalties, in layman's language, fines for railway substandard performance. Some might think that is a kind of penalty and enforcement mechanism, would that not work? The problem is the fine goes to the government. It goes into the general revenue fund. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364321">It simply becomes an additional revenue source for the treasury of the Government of Canada and bears no relationship whatsoever to the transportation problem out in the field. What the shippers need is the ability to recover damages. If a shipment is not delivered on time and it misses a customer or a market, that is a monetary penalty that shippers have to pay. They lose income, lose profit and incur added costs because the transportation system has failed them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364322">It does them no good whatsoever to say we will slap the railways on the wrist and they will pay a fine to the government. That does not move an extra bushel of wheat, that does not move an extra tonne of lumber. All it does is transfer a bit of money from the railways to the government. Meanwhile, the shipper is stuck with the same problem: deficient service for which there is no remedy because they cannot recover damages unless they go through the elaborate process of going to court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364323"> We just had a discussion about small shippers and the disadvantages they have. The railways have deeper pockets for the lawyers in the court process than the shippers have and, undoubtedly, that imbalance will continue to function in favour of the railways and to the disadvantage of the shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364324">Probably the greatest illustration of the discrepancy remains on the playing field. Remember, the panel said the original problem was a lack of balance on the playing field. It was tilted in favour of the railways and the shippers were largely in a captive market situation. They were not in a position to find some other railway to move their product and they were not in a position to enforce their legal rights because they did not have the legal rights, so they were stuck in a disadvantageous position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364325">Perhaps the greatest illustration of that discrepancy is the fact that railways can, and always have been able to, level unilateral demurrage charges against the shipper if the shipper fails to deliver their side of the bargain on time or in the way the railways had expected. The railways can extract a cash penalty from a shipper called demurrage if the shipper falls down on its obligations, but on the flip side of the equation, the shipper does not have the ability to recover a cash penalty or cash damages from the railways if the railways fail to perform. Therefore, the railways have the power to punish the shippers, but the shippers do not have the power to punish the railways. That is a classic illustration of the fundamental market imbalance that exists in this situation and the imbalance that the shippers had hoped would finally be rectified by this new legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364326">Those are the fundamental problems. The legislation creates, to a certain extent, some steps forward. There will be a legislated right on the part of all shippers to have level of service agreements with the relevant railways. They can first try to negotiate those agreements and if the negotiations succeed, great. Everybody hopes that is the way it will work, that they will not need recourse to the legislative and regulatory framework so that the parties will be able to work out a deal. However, if the shipper is not able to successfully conclude an agreement with the railways, the legislation takes an additional step, which is good, in saying that the shipper can then to go to the Canadian Transportation Agency and get an arbitrated settlement from the agency. Those steps in the legislation are positive steps forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364327">However, let me repeat that where it falls down is in the language that is in the act or, more accurately, that is not in the act defining what “level of service” means. The same vague old language is being used that has been there for decades and that vague old language is part of the problem. There needs to be greater clarity about what constitutes level of service and the way level of service is measured. The second major deficiency is that when there is a failure to perform on the part of the railways, there is no ability on the part of the shipper to go to the Canadian Transportation Agency through some form of dispute settlement process and obtain liquidated damages to address the practical problem that the shipper has, that their goods are not moving because the railways have failed to perform. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364328">Paying a penalty to the government does not do the shipper any good. The money is in the pocket of the government, not in the pocket of the shipper and the shipper is the one that has experienced the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364329">Those are the issues that were discussed at committee. Those are the issues that members of this House, both in committee and otherwise, have discussed with the shipping community across the country. They say that, because of the legal provision in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> that would create the right to have a level of service agreement, the legislation is a step forward. It is, as they put it to me both verbally and in writing, better than nothing. They would like substantially more, but it is better than nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364330">On that basis, that it is some small improvement over what has existed in the past, Liberals will be reluctantly supporting this legislation. We would prefer to have it vastly improved. There still is an opportunity to do that. The parliamentary process is not yet complete. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364331">Hopefully before it is complete and before this legislation is given royal assent, the government will have the opportunity to reflect on those two key points. First, a more effective definition of level of service and the way it is measured; second, the way proper service is enforced by the railways, by giving the rights to the shippers to have liquidated damages, as opposed to just a penalty paid to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364332">If the government would change those two things, the shipper community members would be a lot more satisfied with this legislation than they are today. I think all of us are reluctantly accepting it the way it stands, but the government will find it will be revisiting this issue in a year or two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364333">There is a statutory review of the Canada Transportation Act in the year 2015. This is going to come back again, because this time the government has not seized the opportunity to do it right, the way it should have.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364337">Mr. Speaker, questions about existing service agreements between some shippers, certainly not nearly all of them, but some have over the last number of years been able to negotiate some kinds of confidential contracts with the railways to deal with their level of service. Those contracts are confidential between the railway and the shipper and their content, in terms of how effectively they deal with the service issues between the two parties, is not a matter that is on the public record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364338">However, the hon. member is correct to say that in those cases where a service agreement, such as it is, exists at the moment, the shipper is not entitled to refer the matter to the CTA unless and until that existing confidential contract expires. This may mean that some shippers might have to wait for some period of time before they would have access to the arbitration process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364339">We asked a number of questions in the committee about the existence of these pre-existing confidential contracts between some shippers and some railways. We were told that there were not very many of them and they were all pretty well of short duration. That was the testimony before the committee by the parties directly involved. We were given to understand that this was not a large problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364340">However, if in fact there turn out to be more of these confidential agreements already existing than we were led to believe there were and if they are of longer duration, five or ten years rather than one or two, then I think there will be a problem with the legislation because a significant number of shippers would then be excluded from the right to have arbitration for some considerable length of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364341">However, according to the shippers themselves, when we asked them the question on how many of these agreements existed now and how long they lasted, there were not very many of them and they did not last very long. That was the testimony they gave before the committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364345">The fact is that in 1995, the issue that was largely before the railway community and the shipping community was a question about costing. The last costing review was done in about 1992. Through the 1990s that was the question the shipping community was concerned about: a costing review; were the revenues being raised; were they accurately measured; were they properly distributed among the various participants in the value chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364346">The discussion about level of service began in earnest in the mid-2000s. It was a focus of debate, particularly, starting in 2006-2007. There was legislation going through Parliament at about that time. The shipping community said that it would like to have the level of service issue attached to the legislation the government had brought in, I believe, in 2006 and was dealing with in 2007. The government's response to that was, “We'll deal with the level of service complaints at a later stage”, and that is what produced the panel, which started in 2008-2009.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364355"> Quite frankly, the issue of private ownership or public ownership of the railways is, in these circumstances, entirely irrelevant. The shippers have had complaints about both sides of the equation, both the privately-owned railway, and while it was still in the public domain, the publicly owned railway. The point is that the ownership structure of the railway has proven to be irrelevant on the question of level of service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364356">At the moment, if we asked the shippers, they would be discrete in answering, but they would say that they are getting a better level of service from CN than from CP.

              <ParaText id="3364360">Mr. Speaker, the issue with respect to what historically was called the “Crow's Nest rate” is that it ran into a serious impediment in the mid-1990s with the new World Trade Organization, which explicitly ruled that this form of structure in our freight rates constituted an illegal subsidy for the future. Accordingly, the government had to react with changes that provided a period of compensation for the loss of the subsidized rate and it tried to put the system on a more commercial basis for the long term into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364361"> That was a very difficult transition for farmers. Those in the farming community in our country deserve a great deal of credit for having the strength and ingenuity to work their way through that period of great change and emerge successfully at the other side. However, they now need fair legislation that will give them the service they are paying for, and that is why Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> should be better than it is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364362">Mr. Speaker, I take great interest in the debate this evening, as well as a bit of pride, because this legislation is very close to me. I was in charge of the railways at the time when the rail freight service review was happening and on behalf of the government, I was able to introduce the announcement to initiate this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364363">Here we are going into third reading, which is great not only for the House but for the country because all parties are indicating their support for the legislation. It is a great legislation for a lot of reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364364">I will start with why it is here and why we need the legislation. I would like to go back a bit and explain to the House and Canadians what the problem really was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364365">At the time when I was put in charge of railways, in western Canada the on-time delivery for CN's cars was about 52% to 55% for grain shipments. That is not a good performance. How could western Canadian farmers get their products from the combine to the port and off to international markets when they could only rely on the cars being there at the proper time 55% of the time?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364366">As my hon. colleague from Wascana mentioned, during the review CN upped its game considerably. New management came into CN and really concentrated on trying to up its game at the time, and it did. It went from 55% to over 90% within about a year to a year and a half period. That was strictly because the spotlight was on it and it put full attention toward upping its service because the service review was taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364367"> A lot of the shippers came to us and asked that we keep the review going and keep the spotlight on the industries and the railways so they would up the game. We encouraged them to continue to have service agreements with all their shippers. They committed to doing that and signed as many shipping service agreements as they possibly could. In fact, I know there were some in some of the industries, perhaps the coal industry, for over a decade, so there were some long-term agreements that were signed at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364368">This legislation does not really speak to the agreements. That is intentional because they are so diverse. Producers cars would have a completely different need and service agreement than would shipping of a coal, potash or forest industries. However, they all want service. Under this legislation, those agreements would be totally flexible because they could contain all kinds of penalties. We are not privy to what the agreements are. We do not need to know what they are. However, when the two parties come to an agreement, they need to have some kind of mechanism to do things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364369">The first is to ensure that whatever agreement they do reach is complied with. That is what this legislation does. It has penalties that would go to either a shipper or a railway depending on which one breaches the agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364370">The second is there for when an agreement cannot be reached. If negotiations between the shipper, the railway, and so forth are done to the best of their ability, whether in the forest, egg, coal or potash industry, whatever the commodity, yet they cannot come to an agreement, then they are really stuck. This legislation is a way for them to reach a final arbitrated settlement that would give them clarity as to what was fair in an agreement. That is what the industry and the shippers have asked for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364371"> Instead of being held ransom and saying they cannot come up with an agreement because no one wants to negotiate, they are saying, with this legislation, that if they cannot come to an agreement, there will be an arbitrated settlement. It does not say who is going to win or lose in that arbitration. Rather it calls for that to happen. Because of that, there will be a better system all the way around. If we go through the rail service review data carefully, as did the committee and the government, there was a lot of blame on both the shipper and the railway sides.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364372">Let us not pick winners or losers. Let us just fix it in the best interests of this country. That is what this House is all about. It is about designing a piece of legislation that will move the country along. We do not really care who wins or loses. We want it to be fair so that both win. Canada wins because we move product to shore and on to international markets, where the real win is for the railways, the shippers and the country. That is why this should be supported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364373">International trade is really our stimulus for the future. We just came through a tremendous economic recession that has challenged the world. It challenged North America. It challenged the United States, our largest trading partner. Last year we had $528 billion in trade. Three-way trade between Mexico, Canada and the United States is almost $1 trillion per year. That is a large number, when we start talking about trillions of dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364374">About 40 million jobs have been created in our country because of NAFTA. I love the map at the Canadian embassy in the United States. The map shows for each state the number of dollars traded with Canada and the number of jobs created in that state because of that trade. It is very effective information that our American cousins need to understand more directly. Canadians also need to understand it. The number of dollars traded and the number of jobs created in each province is also on that map. I would recommend it to anyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364375">Why do I mention that? It is because one of every five jobs in Canada is created because of trade, because of exports. Sixty per cent of our GDP is from that trade. Is it growing or is it shrinking? The last statistics I saw show a 73% increase in trade internationally between now and 2025. That is a large number. Those countries that capitalize on that growth in trade are the ones that are going to win. I like the way we are positioned to capitalize on that. We are about to sign a European free trade agreement, which I hope will work. That is 500 million people and $17 trillion in GDP in that market that we will be able to capitalize on. Not only that, but when we go to the west coast, with the trans-Pacific partnership, we will be talking about 110 million people and GDP of $17.6 trillion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364376">These are tremendous opportunities, not only with respect to China and India but with the trans-Pacific partners. It will depend on what we have to offer those markets. We are also working on a bilateral trade agreement with Japan. We are working on more trade with China. China is a big player, particularly when it comes to railways and moving products to the west coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364377">What do they want? They want two things: food security and energy security. Canada can provide both, and railways are a major part of that. Before railways and shippers start saying negative things about each other, why do both groups not look at the opportunity before us? Why do we not look at the opportunity before Canada? Never has the opportunity been greater to create a winning situation for Canadian industries. It might be products manufactured and moved back and forth by rail, as we do with United States when we move automobiles back and forth by rail. We can actually supply for the United States products coming from China through the port of Prince Rupert two and a half days faster than any other port on the west coast. It is two and a half days faster, because it comes through Prince Rupert and goes right down to Chicago to supply the largest economy in the world: the United States. It is because of our railways and our system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364378">People have been criticizing this piece of legislation and asking why we did not include shipments to the United States in this rail service agreement. I can say that the United States is looking very closely at this piece of legislation. Americans are wondering how it is working, what kind of support it is getting and if it is going to actually do the job. I believe that it will do the job. The Americans are very keen to look at it and perhaps even use it as a model for their country. When that happens, there will be a continuous system between Canada and the United States, which is our largest trading partner and always will be.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364379">This is a great piece of legislation for many reasons. When we look at the international markets, it is indeed amazing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364380">The railways carry a tremendous amount of freight, about 240 million tonnes of freight. About 70% of the surface freight in this country is moved by rail. That includes the bulk commodities such as grains, minerals, forestry products, energy products and so on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364381">I was talking to a representative of CN last night. He was telling me that the number of cars they are ordering to supply energy to markets by rail is off the charts. That is happening because of the resistance to pipelines. Whether or not the pipelines come, there is no question that rail will play a big part in moving our energy products to shore and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364382">It is very important that this piece of legislation work not only for the agriculture sector, for grains and seeds, but for the energy sector, mining, potash and so on. It is a great piece of legislation that would go a long way in making certain that we level the playing field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364383">My hon. colleague said that CN used to be one of the worst as far as providing service. I would tend to agree with him. Perhaps now the reverse is happening, and CP is having more of a struggle providing service than CN. That is hard to argue with, and it is probably true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364384">We have heard arguments from the president of CN. He is asking why we are bringing in this legislation. He says that it will halt negotiations and drive people away from the negotiating table. It would do just the opposite. It would drive people to the negotiating table, because if they did not get a service agreement, there would be a very quick arbitration process in place through this legislation that would actually make sure they got a deal. That is what the legislation is designed to do. That is why it would work so well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364385">Would it be used an awful lot? Probably not. I hope not. I hope it is never used. If we bring it in, the jig is up. There should be an arbitrated settlement. If there is not, somebody will do it for them. They will do it quickly, and it will not cost a lot of money. Once the process has been challenged, a precedent will be set. The rest will fall in line with it, and the service agreements will comply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364386">I do not believe that this piece of legislation will be used terribly much, but it needs to be there, because the manager of CN or CP may not always be the most friendly guy who always wants to do the right thing. When we bring in legislation, it is for a long period and it is in the best interests of the country. It has nothing to do with the personalities of the people who were there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364387">I remember the forest industry. We were within hours of finalizing an agreement with the forest sector of this country. We brought them to the table. We did everything we possibly could to get them over the line. We could not quite get there. We would get there now, because we would have a piece of legislation that would arbitrate it. I will not say who would win or lose in that arbitration, because I do not know, but I do know that there would be an arbitrated settlement and they would move on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364388">It is really important that cars are placed in yards at the appropriate time for product to move from where it is produced to the market. That is the number one thing we can do to create the kind of economy, jobs and prosperity this country needs to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364389">A lot has been said about the penalties that would go to the government. That is because we do not want winners or losers to use this piece of legislation other than as a tool to make certain that services are provided at the appropriate time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364390">There could be all kinds of penalties within their service agreements if the parties agreed to them. If the agreements were not recognized and not realized, the penalties would be a tool to make sure the service agreement was complied with.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364391">It is a very great day for me. This has been a long process. It is a process that has had a lot of consultation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364392">I have quotes here from the agricultural, forestry, coal, potash and mining industries that say that this is a very big step in changing the dynamic between the railways and the shippers. They feel that they have a government that will back them in an arbitrated settlement process that does not play one against the other. It is truly there to try to make certain that an agreement works for both and that the service is provided in an appropriate way. Predictable service is something we cannot talk enough about. Unpredictable service is the number one thing that will retard the opportunity for shippers to be prosperous and get their products to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364393">I want to commend the standing committee on transport. It worked very hard over a number of years to make this happen. The <Affiliation DbId="191921" Type="96">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> has picked this ball up and has pushed it very hard. He has worked very hard to bring this to where it is tonight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364394">Tonight is a wonderful evening. Think about it. When was the last time we had a substantive piece of legislation such as this that was agreed upon by everyone in the House? I can think back a long time. I know that there have been frivolous pieces of legislation that perhaps have had unanimous consent, but there have not been major pieces of legislation like this that are paradigm shifters that would change the dynamic. It is probably the most significant piece of legislation to come between shippers and railways in 50 years or more, so this is a very significant evening. It is a significant piece of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364395">I am very proud to be lending my voice to it, and I look forward to the vote, which I hope will happen tomorrow. We will move it into the Senate and on to royal assent very quickly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364400">I believe that it is significant enough.

              <ParaText id="3364401">What is done for one is the same for the other. The penalty can be for the shipper as well as the railway.

All we are saying is that if the agreement is not complied with, the penalties will apply. There needs to be a tool to make sure that whatever is agreed upon is actually complied with, and that is what this legislation would do. Complying with the agreement should not be a winner or loser within the agreement to use as a tool. If someone wants compensation, it should be put in the agreement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364422">Mr. Speaker, if the president of CN, Claude Mongeau, had impact on the minister, the bill would not be here. I have sat down with him a number of times, and he said we should not do it. He gave me all kinds of reasons why it would be a terrible piece of legislation. The railways are not really excited about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364423">My argument to him was that if the railways do not want the bill, then they should have service agreements, and if they do not want service agreements, then they need the bill to be able to get them over the line. I would suggest that there is no impact there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364424">This is not a piece of legislation that either of the railways is excited about or interested in. They see the rationale behind the legislation. They are not supportive of the bill, but they are not saying anything very negative about it either. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364426">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Yellowhead for his wise counsel on tonight's debate. As he said, as we go after these international markets with our trade agenda, which is going to be so important for the expanding of our economy, as we see with oil pipelines, they end up being a network that joins job centres together. A rail network is very much like that as well. It is a network that joins job centres together. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364428">Mr. Speaker, my colleague is absolutely right. The creation of jobs and the growing of our economy is absolutely critical, and the railways play a major role in that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364429">As a government, we have been able to put a significant number of dollars into infrastructure to make certain that the gateway project on the west coast, the corridor project to the south, and the eastern project corridor to the east capitalize on those international markets. The infrastructure that is built there would not only creates jobs, but it would also create an infrastructure that would create jobs because of the kind of trade we are expecting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364430">We are a blessed country in so many ways and have so much opportunity, especially as we see this massively growing international trading relationship around the world. Healthy railways lend themselves to the success of our country and the kinds of job opportunities we will have for the future. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364431">Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364432"> Before I get going, I cannot help but mention that here we are, trying to debate an important piece of legislation, and yet the government has moved time allocation once again. This is the 37th time. What does the government have against parliamentary democracy? Why is it so determined to shut down debate and to prevent members of Parliament from having their say on important pieces of legislation? My colleague said how important this legislation is, and because it is so important, I am very disappointed that the Conservatives had to use these tactics yet again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364433">When we look at this bill, it actually gives our rail freight customers, or shippers, the right to service agreements with rail companies, especially CN and CP. It also puts into place, as my colleague said, a Canadian Transportation Agency-led arbitration process for failed negotiations, and penalties for violating the arbitration results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364434">This all sounds good, but I want us to take a look at what this means. By the way, we are speaking in favour of this bill. However, we do not believe this bill is complete. It does not address all the issues that the shippers, farmers and everybody needed it to address, but it does go part of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364435">We call this bill a baby step in the right direction. As good behaviour should always be rewarded, it is a piece of legislation going in the right direction. We have heard that this will not alleviate all the challenges faced by the shippers but it will go a long way in addressing a few of them. It is one of those cases of “better something than nothing”. That is why we are supporting this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364436">At this time I want to acknowledge the work done by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> on this file. She is an amazing critic for the transportation file. She is dedicated, passionate and has worked incredibly hard with different organizations of shippers, and representatives from the mining companies, the pulse growers, the Canadian Wheat Board, the automotive industry, as well as the mineral and chemical companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364437">It is her commitment, compassion and not letting go of this issue that I believe has forced the Conservative government to bring this bill to this House right now. Quite honestly, they have been dilly-dallying over this piece of legislation for a very long time, long after the report was out. They have had lots of time to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364438">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> has a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="5620079" Type="4">C-441</Document>, rail customer protection act. It is her absolute advocacy and outreach, and that kind of work in the House, as well as the pressure from the shipping community, that has put pressure on the Conservatives to table legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364439">I think we should always give credit when members of Parliament put in an incredible amount of work to benefit our farmers, mining companies, automotive companies that have to move cars, and, of course, all the other resource industries as well, including forestry. We are absolutely delighted with the work that the member has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364440">I also want to pick up on something that was said just a few minutes ago. CN made a profit of $2.7 billion in 2012, in one year, yet when I look at the penalty they will face, it is $100,000. By the way, that penalty is not paid to the shippers; it will be paid to the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="25">(2225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364441">I look at that and ask which lobby group has been successful. One just has to take a look at this bill. I have talked with shippers in my riding and visited a port where grains and legumes come in. This is when I learned something absolutely amazing, which you will be surprised at as well, Mr. Speaker. Did members know that Canada is the largest provider of pulses to India? In my naiveté, I always thought that lentils, chickpeas and all of those legumes were being brought to Canada from India and other countries. I was quite shocked to find out it was the opposite. It was the Canadian consul in Chandigarh who told me. He presented the figures and asked me if I knew that Canada is the largest exporter of legumes to India. A lot of those legumes go through the port of Vancouver and the port of Delta. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364442">What I have heard from business people in my community, those who receive and ship, is the travesty that exists right now. They actually have to wait, sometimes for days and days, because the promised carriages do not arrive. If they are slow to unload a trolley—I think it is called a trolley—when it arrives, they end up having to pay fines, but there are no consequences for the railway companies if they are late, do not send enough trolleys or if the trolleys that arrive are damaged and, therefore, cannot be used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364443">I looked at the ledger with one of these business people in great detail, who wanted to show me the impact it was having on his business. Let us say that he does not get the shipment on time, that the shipment of pulses that arrives from the Prairies does not get to his place on time. In the meantime, he not only has trucks and truck drivers waiting but labourers waiting to unload, and he has time booked at the port. Guess what? He has to pay all of them, through no fault of his own, just because the railway company is delayed or because it does not deliver all the trolleys he was expecting on that date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364444">I thought it must just be a few dollars here and there. I was surprised at how much these shippers pay if they do not empty the trolleys on time. However, I was also shocked at the port fees they still had to pay if they did not take up their spots and how the costs escalated the longer they waited. Really, we are not talking about simple costing. This bill has compensation—no, not compensation, a slight penalty for the railway companies of $100,000 when they make $2.7 billion in profit. Guess who that money goes to? It does not go to offset the real costs incurred by the shippers and receivers, those who grow and ship the goods. That money goes to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364445">I have been shaking my head on that one, thinking this makes very little sense. Does the government really have a vested interest in making sure that this new piece of legislation really works, if it knows that every time CN Rail is late, it is going to get $100,000? That does not seem like a penalty. It seems like the government has built in a bonus for itself. We really have to take a look at that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="30">(2230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364446">Our railway system is the backbone of our country. There is no doubt about it. From some of the early CP and CN stories we have all read about, glorious or not so glorious, we know that 70% of our surface goods are moved by rail. That is a significant amount. When we say that there are shippers who actually suffer the consequence of this, we are not talking about a small number of people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364447">This is another figure that absolutely astounded me. It is that 80% of service commitments for agricultural rail customers are not met by rail companies. I think 80% would get a big F if I were grading them for service. Let us say, out of 100 times, 80 times they fail to meet their deadlines. We are talking about produce that has to be moved quickly and people are waiting for it. We are also talking about some produce that could get spoiled, but we are also talking about the ricochet or cascading costs that I just mentioned earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364448">There are delays. There are insufficient numbers of rail cars. Some rail cars arrive and they are damaged. Sometimes they order 12 rail cars and guess how many arrive? For one person I was talking to, shippers might only get half the rail cars they ordered. That puts all kinds of stress on the system. Once again, when we look at the losses incurred by the shippers, the bill fails to address that. I would urge my colleagues, even at this late stage because it is in their hands, to really take a look at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364449">The rail freight service review said that 80% of shippers are not satisfied. By the way, we are not talking about one industry. Of course agriculture plays a huge role in this area, but we are also talking about forestry, natural resources, manufactured goods, mining, chemicals and as I said earlier, all the agricultural belt. Key stakeholders in agriculture, mining and forestry industries, not just individual people but associations representing these industries, have been calling for freight legislation for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364450">Let me give some examples: Pulse Canada, Grain Growers of Canada, Forestry Products Association of Canada and the Mining Association of Canada. Once again I would say that as I have talked with many business people in my community who are involved in the shipping industry they have been so full of praise for the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> who has done such great work on this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364451">Canada's shippers deserve fair and reliable rail freight service for the good money they are paying. Right now with the way our country is, CN and CP seem to hold a dual monopoly. The impact of that monopoly has not been addressed by Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> because the one area that has not been addressed is pricing. That is a critical part as well, and it is not only pricing, but also the fact that there is no compensation for the shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364452">There were six recommendations from the shipping community at the committee stage, sensible, practical and modest. They were all rejected. This is an all too familiar pattern. I sit at the immigration committee as vice-chair, and it does not seem to matter what amendments we propose. Even amendments that the minister thinks would be really good ones because we take up his wording just get rejected.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364453">However, these were not amendments from the opposition. These were amendments suggested by the shipping community, the business community, the people who are the backbone of this country who pay taxes and who were looking to the government to show them a level playing field. Once again, the government has failed to show a level playing field to all the industries I mentioned, including agriculture. Once again, it has chosen to stand closer to the big corporate friends like the railway lines, CP and CN. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364454">Members know that the NDP is not going to give up. We are not planning to go away. We are planning to work harder than ever. We will continue to work with the shipping community to tackle the issue of gouging through uncompetitive rail freight rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364455">Do members know what? This was an opportunity for the government to address that issue, to take a holistic approach, instead of taking a baby step, a very tiny baby step. In here, we can talk about the economy. We can talk about growing jobs. We can talk about all kinds of issues. However, here was a concrete opportunity for the current government to do something that would help to bolster our economy, agriculture, the mining industry, the forestry industry and the automotive industry. Once again, it was very short-sighted and just decided to take a baby step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364456">One of the key things we have to take a look at is that when we look at the moving of goods and think that 70% of our surface goods are moved by rail, in this huge country—and by the way, as we know, moving goods by rail is much more environmentally sound than it is to move them by road—the government had an opportunity, at this time, to support the pulse growers, the grain growers, the mining industry and the forestry industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364457">We know that disruptions to rail freight services and unacceptable service costs cost the Canadian economy hundreds of millions of dollars every year. The businessmen I have talked to when I have taken a look at the losses they incur, when they incur those losses, they impact the community I live in. They impact right across this country. A few of the business people have been telling me that they absolutely—</ParaText>

Unfortunately, the government failed to grab that opportunity. However, I am glad that all parties in the House will support this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364502">I really need to mention this. It is the privatization of CN in 1995, under the Liberal watch, without any safeguard for shippers, that has led to our current virtual monopoly. That is one of our problems.

              <ParaText id="3364505">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, the fair rail freight service act. My comments today will describe our extensive consultations with stakeholders from across the rail-based supply chain. These consultations helped shape Bill C-52 and helped to ensure that it would take a fair and balanced approach to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and reliability of rail-based supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364506">In 2008, the government initiated the rail freight service review to address ongoing concerns regarding rail service. As part of the review, the government appointed an independent panel of three eminent persons. The panel's mandate was to provide recommendations on how to address rail service issues, including both commercial and, if necessary, regulatory solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364507">In issuing its recommendations, the panel consulted extensively and broadly with stakeholders in the rail-based supply chain. Indeed, the panel held broad consultations with 85 shippers, railways and other stakeholders and received over 140 written submissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364508">Taking full account of input provided by stakeholders, the panel submitted its final report to the government. The government carefully considered the panel's recommendations as well as stakeholder views presented during the review and announced a number of key commitments to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the rail-based supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364509"> A key commitment of our Conservative government was to develop legislation that would provide shippers the right to a service agreement and a process to establish one should commercial negotiations fail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364510">As part of our commitment for legislation, we launched a consultation process, inviting input from stakeholders. During the summer of 2012, we asked stakeholders for their views on the development of a new legislative provision to give shippers a right to a service agreement and on what process should be followed to establish one should commercial negotiations fail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364511"> The response from stakeholders was robust and fulsome. Extensive consultations spanned a number of months, including meetings with shippers, shipper associations and railways that provided the opportunity to listen to a diverse range of views regarding rail service issues and a legislative provision to address those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364512"> In addition, a variety of stakeholders provided extensive written input, including shippers, shipper associations, railways, provinces, municipal associations, ports and terminals. These stakeholders came from across the rail-based supply chain and had operations throughout various regions of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364513">I have described the formal processes of the review and our invitation to stakeholder input over the summer months of last year. I would also like to note that we have continued to hear the views of stakeholders on an ongoing and informal basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364514">Throughout these consultations, we heard from a diverse range of stakeholders, including large, medium and small shippers, shippers of various products, including agriculture products, coal, potash and forest products, ports and terminals from east and west coasts of Canada, class 1 and short line railways and other levels of government. We listened carefully to stakeholder views and considered their input to develop a legislative provision that would ensure the best possible outcomes for the supply chain as a whole, as well as for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364515">The fair rail freight service act responds to key points raised by stakeholders throughout the consultations, which I just described. For example, shippers reiterated that the legislation had to provide leverage in their negotiations with the railways to ensure they could get the rail service that met their needs. Shippers have also expressed that a process to establish agreements must be timely and efficient. Additionally, shippers have asked for a mechanism that would hold railways accountable for service failures.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="00">(2300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364516">We have heard these concerns. The bill provides every shipper with the right to a service agreement and a process to establish one where commercial negotiations fail. Service agreements would help give shippers more clarity on the rail service they can expect to receive. While we expect that most would be able to negotiate agreements commercially, the arbitration process ensures that shippers identify the elements to be addressed to ensure they can get the rail service that truly meets their needs. Furthermore, the arbitration process is 45 days and can be extended for up to another 20 days at the arbitrator's discretion. This timely process would allow shippers to focus their resources on growing their businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364517">In response to the request of the shippers for greater railway accountability, the bill provides for the Canada Transportation Agency to apply an administrative monetary penalty of up to $100,000 for each railway service failure. This is a strong mechanism to hold railways accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364518">The bill is a balanced approach, which is reflective of stakeholder views in several other respects as well. For example, both the shipper and the railway must first try to resolve the matter commercially. Should commercial negotiations fail, there is a process for an arbitrator to establish an agreement. The arbitrator would have sufficient flexibility to impose an agreement that is tailored to the given situation. In this flexibility, the bill recognizes that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and that railways have an obligation to provide service to all users on their network.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364519">It is clear that the fair rail freight service act is the product of listening to input provided by stakeholders. The bill's approach is firmly grounded in the views and concerns expressed by stakeholders from across the rail-based supply chain. This bill provides shippers with leverage to ensure they can negotiate with the railways to get the rail service that truly meets their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364520">Shippers have expressed their support for the bill, indicating that it meets their fundamental request for more leverage in their negotiations with railways. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> balances the requirements of the railways to provide adequate and suitable service to all other customers. The balanced approach responds to concerns raised by shippers and railways, but more importantly ensures that the Canadian economy is the ultimate winner. Efficient and reliable rail service is key to the long-term prosperity and growth of the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364521">To remain competitive in global markets, shippers have to get their products to market. Canadian shippers work hard to maintain their global reputation as reliable suppliers. To enhance Canada's international competitiveness, shippers need a fluid rail-based supply chain to move product from farms, mills and mines to market, in a predictable, reliable and efficient manner. The fair rail freight service act ensures shippers would get the rail service that meets their needs, allowing them to grow their businesses and take advantage of global market opportunities. Railways would be able to manage their networks in a manner that benefits all users, and the Canadian economy would be better positioned to take advantage of new opportunities, thereby supporting long-term economic growth and prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText>

First of all, there is the outstanding member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, our transport critic, who has been doing a great job for a long, long time. There is our wonderful deputy critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170320" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>, our exceptional colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170286" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170154" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>. Once again I would like to say that they are doing excellent work in committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364542"> It is now 11:10 p.m., and I am very proud to rise in the House, convinced as I am that it is important that we go on discussing this bill, that we go on arguing and explaining that, even though we are going to vote for the bill, it is only a first step. My colleague spoke very clearly on this point earlier, calling it a baby step. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364543"> It is a first step, a tiny baby step, even though shippers, farmers, mining companies and the various other companies that use the railways have been asking for this legislation to be reviewed for years now. Unfortunately, no one delivered on that, as the expression goes. The government has produced a bill that is very disappointing. We are going to accept it because it is a first step in the right direction, but considering the number of years that we have spent waiting for improvements, the government could have done better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364544"> On that point, in committee, and I mentioned this earlier during question period to the other members, and I want to say it again, there were six proposals made by shippers and businesses. Those six proposals were not asking too much. They were very reasonable, and they had been studied and analyzed and brought forward by experts. They were then assembled into nine amendments by the New Democrats and tabled in committee. We submitted those proposals in a very professional manner. As people who do their job properly, we decided that even though it was a bill from the Conservatives, we could improve it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364545"> Unfortunately, in their ideological blindness and their desire to get everything done fast and without consultation, thinking only of their own interests, the Conservatives brushed those proposals off. I am truly saddened to see that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364546"> I would like to talk about the Conservatives’ short-sightedness for a minute. As I said when I was asking questions, the railway is important not only for shipping freight, but also for transporting people. We should invest a lot more in shipping freight, and we should invest a lot more in transporting people. If shippers can rely on an efficient railway, they will use it more, and even more businesses will use it too. In Drummond, some businesses use it, but if it were more efficient, more businesses would use it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364547"> If we had a policy, a national public transit strategy, a national rail transportation strategy, as the New Democrats are calling for, and as the NDP’s excellent transport critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, is calling for, we could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and do a lot more to combat climate change.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="10">(2310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364548">The Conservatives do not think that combatting climate change should be a priority. I serve on the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and, unfortunately, this is the message we get week after week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364549">In the two years that I have been in the House of Commons, we have been told that combatting climate change should be the Canadian government's top priority. We are told that climate change is currently the government's major challenge and that it will be for future generations as well. It should be a priority in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364550">However, unfortunately for them, the Conservatives favour studies that are less pressing, when they should be addressing climate change, and making it a priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364551">The government should have a national public transit and rail transportation strategy to ensure on-time delivery. Currently, in 80% of cases, things go wrong, and 90% of shippers complain that they are dissatisfied with the service. Those are not passing grades. They do not encourage Canadians, shippers and big businesses to make more frequent use of rail transportation. Rail transportation should therefore be a part of a pan-Canadian strategy to combat climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364552">In the NDP, we are very proud to have this long-term vision, which is not just about the interests of big business, but also about the interests of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364553">On that note, Canada is the only G8 country to not have federal funding and a national plan for transportation. This attests to just how far we lag behind other nations, when we should, in fact, be dynamic leaders. In the NDP, our vision is clear and progressive. It demonstrates why it is important to reform the Canada Transportation Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364554">The NDP has three main demands regarding this bill. First, Canadian shippers deserve fair, reliable, bang-for-their-buck rail transportation. That is why it is important to strengthen the position of shippers vis-à-vis the CN and CP monopoly, which is something that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> fails to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364555">Shippers made six reasonable, practical, modest recommendations in committee. Unfortunately, the Conservators flatly rejected them all without giving them the time of day, while the New Democrats once again did all the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364556"> It is also important to remember that other improvements are necessary. For that reason, the NDP will continue to work very hard with shippers, forestry companies, mining companies and other businesses to improve the bill, which does not sufficiently address the issue of the lack of competition in this sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364557"> In closing, I repeat that we are going to support this bill. Unfortunately, it is only a baby step towards what should be accomplished, namely creating a national transportation strategy and a national strategy to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364558"> Those are the two greatest challenges for us to tackle on behalf of future generations, our children, our grandchildren and the people of Drummond, who come to see me often. They are worried about the environment and concerned about having a high-quality, efficient and reliable rail system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364559"> The NDP is here and will continue to work very hard for a better rail system and a better public transit system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364560">Mr. Speaker, I would like to put on record what works well when we let the industry work with the railways. Canpotex, which I mentioned earlier, is a shipper of potash and it recently signed 10-year agreements with CP Rail, CN Rail and UP Rail, which is Union Pacific. The agreements secured transportation for increasing export volumes with long-term customers in approximately 30 countries, a reliable and properly maintained railcar fleet that was essential. These were partnerships. These types of partnerships helped them achieve present and future logistic goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364561">That suggests to me that if we work with the industry and perhaps have good legislation in place that is not too intrusive, the industry will take care of itself. I might add, being that the member got a little carried away on the environment, Canpotex also contemplated building a new greenfield terminal on B.C.'s west coast of Prince Rupert. If we let the industry work and we work well with the industry, I think—</ParaText>

Unfortunately, as I mentioned, there were six proposals that were not answered and were simply dismissed. I cannot explain that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364564">I must also mention something very technical, as my colleague called it. Arbitration can pose a problem since it is only available for shippers who are negotiating new contracts. Consequently, shippers will have no right to arbitration for their older contracts. That was one of the proposals that was made and rejected so brusquely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364565">A number of proposals of that kind were made and, instead of providing rapid, reliable assistance to all shippers through a conflict resolution process, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> provides a limited arbitration procedure only for a small group of shippers. That is a good example of a situation the Conservative government has not been able to address, and it explains why the bill is unsatisfactory. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364575">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise this evening to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, the fair rail freight service act</Document>. The bill would amend the Canada Transportation Act to improve the reliability and predictability of rail freight service in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364576">From the birth of our nation at Confederation to the present, railways have played a very critical and significant role in the forming of our great country. However, the world has changed over this period. Revolutionized by changing technology, the globe has been made smaller by faster, more efficient means of transportation and communication.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364577">At the same time, the fundamentals of our economy have stayed the same. We are a trading nation and we need a transportation system to move our products to market. Nowadays shippers have a range of choices: air, rail, truck, marine when they transport their products to market. Shippers make business decisions regarding how best to transport their goods to market and the quality of service is a key component of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364578">The “just in time” world has changed customers' expectations of service, making them demand greater precision and reliability. The fierce competition of the global economy combined with Canada's size and proximity to markets increases the pressure on service as we compete to sell to the world. Each mode works to respond to these demands. In our diverse economy, a shipper's transportation requirements depend on what he or she needs to move and the best mode of transport to get it there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364579">For example, pharmaceutical companies rely on air cargo to move medicines around the globe quickly and under controlled conditions. Retailers rely on trucks to move food and consumer goods from distribution centres to stores to serve shoppers. Of course our natural resource sector and manufacturing sector rely on rail to move raw materials and finished goods such as automobiles to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364580">Our Conservative government has an interest in how the entire transportation system functions in support of the country's trade. Economic growth remains this government's top priority. This is demonstrated by our transportation and trade corridor initiatives that promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the system as a whole to bolster international trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364581">To keep our transportation system as competitive as possible, we work with other levels of government and multiple stakeholders to ensure that we have appropriate policies and programs in place. Effective rail policy and legislation is a core element of our Conservative government's approach to ensuring the transportation system remains prepared to support our trade agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364582">Rail plays a prominent role in our economic success because it creates efficiencies by its economies of scale. It offers a means to transport bulk commodities and heavy goods over long distances at a relatively low cost. Because of this, rail has remained a critical part of our economic success and our ability to trade, especially as we promote our responsible resource agenda. This is why our government has made rail freight service a priority and has brought forward Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364583">The Canada Transportation Act contains measures that contribute to the productive functioning of a rail-based supply chain and shippers' ability to obtain the rail service that they require.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="25">(2325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364584">The Canada Transportation Act provides a series of provisions that shippers can use to address rate and service issues. To start, if a shipper feels that a railway's rate is too high, the shipper can challenge the rate through the final offer arbitration provision of the Canada Transportation Act. Both the shipper and the railway present their cases before an arbitrator, and the arbitrator selects one of the offers to establish the rate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364585">In addition to the rate or the price for moving traffic, a shipper may feel that the railway's charges for additional services, such as the cleaning of cars, are too high. Through another provision in the Canada Transportation Act, the shipper can complain about such extra or ancillary charges to the Canadian Transportation Agency. If the agency finds the charges are unreasonable, the agency may establish new charges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364586">Finally, if a shipper feels that the railway has not been fulfilling its obligation to provide suitable and adequate service, the shipper can seek redress under the level of service complaint provision. The agency would investigate the complaint and determine whether the railway has fulfilled its obligations. The agency has broad powers to order corrective measures if it determines that the railway is not fulfilling its obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364587">The Canada Transportation Act clearly provides shippers with a suite of measures to help them manage their commercial relationship with the railways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364588">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would constitute a new provision on service to assist shippers. The new provision provided in the fair rail freight service act is an additional measure that would complement the existing suite of provisions under the Canada Transportation Act, some of which I have just described. The bill's goal is to provide shippers with the right to a service agreement and a process to establish one in the event that commercial negotiations fail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364589">Increasing the clarity and reliability of rail freight service is important to shippers. Shippers told us they would like to have a comprehensive service agreement in place in order to plan their business. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would provide this by giving the arbitrator the ability to impose detailed elements of service. Specifically, an arbitrator could establish operational terms that railways and shippers must follow to move traffic. This could include commercial or communication protocols, with internal escalation procedures and performance standards and metrics as appropriate. Operational plans to address potential service failures could include recovery plans to address how to recover from a force majeure, and finally, there could be the provision of incidental services by the railway and whether the railway can charge for the operational terms and incidental services that the railway is required to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364590">The new service arbitration provision would provide shippers with a fast 45-day process to have the terms of the rail freight service established if they cannot negotiate them commercially. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364591">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would create a new enforcement mechanism to hold railways accountable for providing the imposed service. Administrative penalties of up to $100,000 for violation could be issued to a railway company if the agency confirms a breach of an obligation in an imposed service contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364592">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would provide shippers with a powerful new tool to strengthen rail freight service, in addition to the existing provisions. Shippers would still retain the right to use any of the other measures in the act, which shippers told us was very important.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="30">(2330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364593">Shippers have supported the introduction of the bill as critical to addressing rail freight service issues and improving their leverage with the railways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364594">In conclusion, throughout the history of this great country, freight rail transportation has played a vital role in developing our economy. Many shippers rely on rail to get their products to market efficiently, predictably and at competitive costs. When they have challenges with their rail service or with rates, they can use existing measures in the Canada Transportation Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364595">The fair rail freight service act, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, responds to shippers' needs for better rail freight service.

              <ParaText id="3364602">The bills being discussed in the House are full of flaws. In fact, one of the many shortcomings that members have been discussing today is the fact that the maximum penalty for rail companies is $100,000. This $100,000 should be given to shippers to compensate them for lost productivity, delays and damage caused to harvests and products. However, in actual fact, this $100,000 goes directly to the federal government. That is not effective. The money is not going to the right place and, what is more, the fine is not even an effective deterrent. For example, in 2012, CN posted a $2.7 billion profit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364607">Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, the fair rail freight service act. The purpose of this bill would be to amend the Canada Transportation Act in order to improve the reliability and predictability of rail freight service in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364608">Over the past years, Canada's economy has managed to thrive amid a turbulent global economic downturn. Our success is in great part due to our Conservative government's focus on strengthening our economy. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would greatly improve Canada's rail freight service and consequently contribute to protecting and fostering the growth of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364609">A great number of Canadian businesses, from grain and forest products to coal and chemical products, use rail services to ship their goods across the country or around the world. The range of sectors that rely on rail is reflected in the range of witnesses who testified on this bill at the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities. As my colleague, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation>, said, “This bill is good news for Canada's farmers as it will help ensure all shippers are treated fairly by the railroads”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364610">Now let me explain how we reached the step of introducing this great legislation, and why all members of this Parliament should support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364611">The years prior to 2008 were a time of unprecedented growth. Increased trade with Asia contributed to capacity constraints in the transportation system. In 2008, the government launched the rail freight service review to look into issues of rail service reliability that were brought to our attention by stakeholders. As part of the review, the government appointed an independent panel of three eminent persons to develop commercial and, if required, regulatory solutions to improve supply chain reliability. During the review, the panel held broad consultations with 85 shippers, railways and other stakeholders, and received over 141 written submissions. In December 2010, the panel submitted its final report to the government. It recommended several measures to improve rail service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364612"> For example, the panel recommended the use of service agreements to define the commercial relationship between a shipper and a railway. It also recommended having a facilitator work with industry to develop a commercial dispute resolution process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364613">Our Conservative government agreed with the review's commercial approach and carefully reviewed the panel's recommendations. In March 2011, in a response to the panel, we announced a number of measures that we would undertake to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the rail-based supply chain. Our commitment goes beyond the panel's specific recommendations in order to benefit the entire rail-based supply chain. Let me quickly go over the government's response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364614">The first measure we implemented was a facilitation process to develop a template of what service agreements could look like in a commercial dispute resolution process between shippers and railway companies. On October 31, 2011, the government appointed an independent facilitator, Mr. Jim Dinning, to work with shippers and railways. In his final report to the minister, Mr. Dinning provided clear direction for both shippers and rail companies, moving forward. This included a template service agreement and a streamlined dispute resolution process for parties to use in their commercial negotiations. This government believes this process served its intended scope and purpose. We successfully brought shippers and railway companies to the table to jointly pursue practical solutions that reflect their needs and the reality of their day-to-day business together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364615">To support these commercial tools, our Conservative government committed to tabling this bill that would also give shippers a right to a service agreement with the railways, and provide a process to establish an agreement should commercial negotiations fail. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, the fair rail freight service act, would do just that. It would give shippers a right to service agreements with the railway companies, and would outline a low-cost, timely and efficient arbitration process to establish such agreements, if shippers and railway companies cannot agree commercially of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364616">This legislation would align well with what the review panel recommended in its final report. As shippers told the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities, this piece of legislation would serve as a strong backstop to commercial negotiations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="45">(2345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364617">First and foremost, the new provisions would create a strong incentive for the parties to negotiate service agreements commercially and to use legislation only as a backstop if commercial discussions fail. This reflects the panel's focus on commercial approaches to addressing service issues. If parties cannot negotiate an agreement commercially, the new provision outlines an arbitration process under the auspices of the Canadian Transportation Agency, which shippers would access to establish one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364618">The new provision prescribes service elements at a high level. Framing the provision broadly gives shippers the flexibility to ask for what is important to them, such as the number of cars needed for a shipment. This is in line with the approach suggested by the panel. It would also give the arbitrator the flexibility to tailor the service agreements to each case. If appropriate, the arbitrator could impose elements such as performance standards and communication protocols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364619">The new service arbitration process to establish an agreement would be fast, matching the 45-day process the panel proposed, although it could be extended by 20 days at the discretion of the arbitrator in some of the more complex cases. The arbitrator's decision on service would be final, binding, confidential and non-appealable. All told, this is a strong new provision that would improve rail service and make it more predictable and reliable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364620">Shippers echoed this sentiment during the hearings held at the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities and said that the new provision would enhance their leverage to negotiate commercially with railways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364621">To quote the testimony of the Canadian Propane Association on the bill at the standing committee, “...it contains all the mechanisms...we requested some years ago: a right to a level of service agreement, an arbitration process, and administrative monetary penalties”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364622">While introducing this legislation is a key component of our Conservative government's response to the rail freight service review, it is not the final piece. In collaboration with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Transport Canada is currently leading an in-depth analysis of the grain transportation supply chain to focus on issues that affect that sector and help identify potential solutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364623">Finally, we are also committed to establishing an industry round table covering commodity sectors in the near future. The commodity supply chain table would provide a forum for commodity exporters, railways and other members of the commodity supply chains to address issues that affect commodity freight systems. This would be an excellent venue for all players in commodity supply chains to work together to improve the reliability and competitiveness of Canada's export market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364624">As members can see, our Conservative government is well on its way to fulfilling its commitment to help ensure that Canada has the rail system it needs to support a strong economy and our domestic and international trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364625"> Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is a comprehensive package that supports the government's focus on economic growth, job creation and prosperity for Canadians. We are working to benefit the entire rail transportation system. As shippers and railways move forward in defining their bilateral relationships through service agreements, and as stakeholders come together under the commodity supply chain table, it will be important for parties to work collaboratively to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the entire rail-based supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364626">In closing, I strongly encourage all members of the House, from all sides, to vote in favour of this very important legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364627">Mr. Speaker, I live in a region and represent a place that relies heavily on our ability to move product to market. I am talking about a lot of small lumber towns, small cattle operations and farmers of various sorts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364628">What we have found over the years is that the smaller they are, the more mistreated they are by the large rail companies. I know that the view is shared across both sides of the House that small operators, whatever the industry, have tended to get short shrift as CN, in particular, and CP and others have become more interested in the big fish in the market and less interested in those small operators that actually built up the company from day one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364629">We had some improvements and amendments to make to the dispute resolution mechanism, based not on our own particular views but on the testimony we heard from those very same shippers. There are concerns that the arbitration method and the fines that are to be levied are not of enough consequence for the company to actually change its behaviour and its ways, particularly because these companies are so massive. I am talking about the rail companies that turn such extraordinary profits. There is not the motivation to actually correct the behaviour and change basic business practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364630">We only get to do this once every so often. It is not very frequent that the House is seized with changing and improving our rail system. While the NDP members are supporting this bill, our lament is that the government did not listen to any of the amendments that came forward. It did not listen to any of the advice that came forward from some of those very shippers it now claims to defend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364631">It is a curiosity to me that the government was so intransigent over evidence brought before the committee. Why go through the exercise if it is not willing to listen to the facts?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364639">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to stand tonight and speak to this bill. It was my privilege about seven years ago to go to my first meeting as a yet to be elected member of Parliament. There were a number of folks who were gathering in a community just outside of Peace River to discuss the issues of rail service in the local community. They had called me in because I was a nominated candidate and they believed it was important that I heard the concerns of the local community as we prepared to go into an election campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364640">Over the last eight years, I have been dedicated, in many ways, to ensuring that I bring the voice of Peace Country businesses and shippers to this House, our government, and to the shipping and rail companies, to address the concerns of my local constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364641">Today we stand on the precipice of having one of the largest and most comprehensive pieces of legislation to address many of the concerns we have heard about for the last number of years. However, it did not just arrive here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364642">My colleague just spoke about the extensive consultations that were undertaken across this country. I can assure members that is in fact the truth. I have the privilege of personally knowing the man our government named as the chair of the rail freight service review. The committee that he chaired was responsible for looking for solutions to the reality that our government recognized, and that this review committee also recognized very quickly, that being that small business owners, those people who are seeking to ship, really do have a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with large rail companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364643">Mr. Walter Paszkowski, the chair of the committee, served an invaluable role. He comes from Sexsmith, Alberta. It is a community that I have had the opportunity to call home. It is a farming community. It is an agricultural community. It also neighbours the city of Grande Prairie and is surrounded by the County of Grande Prairie. There are also a number of lumber producers in that community, as well as a growing oil and gas industry. That industry continues to depend on rail, and is growing in the necessity of being serviced by the rail industry as well. Therefore, we have three sectors that have become entirely dependent on rail service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364644">Having been a farmer and a former provincial agriculture minister, Walter knows the necessity of rail in the region of northern Alberta that I represent. He also has had the privilege over the last number of years to serve as the economic development officer for the County of Grande Prairie. It is a growing community. It is the community that I now call home. I can say that he has served our community well. We have been proud to lend him to the federal government, to all Canadians, to serve in this capacity. As Canadians, we can all be proud of the work that Walter has undertaken, both in this review and our local municipality, as well as his service in the provincial government before that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364645">With great disappointment, I would note that he announced just weeks ago that he is intending to move into what he is calling full-time retirement. I know that will mean he will do more work than ever because that is the kind of guy he is. I hope that Walter will take some time with his beautiful wife Marlyss to do some of the things they have never had the opportunity to enjoy because of Walter's dedication to public service. Marlyss has remained by his side throughout that process. Not only on behalf of Peace Country residents, but Canadians from coast to coast, I want to thank him and Marlyss for their service to Canada, to Peace Country, and to the province of Alberta. I know from the applause that my colleagues recognize that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364646">As Walter and the commission undertook their work, they recognized that there needed to be a new process put in place to ensure that shippers in our local communities, from coast to coast, had better and stronger clout in the process.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="00">(2400)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364647">Now we have before us legislation that articulates a process, by which, if commercial negotiations fail, there is an arbitration process to ensure that shippers' interests are defended. This is the first time we have seen legislation like this. This is legislation that we promised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364648">We know what happened. As the service review was being undertaken, all of a sudden we saw CP and CN begin to improve their rail service. It was kind of interesting. It was almost comical in some cases where, all of a sudden, the rail service was beginning to improve. We recognized at that point in time, as well as communities across the country, that service could improve and that there were mechanisms in place that the rail companies had at their disposal to ensure this happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364649">We have seen that it has not been applied consistently. Some communities are still falling behind in terms of service and some communities are moving ahead. Some industries are moving ahead in being served and some are falling behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364650">In my local community there has been an improvement in grain shipping over the last number of years. There has been some movement and infrastructure improvements on the lines. I note, though, that at times we still a struggle with cars being delivered on time, but I have also heard major concerns from the lumber mills in the communities of Grand Prairie and further north where there are still some major challenges in getting cars allocated in the time frame to which these companies have committed. These new mechanisms will go a long distance to ensure there is a balancing of the rights and responsibilities of both players. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364651">My bigger concern, as a representative of Peace country and the industries of agriculture, forestry and oil and gas, is about those people trying to get products to market. Our government has been dedicated over the last seven years that we have served in government of expanding trade with places around the world. One thing we know is that while we produce the best-quality agricultural, forestry and oil and gas products in the world, we continue to struggle to get these products to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364652">We can sign all kinds of trade deals all over the world, but unless we can get our products to market, we will not to get the prices we deserve or continue to grow trade relationships. This is vitally important. Our government has been committed to growing our economy across the country, but what that means in reality is that every community across the country has to see efficiencies when it comes to exporting the things we are seeking to export. We are an exporting nation. Significant portions of the things we produce in communities like mine go to markets outside of our country. We look to rail service to provide mechanisms to get our products from the communities that I represent in Grand Prairie and further north to markets. If they go to Vancouver, the port of Prince Rupert or Chicago, they need to move and they need to move on time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364653">Our government is focused on continuing to develop trade relationships to ensure that our products can get to market. We are also ensuring that there are mechanisms to ensure that rail companies will undertake their responsibilities and move products. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364669">The bill does in fact respond to some of the concerns of shippers, as has already been mentioned. The members of the NDP are still standing, they are still awake, and they are still ready to debate all the bills that have an impact on Canadians and the people in my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364670">The thing that is important to remember in this bill is that, in committee, shippers and businesses made six fair and reasonable proposals that would lead to something that was equitable. Unfortunately, the Conservatives flatly rejected those proposals, despite the fact that these were recommendations made by experts, by people who know the field and its problems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364674">Mr. Speaker, part of the reason my friend is going all night is that, once again, we have a government that has difficulty approaching the opposition to work collectively and co-operatively on legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364675">We heard testimony, and my friend knows this, that led to amendments on this piece of legislation. As for cases, we asked the Library of Parliament to look at how the Conservatives approach amendments from the opposition, and 99.3% of all amendments moved by the opposition on a variety of bills have been rejected by the government out of hand. The basis of the amendments in this particular case came from those very shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364676">New Democrats will not sacrifice the mediocre seeking out the perfect, and in this case, we have a bill that moves us further down the road. The challenge is that governments only look at something like our rail system every so often, sometimes only once in a generation. To do only half measures and not listen to the testimony of those people my friend quoted seems a disappointment, because the rest of the quotes say there were improvements that they sought but were unable to achieve in this round of negotiations. They were about the arbitration and about the fines that will be levied on these major rail shippers who will not really feel the pinch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364677">The reason there is time allocation on the bill is not because we did not support it. It is because the government decided to shut down debate for no purpose at all. That kind of obstinance does not lead to good legislation. It does not lead to good governance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364693">Mr. Speaker, that is right, my hometown killed an elephant. It was back in a day when rail was king. It was a day when everything moved on the rails and some things, I guess, had to move out of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364694">This bill would bring Canada and the rail system in Canada back to those days of service by our railways. They were days when goods and resources were moved by rail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364695">There is no question that rail transportation plays a central role in the success of our resource companies and our resources in this economy. In fact, Canada's natural resources industries are the largest users of rail freight services in the country, even to this day. Taken together, Canada's forest, mining and energy industries account for two thirds of all carload rail traffic in Canada. We know that the manufacturers and suppliers to these vital industries and many other vital industries, which provide everything from trucks to pipelines, also depend on railroads to transport their products and materials to market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364696">Our goal is to provide Canadian shippers and railways with a means of agreeing on service levels and ensuring a more effective supply chain. That is exactly what this proposed legislation will do. With this new legislation, we are highlighting the important role that railways play in supporting our economic prosperity. The goal of the legislation is to encourage railways and shippers to work together and it creates a strong incentive for them to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364697">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is designed to provide shippers with greater reliability and predictability in rail service. It is essential to the success of our natural resources industries. It recognizes the needs of shippers in doing their business and the needs of railways to manage their rail assets effectively. The relationship between railways and shippers is vital to Canada's economy as a whole. We know that when shippers can move more volume, it means more exports, revenue and jobs in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364698">Here is the bottom line. Improving rail service in Canada will help to unlock the potential of our great natural resources. As most Canadians realize, there is a great deal at stake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364699">Here are some statistics. In the mining industry last year, more than half a million carloads of coal, sulphur and fertilizer were transported by CP Rail. In 2012, CP Rail alone moved 67,000 carloads of forest products. Many of those in urban ridings may have only sat at a crossing and watched that economy move by them as they impatiently waited for the gate to go back up. However, in rural and resource Canada, that is money going by. In fact, it is about $20 million worth of goods a day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="15">(2415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364700">Additionally, Canadian Pacific recently indicated in its 2013 outlook that its crude oil by rail prospects continue to strengthen as the company expects to move to double the movement of crude oil to 140,000 carloads annually by 2015. That is from today's current volume of 70,000 carloads. That is a doubling of carloads of oil being moved by train.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364701">It would be a lot more efficient to move it by pipeline, I suppose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364702">Right now, natural resources are directly and indirectly driving almost 20% of the nation's economy and supporting over 10% of all the jobs in Canada. Natural resources are poised to play an even greater role in the future. Our opportunities for growth in Canada's resource sector, arising from the rapid economic ascent of some of the world's most populous countries, are unlike anything we have seen in our history. We have estimated that there are some 600 major resource projects currently under way in Canada or planned in the next 10 years, worth approximately $650 billion in investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364703">While global economic conditions may be a factor in investor decisions to move forward, the size and number of the projects is substantial. Whatever the short-term obstacles, the longer-term outlook is one of increased value and a demand for Canadian resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364704">We can point to tremendous opportunities that are happening right now across the country, from oil and gas in Alberta, to liquid natural gas in British Columbia, to offshore gas in Newfoundland and Labrador, to new discoveries of minerals and metals in the Ring of Fire in Ontario and in northern Quebec. These opportunities will continue for many years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364705">For generations, agriculture and natural resources have brought employment, growth and opportunity to every region of Canada. We must continue to harness this potential. Long-term growth and development in many of these sectors depend upon our railways and their ability to get the products to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364706">In a recent report, the International Energy Agency emphasized that global energy demand will continue to grow by more than one third by 2035, being led by emerging economies like China and India. These trends represent opportunities for Canada's energy exports in helping to meet growing global energy needs. Because one thing that we know for sure is that these growing economies will need resources, resources that are abundant here in Canada, such as minerals and metals, lumber, oil and gas. This trend underscores the urgent need for Canada to diversify our energy export markets, such as that of Asia-Pacific.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364707">Growing and emerging economies highlight the urgent need for Canada to develop infrastructure to export our resources to new markets and to ensure that our railways run smoothly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364708">Simply put, we know that developing an efficient transportation system is crucial to ensuring that our resource industries can compete globally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364709">The fair rail freight service act would provide the tools to build a strong and efficient rail network in Canada. This important legislation would support Canada's resource sectors as they continue to create jobs and prosperity right across this country. In these challenging economic times, it is good news for our natural resources sector and good news for all Canadians. With this new legislation, we would build on our country's legacy of railway and natural resources. We would be setting the stage for a brand new era of growth and prosperity in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364710">Just as we mentioned at the beginning, the country started with a growth in railways and a use of railways to transport those resources from coast to coast and to build this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364711">The resource industry today, in Canada, requires this act and railways to ensure that the resource industry can supply the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364712">Mr. Speaker, there are two points that my friend across the way and I can agree on. I am going to leave the tragic case of the circus elephant behind because I am not sure that this bill directly speaks to that particular provision. I do not see it in the legislation. There are two things that we can agree on. One is the importance of rail. Eighty per cent of all of our freight moves on rail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364713">The second is that we have a particular challenge posed to us in Canada in that we have two large rail companies that almost entirely dominate every sector of the market. In the U.S. and in other circumstances there are other options for those shipping products. Canada has a duopoly. These companies have been shown by the Competition Bureau at various times to collaborate and coordinate, to raise prices, to offer less service without retribution because they know they are the only options people can go to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364714"> We only get to address the rail system every once in a while. Does my colleague believe that any steps in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would do much to go after the service fees that have been talked about by many shippers in this country? They have had problems and real concerns that the pricing may be non-competitive. When there is a market with only two players in it, non-competitive pricing can pose a real problem to such a fundamental industry as the shipping industry in Canada.</ParaText>

This legislation would allow those shippers to have some negotiating power with those railways. </ParaText>

There are therefore constructive, positive elements, but there are also a number of elements that shippers and the official opposition were calling for but that were rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364732">Four NDP members proposed amendments, based on recommendations from shippers. Those members were the transport critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>; the deputy critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170320" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>; the member for <Affiliation DbId="170286" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170154" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364733">What were those amendments and recommendations? I will explain them. They were not that complicated, and they would have really helped shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364734">We recommended including details about the service agreements. It seems to me that service agreements should, at the very least, be signed and contain details. I do not understand why that was rejected. We asked that the term “operational” be deleted because it would limit the ability to negotiate and arbitrate service agreements. Again, that seems to go without saying. It does not make much sense to limit the measure we are trying to implement. We wanted to include a dispute resolution mechanism in service agreements for breach of contract. We also asked to limit the ability of railway companies to levy penalties and charges that are not in the service agreement.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="30">(2430)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364735">The rates are already exorbitant and the railway companies are abusing their power. Since there are only two main companies, there is a quasi-monopoly when it comes to shipping freight. The rates being charged to the shippers are too high. They prevent the entrepreneurs and the shippers from being competitive on the international market. We cannot even limit the capacity of the rail carriers to charge penalties that are not included in the service agreement. Nothing good will come of that either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364736">We proposed limiting arbitration when service agreement negotiations break off and issues are raised by the shipper. The last amendment sought to limit the capacity of rail carriers to raise network-related problems during arbitration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364737">All these amendments could have improved Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, but they were not considered. They were completely rejected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364738">Again, we are here to let the House know that people are not happy about this.The bill has other flaws. What about lost revenue. The Conservatives claim they want to strengthen the economy, but they are diminishing the capacity of the regions to prop up their regional economy, given that the affected sectors are the farming, forestry, mining, manufacturing and natural resources sectors. Most of these sectors are in remote regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364739">The Conservatives are contradicting themselves again. They would have us believe that their position and their bills are best, but then they sabotage everything they are trying to do by not taking the time to do proper research. They do not take the time to consult the experts in the areas affected by their bills. That is part of the incompetence that we are talking about here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364740">Shippers are currently paying the price of service disruptions, damage to their crops and service delays by railways. What is more, they have no other option. As many of my colleagues have said, 70% of surface goods are moved by rail in Canada, and 80% of these shippers are not satisfied with the service they received. That is serious. That means that service is considered to be poor in four out of five cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364741">That is why these types of agreements needed to be made after all these years. However, now that they are finally being made, they are more negative than positive. The money from the $100,000 penalties imposed on railway companies under this bill is not used to compensate shippers. Instead, it goes to the federal government. It really should be given to shippers who create jobs and who have to pay late fees and fees for services that the railways failed to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364742">This money is being sent to the wrong place. What is more, these penalties do not really act as a deterrent since we know that companies such as CN are making $2.7 billion in profit a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364743">In short, we are going to allow this bill to move forward, but it has many shortcomings. We must listen to experts on this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364800">Mr. Speaker, this is the first opportunity I have had this evening to specifically commend and thank opposition members for being present and continuing to push life back into Parliament and the parliamentary process. The government has grown, with a certain level of addiction, to the use of closure motions, shutting down and cutting off debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364801"> What is most remarkable is that before any effort has been made to negotiate the timing and order of legislation through Parliament, which has been the custom of parliaments, regardless of their construction over many years, another closure motion has been moved tonight on another bill on which the opposition agrees with the government. Yet here we are with a government that not only wants to cut off debate formally, but also thinks that heckling is a way to suppress comments on its legislative agenda, or lack thereof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364802">I would ask the government House leader to contain himself for a moment. I know it is late, I know he may be a bit jagged, but the fact is this is of his own making, that members are all gathered and sitting here at midnight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364803"><B>Hon. Peter Van Loan:</B> This is correct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364804"><B>Mr. Nathan Cullen:</B> He agrees this correct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364805"> The Conservatives decided that this is the best way to pass legislation. Not only do they want to cut off debate, but they want to extend sittings until midnight because they think this is a productive way to run a government. Canadians believe otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364806"> The government is so scandal plagued and interested in getting out of town that it has to push the clock and shut down debate. There is yet to be a commitment from the Conservatives to sit out the calendar of this parliamentary session. Based on the experience of the most recent question periods, it is no wonder the Conservative Party wants to skip town as quick as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364807"> Let us take a look at this legislation. My friends had every opportunity tonight to add their comments to the debate. I am not sure why they waited until the last three minutes of the evening to heckle me and my efforts to add something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364808">The government has purported two things in the legislation. One is that the bill is perfect. It must think it is perfect because it accepted no amendments. It did not change a thing because it felt that all the testimony, hearings, expert witnesses and shippers who came forward with recommendations and changes were all wrong. The only people who were right in the conversation was the Conservative Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364809">Lo and behold, in bill after bill, in legislation after legislation, when we hear from witnesses, gather the evidence and put it into amendments, there is only one thing that remains constant, and it is that the Conservative Party is always right on all matters. They applaud with a sense of arrogance and entitlement. I remember another party that felt that certain sense of arrogance and entitlement, that got a little drunk on its power and majority status and in slow measure the entitlement to those entitlements led it down a path that was entirely self-destructive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364810">I worry for my friends across the way. I lament the Reformers who first came to the House and said things like, “We'll never appoint anyone to the Senate, we'll respect the parliamentary process and we disagree when the Liberals invoke closure on bills because we do not think it is right”. Lo and behold, those same Conservatives cannot be found these days. The inconvenience of democratic institutions and debate have somehow got in the way of the Conservatives' laser-like focus on their own agenda to the chagrin and lament of many Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364811">Throughout the evening, the New Democrats have stood in their places and said that while they will not sacrifice the good for the perfect, this is an opportunity for the Conservatives to continue to learn that they are not the experts in all things, that they should once in a while put a little water in the wine and have a little humility to realize that when we go through the process of studying legislation, hearing from the actual experts who are going to be impacted and drive our economy, maybe they should listen once in a while and accept some of those recommendations and amendments. Once in a while a little humility would be a good thing. It looked good on some of my friends across the way to say that when governments achieved that sacred majority status, they were not given divine powers and they did not write legislation that was perfect in every comma and period.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="55">(2455)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364812">Some of my friends apparently disagree, but I would suggest that in order for our democracy to function and work well, the quality of the conversation must be based upon the ability of those in power to actually listen once in a while. They should listen to Canadians, respect our values and our views and our country would be made so much better for it. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364825">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise tonight to begin debate on the second reading of Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document>, the prohibiting cluster munitions act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364826">Canada has long recognized that explosive remnants of war, such as those caused by cluster munitions, are a serious humanitarian concern. They maim and kill innocent civilians around the world. They have a detrimental economic impact, and they hinder access to essential infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364827">Deployed from the air or ground, some types of cluster munitions can release dozens, or even hundreds, of smaller submunitions, which can cover a large area quickly. These munitions can have indiscriminate effects, particularly, when they fail to detonate as intended, often causing widespread harm to innocent civilians, especially in heavily populated areas. They can harm and kill innocent civilians, even long after the conflict has ended. Unfortunately, many of these victims are children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364828">Canada has long played a leading international role in the protection of civilians from the use of conventional weapons that are prone to indiscriminate effects because we have seen the devastating impacts of that use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364829"> Since 2006, our government has contributed to more than 250 projects in this global effort, making us one of the world's top contributors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364830">More recently, in February of this year, the <Affiliation DbId="165139" Type="4">Minister of State of Foreign Affairs, Americas and Consular Affairs</Affiliation>, while in Colombia, announced an additional $2.93 million over four years, to assist landmine survivors, including children and youth, with their recovery and reintegration into society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364831">I can assure all hon. members that we remain deeply committed to this cause and continue to evaluate possible landmine action projects that will deliver tangible results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364832">I would now like to address Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document>, which I believe would fully implement our legislative requirements under the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Canada was a key participant throughout the negotiations of the convention. We are proud to have been among its first 94 signatories in December 2008. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364833">From the beginning, Canada's goal was to strike a balance between a commitment to the elimination of cluster munitions and effective, legitimate and important security considerations. Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document> would do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364834">During negotiations, we committed to the eventual elimination of these weapons, but we also had to recognize the reality that not all countries were participating in the negotiations or were ready to commit to a convention. A compromise was needed to allow countries that wanted to renounce cluster munitions and ratify the convention to be able to engage in military co-operation and operations with countries that intended to retain these weapons for the time being. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364835">The compromise that was reached set out that these military activities would be permitted on the basis that the state parties would engage in diplomatic advocacy to urge non-state parties to reconsider. That compromise, found in article 21, was critical to allowing Canada and its allies to join the convention. Canada had a clear mandate in negotiations. We have always been open and transparent in exactly what we wanted to accomplish. It is important to note that this was not just the Canadian position but was shared by other countries. The provision of article 21 was necessary to bring others on board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364836">Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document>, when enacted, would prohibit the use, development, making, acquisition, possession, movement, import, and export of cluster munitions. It would also prohibit the stockpiling of cluster munitions in Canada, through the proposed offence of possession. This offence would cover any form of possession, including stockpiling, and would easily be enforced and, if necessary, prosecuted in Canada's criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364837">Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document> would also prohibit anyone from aiding or abetting another person in the commission of a prohibited activity. This would capture a number of potential cross-border scenarios where people or organizations subject to Canadian law engage in activities that are prohibited by the convention. It would also ensure that those who are subject to Canadian law could be prosecuted for the offences in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="25" Mn="05">(2505)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364838">For example, the convention does not require state bodies to criminalize investment. However, liability for aiding and abetting, as set out in the bill, would include investment scenarios in which there is sufficient intention and connection between the investment and the prohibited activity to meet Canadian charter and criminal law requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364839">We recognize that one of the most discussed aspects of the convention relates to article 29, which specifically allows state parties to engage in military co-operation and operations with states that are not party without breaching their obligations. As the convention allows this, the proposed legislation also contains exceptions that would allow Canada to engage in combined military operations and co-operation with states that are not party to the convention. Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document> would preserve Canada's ability to work alongside our allies, and it would provide Canadian Forces members and civilians with them assurances that they would not face criminal liability when doing their jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364840">For Canada, military co-operation and operations with other states that currently do not intend to ratify the convention, such as the United States, are of central importance to our security and defence policy. Again, it is vital that our men and women in uniform are not unjustly accused of criminal conduct and are in no way compromised in doing their jobs or what we ask of them in the interest of national security and defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364841">Even in the context of military co-operation, the convention reiterates that state parties shall not engage in specified activities that are fully within their control. Under Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document>, Canadian Armed Forces members would be prohibited from using cluster munitions in their operations. They would not be able to request their use if the choice of munitions was under exclusive Canadian control, even in the context of joint military operations. In addition, and going beyond what is required by the convention, as a matter of policy, the Canadian Forces would prohibit personnel on exchange, secondment or attachment with allied forces from themselves using cluster munitions and from training and instructing in the direct use of cluster munitions. The Canadian Forces would also prohibit, as a matter of policy, the transportation of any cluster munitions aboard Canadian assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364842">As the prohibiting cluster munitions act makes its way through the legislative process, our government has already taken concrete steps to fulfill its commitment under the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The Canadian Armed Forces has removed its remaining stockpiles of cluster munitions from active service and has already begun the process of destroying them. We are confident that the destruction will be completed within the timeframe required by the convention. It is important to note that Canada has never produced or used cluster munitions in its operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364843">We are already active in promoting the universalization and implementation of the convention with international partners, and we will continue doing so. As I have previously stated, our government is among the top international donors for addressing the impact of the explosive remnants of war, including cluster munitions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364844">Knowing the humanitarian devastation caused by the explosive remnants of war, Canada is fully committed to the goals of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and to implementing our requirements under the convention. We are proud to have tabled this legislation, and we are particularly proud of the important role played in Canada to get us here today. It is my hope that all parties will recognize the essential balance between legitimate security and humanitarian concerns and will fully support Bill <Document DbId="5515475" Type="3">S-10</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364845">I was just listening to the House leader talking about being very much concerned about our party, and comparing us to the Liberal Party on the other side. However, I want to say that he was in this House and the New Democrats were there as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="25" Mn="10">(2510)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3364846">Just because they have moved over here, it does not mean they have suddenly become more concerned about the running of this operation. Let me be very blunt and very clear. This government is committed to working for Canadians to ensure an economic environment, and that is the creation of jobs. Our budget implementation act is there to ensure that our country meets the obligations of ensuring that its citizens have jobs, the ability to educate their children and to have a life that is decent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364847">Under the New Democrats, if given to them, we would be in very big trouble, in a total economic disaster. It is for that reason they lost the election in British Columbia, because British Columbia was not willing to accept the NDP doctrine of stopping economic progress. They should learn from that instead of giving us lectures about how to run the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364848">This government is extremely focused on where we are headed. I want to thank the hon. member, but we will not take his advice.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3364850">Mr. Speaker, I rise early this morning on adjournment proceedings to pursue a question I raised in the House with the hon. <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, although I initially put the question for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, on March 6 of this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364851">This pertains to an issue that could not be more timely. That is why I accepted the opportunity to debate on the matter after 1 a.m. this morning rather than risk not being able to put the question for the hon. parliamentary secretary for a response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364852">The issue I raised March 6 was with respect to the treaty on conventional arms. It is the arms trade treaty. When I raised the issue, March 18 was still ahead of us and the United Nations was going to be debating this critical treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364853">As I stated in my question for the hon. minister, I was grateful for the fact that Canada was overall supportive of the treaty, but it did seem strange that we had decided not to support the important criterion that if corruption was at stake, it should be one of the measurements of whether an arms deal should be approved under the treaty. I also wanted to have the assurance of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that Canada was supporting all elements of the treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364854">This treaty did go to successful conclusion in negotiations at the special session of the United Nations that began on March 18. There was a great deal of celebration around the world for that and Canada did vote for the treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364855">However, the news reports that came out of New York, following the treaty's acceptance, suggested that Canada's support was somewhat lukewarm. There have been efforts to find out whether Canada plans to sign on as an early ratifier so we can be part of getting this treaty operationalized globally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364856">Spokesmen from the office of the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> have been somewhat equivocal about whether Canada will join on soon. I put that in contrast with Norway, New Zealand and Japan, countries that have said, yes, that they will sign on when the treaty is open for signature, which happens as early as this coming Monday, June 2. Therefore, we will see countries signing on and as soon as 50 countries have ratified, the arms trade treaty will take effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364857">Let me just review what this treaty would do. It would create common international standards for the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms ammunition, parts and components. It applies to tanks and all manner of munitions. It will help make the world safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364858">We have been troubled by the fact that the non-government organizations allowed on the Canadian delegation were limited to groups that supported the use of private long guns. That is perfectly appropriate within Canada. However, it is a mismatch when we are looking at a global treaty to protect nations around the world from the damage done by a conventional arms trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364859">Therefore, I look forward to words from the parliamentary secretary, my friend. I hope he will confirm that Canada has decided to be an early adapter, a country that will ratify along with Norway, New Zealand and Japan, at our earliest opportunity when the treaty opens for signature on June 3. It would be welcomed news for Canadians who yearn for us to return to our traditional role of leadership in peacekeeping and in making the world a safer place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364860">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for raising this question, even this late at night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364861">Canada already has some of the highest standards for the export of conventional arms. The items included in the ATT are already subject to export controls in Canada. Furthermore, Canada already applies the criteria set out in the ATT when considering arms export.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364862">Despite the high standards set by Canada, international trade in conventional arms remains poorly controlled in many parts of the world. Providing arms to insurgents, terrorists, transnational criminal groups and rogue regimes undermines international security and trade interests. It is for this reason that Canada participated in the negotiation of the Arms Trade Treaty that would help curtail illicit and irresponsible arms transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364863">Our Conservative government supports the rights of legitimate law-abiding gun owners and to that end, we eliminated the unfair burden of the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. It was and remains very important to Canada that an ATT not hinder legal and responsible international trade in conventional arms or create new burdens for Canadian industries or firearms owners. We played a key role in ensuring that the ATT acknowledges the lawful ownership of firearms by responsible private citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364864">The government supported the inclusion of anti-corruption language in the ATT. In fact, Canada already considers corrupt practices when looking at the risk of diversion associated with the proposed export. This is consistent with the government's anti-corruption efforts in domestic and international spheres, including our work within the G20 and the United Nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364865">Canada worked closely with our friends and allies in an attempt to negotiate an instrument that would help keep weapons out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and human rights abusers, while at the same time recognizing and protecting the ability of the law-abiding private firearms owners to enjoy the recreational use of their firearms in a responsible manner. The government is now consulting all interested stakeholders on the ATT in order to gain their insight and analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364866">The views of all interested parties in Canada will serve to better inform the government as we decide our next step.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364868">I do still have concerns. In part of his remarks, he seemed to, as others have done in his government, conflate the issue of the domestic use of firearms with this treaty. We need to underscore this so that no one is confused about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364869">This treaty has nothing to do with the domestic use of firearms and it has nothing to do with any kind of civilian ownership or domestic trade of firearms. It is specifically about ensuring effective regulation of international transfers of conventional weapons. As I said before, it applies to a range of military apparatus, including tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles and missile launchers, small arms and light weapons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364870">We hear the stories of child soldiers and we know that the forced conscription of children into war zones is an appalling and immoral act. If we can control the international trade in these munitions, guns and armaments, we can protect those children and we can reduce conventional conflict in hotspots around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364871">I urge the hon. <Affiliation DbId="170845" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and his government to ratify the treaty on June 3.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3364872">Mr. Speaker, I can understand the concern that the hon. member has expressed in reference to the international export of arms. We have one of the highest standards for exporting conventional arms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364873">However, when we are signing a convention internationally, it is important to ensure that it does not spill over into the domestic legislation that is currently in Canada. For that reason, we are in consultation with stakeholders. Canada has every intention to control the export of arms to rogue regimes, which she mentioned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3364874">The member can rest assured that we will be working with stakeholders, but our goal in the end is to sign this treaty while making sure that it does not spill over into the domestic laws of this country.</ParaText>
