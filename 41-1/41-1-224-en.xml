              <ParaText id="3244997">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, the response to the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Tse act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3244998">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is essential in maintaining the ability of police to protect Canadians from serious harm. It aims to ensure that the police retain their power to conduct wiretap without prior judicial authorization where it is needed immediately to prevent tragedy from occurring. The exceptional authority under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code allows police to proceed to intercept private communications without prior judicial authorization when an interception is urgently needed to respond to an imminent threat, such as kidnapping, a bomb or a hostage situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3244999">The Supreme Court of Canada held, in R. v. Tse, that the authority under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code was unconstitutional. However, the court suspended its declaration of invalidity until April 13, 2013, in order to allow Parliament to address the constitutional deficiencies of section 184.4. The amendments in the bill would respond to this decision, make 184.4 constitutionally compliant and add some additional limitations and accountability safeguards to use as exceptional authority for situations of imminent harm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245000">The authority to intercept private communications, under section 184, must be carefully tailored to balance the competing interests of the protection of privacy and the need to act quickly to protect persons and property from serious harm. The amendments to section 184.4 of the Criminal Code proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> would ensure needed accountability and transparency, while maintaining essential capability for police to respond swiftly in a critical situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245001">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> was studied by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and has been returned to the House without amendment. I would like to signal that the government greatly appreciates the assistance the House has provided in moving this essential bill forward as quickly as possible, while giving its important proposals due consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245002">To assist in its deliberations, the committee received written submissions from the Canadian Bar Association's national criminal justice section and heard from witnesses representing the Criminal Lawyers' Association and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association. I am happy to report that these witnesses expressed support for the main elements of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> and made very positive comments on the value and importance of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245003">I would like to take a few minutes to go over the major components of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. As indicated by the bill's title, and as I previously mentioned, the amendments proposed in the bill are needed to respond to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in R. v. Tse. In the decision, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the authority under section 184.4 was unconstitutional, due to the lack of an accountability safeguard such as an after-the-fact notification. Bill C-55 would remedy this constitutional deficiency by adding requirements to the Criminal Code for after-the-fact notification to persons whose private communications have been intercepted under section 184.4. The notice would need to be provided within 90 days, unless an extension was granted by a judge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245004">In the decision of R. v. Tse, the Supreme Court also suggested that the government might wish to consider adding a reporting requirement, although it was not needed for constitutional compliance. The government is implementing this suggestion in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which proposes to amend the Criminal Code to require detailed annual reporting by the federal minister of public safety and the Attorneys General of the provinces on the use of section 184.4. This requirement essentially mirrors the existing reporting requirement under section 195 of the Criminal Code, which has always been considered an important mechanism to increase transparency in the use of wiretaps. Such annual reports are intended to form the basis for a public evaluation of police use of section 184.4 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245005">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> also proposes to limit the availability of the authority to wiretap under section 184.4 to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code in place of the broader reference to “any unlawful act”. This limitation was not seen as necessary by the Supreme Court, although it was favoured by the lower court in the Tse decision. The amendment was also commented on favourably by the witnesses who appeared before the committee to discuss the bill. The proposed change to the term “offence” makes for a narrower category of unlawful acts and is consistent with other wiretap authorities in part VI of the Criminal Code, which are also limited to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245006">The Supreme Court of Canada also indicated in its decision in R. v. Tse that the government might wish to consider whether the broader category of peace officer under section 2 of the Criminal Code was too broad and whether to restrict the use of section 184.4 to a narrower group of individuals, such as police officers. The Supreme Court observed that this might be beneficial from a constitutional perspective, although it did not rule on this issue. The government agrees with the Supreme Court's suggestion. Accordingly, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> restricts the use of section 184.4 to police officers instead of peace officers. As the law presently stands, section 184.4 powers can be used by peace officers, which is a broader category of persons that includes officials such as mayors and reeves as well as fishery guardians and customs and excise officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245007">I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that the proposed definition of “police officer” already exists in the Criminal Code in the context of dealing with forfeiture of proceeds of crime. It also exists in other statutes. It has been judicially interpreted as only including those who are statutorily appointed to carry out duties of preservation and maintenance of the public peace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245008">Privately hired individuals, such as security guards in shopping malls or office buildings, do not fit within this definition, as they are not statutorily appointed. I should also mention that in looking at section 184.4 of the Criminal Code and the additional restrictions on its use proposed in this bill, it is important to remember that section 184.4 already provides a number of important limitations on its use. It can only be used where other powers are not available due to the urgency of the situation. The interception must be immediately necessary to prevent serious harm, and the communications that are to be intercepted must be those of the victim or the perpetrator. These restrictions, together with the amendments proposed in this bill, would ensure that the use of this exceptional authority is appropriately circumscribed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245009">The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has carefully reviewed the bill and supports it. The proposed safeguards and requirements in the bill not only meet but exceed the court's directives for constitutional compliance under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245010">I encourage all members to support Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245045">Mr. Speaker, with his question, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170324" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation> put his finger on the problem that resulted in the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. It is very clear; it is obvious. The government can indeed say that Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was withdrawn as a result of public pressure because that is true. I hope those who are watching us right now are happy realizing that it is possible to take action together when something is as absurd as Bill C-30. The problem was so obvious that it was extremely easy to raise a public reaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245046">I cannot repeat it enough: section 184.4, which the government is trying to save following the decision in R. v. Tse, appears in a part entitled “Invasion of Privacy”. This is an exception provided for in the Criminal Code for extremely specific cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245047">When the government, through the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, introduced Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, it launched an attack against anyone who would dare say anything against the bill. We were off to a very bad start. That behaviour triggered a popular movement such as we rarely see in matters concerning the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245048"> I said that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170324" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation> had put his finger on the problem. For several hours now, we have been debating that deficiency, which was reported by a government employee, a Department of Justice lawyer concerned about the orders he was receiving from his superiors and his department. When a compatibility analysis of government or Senate legislation is needed, public servants are asked to cut corners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245049"> This is an allegation. As a lawyer, I take note. Thus far, it is strictly an allegation, not a proven fact. However, it has to raise serious doubts. If we take our role as legislators seriously, this should immediately raise red flags.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245050"> Make no mistake about it: the problem with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was so obvious that the government decided to reverse course. We are not used to that with a government such as the Conservative government. The government is not very humble when it comes to admitting its mistakes. This is a major admission, and I believe a mea culpa is absolutely in order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245051"> However, this situation raises the question that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170324" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation> asked. Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> should never have passed the charter compatibility test. Is that clear enough? The government was bent on saying that that bill was the way to solve all surveillance-related problems, pedophilia-related problems and whatever other problems. It had cast a wide net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245052"> It did not take a brilliant legal mind to realize that there were serious problems of invasion of privacy. It did not take a brilliant legal mind to realize that the government had to be stopped and told that Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> would not pass a court test. It did not even solve the problem raised in R. v. Tse. It was very broad. Thank goodness the government reversed course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245053"> However, the question remains: how did this bill pass the compatibility test, which is mandatory? It is not the official opposition, the NDP, that says so, but rather the Department of Justice Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They provide that no legislation shall be introduced in the House where there are serious and reasonable doubts as to its constitutionality or compatibility with the charter. Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> is the most striking evidence that there is a problem somewhere in the Department of Justice in transmitting this analysis which has been conducted for the benefit of the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. I am giving him the benefit of the doubt.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245054"> I am not saying that his intention is to mislead the House. Telling us that this is the way things have been done since the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into force is not a compelling reason to say everything is fine. It is not fine at all, and no one seems very concerned about it. They just coast along, hoping that cases will not wind up in court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245055"> I moved a motion in the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to strike a committee that would analyze the question and assess the kind of directives that could be given so that legislators in the House could determine whether their role was being properly fulfilled. The question was discussed for two days, and I have to say that a Conservative colleague considered siding with us because he agreed that this was important. It does not matter whether we are left-leaning or not, everything must be done properly and we must take the time to examine the bill, failing which we may cast doubt on all bills introduced in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245056"> Every colleague who sits on a committee must question the minister on the kinds of studies that have been done to ensure compatibility with the charter and the Constitution of Canada. We have some doubts that this is being done properly. Even a Conservative nearly gave in. Probably two days elapsed before he was intercepted by the party's higher powers, who told him not to get involved. The official response was that it had been done like that since the time the Liberals were in power. To me, it is no excuse to say that we can do something wrong because someone else did it just as wrong. I believe there has to be a readjustment, and Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was a good example of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245057"> Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> has been introduced. I want this to be clear in people's minds: Bill C-55 is much more limited than Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, and it caused a shake-up when it comes to wiretapping and invasion of privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245058">Why did the official opposition go along with the minister and the government, who had to pass Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> at the eleventh hour? The decision in R. v. Tse is like Damocles' sword. The Court gave the government until April 13, 2013, to make the changes required by the ruling in R. v. Tse. As a result of the decision, section 184.4 had to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245059">Some people, like me, truly believe in human rights and the importance of privacy and rights that are protected by the charter. I also believe that we must have this kind of provision in a free and democratic society such as ours. At the time, section 184.4 stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245073">The Supreme Court of Canada also considered whether section 184.4 was meant for not only police officers, but also what are known as peace officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245074">Once again, I encourage people to read the definition of “peace officers”, which is several pages long.

              <ParaText id="3245075">The Supreme Court reserved judgment on this because it was not the subject of the argument or evidence before the court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245076">I am glad that the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> took this matter off the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>'s hands. That is one good thing because then he spent some time reading and trying to understand what the Supreme Court of Canada said on April 13, 2012, even though there was not much time left for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245077">As an aside, when the parliamentary secretary said that they had done a thorough job of ensuring their bill was constitutional, I had to laugh because, up until February 11, the government's response was Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. That left very little time to come up with Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. Maybe that is why the government did not want to take any chances. For once, they figured that they could not be too careful, so they limited the definition of “police officer” and even removed the notion of “peace officer”. They also added accountability mechanisms with respect to the people whose communications are intercepted and to reporting to the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245078">Is it perfect? No, as my Green Party colleague said. That is the conclusion we came to in committee. Much more could have been done. If I had been in charge of drafting this bill, I would probably have added a few things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245079">However, the House will have to answer this fundamental question. Would we rather get rid of section 184.4 and end up with no provision, or do we think that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> answers the questions and carries out the orders of the Supreme Court of Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245080">To us, the answer was very clear. Some witnesses even came to tell us that they supported the bill. The Canadian Bar Association, the CLA, the groups that sent us briefs: they all agreed. Would they have added some additional provisions regarding the reports? The Supreme Court of Canada never said that Parliament should receive reports regarding the attorney general of Canada or the provinces. However, we looked into it and examined this issue. It is not easy, because it is difficult to move forward if there is no discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245081">This bill was rushed. Normally, if things were done properly, we would have taken the year that the Supreme Court gave us to consult and see what could have been done better, to see whether the provinces were with us and whether they had a problem with sending us the reports that they will have to provide. All of this was clear to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245082">People in committee were clearly asked whether Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> in its current form was a suitable response to R. v. Tse.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245083"> The context in which the court only asked the person whose communications were intercepted to provide notice within a certain time, without specifying that time limit, fully meets the criteria established by the Supreme Court of Canada. Furthermore, time limits were specified and the concept of a peace officer dropped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245084"> For once, things were properly anticipated. This does not mean that there will not be any challenges. On the other hand, the witnesses we heard said that these kinds of provisions are not applied often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245085"> Yesterday, the Green Party member said that it would perhaps be necessary to withdraw the proposed amendment. I am relieved to hear this, because we were told the same thing in committee. A 24 hour time limit was suggested. It becomes difficult when you begin to examine these criteria. The danger is the tendency to treat situations that are not dealt with consistently in every part of the country the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245086"> Here in Gatineau, it is probably much easier to obtain the authorization of a judge than in a more remote part of Canada where a judge may not be present at all times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245087"> Clearly the provision is only applicable if it is impossible to obtain authorization within a reasonable time period. The basic rule in terms of interception of communications will still be to obtain authorization and to have reasonable grounds for the wiretap. Furthermore, the person doing the wiretapping will have to explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245088"> As a result of the amendments, there is now an obligation to inform the person under section 184.4. If a person, whether or not that person has been charged, feels that his or her privacy has been completely invaded, recourse is possible and the police agency in question will have to defend its decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245089"> However, even the experts tell us that this provision is not used frequently. The expert on the committee reported that there had not been any requirement of this kind for almost six years. Sometimes things need to be placed in perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245090"> While I do not want to lecture anyone, I am going to do so anyway. I seriously believe that the government should be aware of just how dangerous a game this is. The provisions of section 4.1 of the Department of Justice Act and section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which anticipate this exercise, are designed to prevent these situations as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245091"> All lawyers know very well, as I do, that it is sometimes difficult to tell a client that their case is a sure thing. However, if our priorities include decency, prudence and the public good, then we would be reasonably satisfied that this law met the criteria and principles of the charter and the Constitution. We would not raise a point that had only a 5% chance of meeting our constitutional obligations and tell people, as I was told in the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, that if they are not happy they can take legal action. It really bugs me when I hear things like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245092"> We are here to help the public and yet we tell them that if they are unhappy about our laws, they should take legal action and claim that there was an infringement of human rights.

              <ParaText id="3245093"> The government is grateful that we worked with it. However, we did not necessarily work with the government. We worked for Canadians, for the people and for the police forces that have to make use of section 184.4, an essential factor in the exercise of a police officer's duties in investigations.

              <ParaText id="3245099">Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> likely got away from them because the debate became personal and personal attacks were being made. The <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> personally attacked the people who opposed his bill, which was flawed. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> realized this and relieved the minister of his responsibility for the bill. Then the government had to scramble to solve the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245100">It is not always easy. I think that if the government did things right the first time, it would not spend so much time and money trying to talk people into something that is ill-conceived. In the end it does the right thing, but the process takes so much sweat and hard work, starting on our side.

              <ParaText id="3245124">My colleague and our public safety critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170322" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Louis</Affiliation>, outlined why this bill is necessary in his original remarks in the House. I will not go back and quote those reasons, but he certainly outlined very extensively why the bill was necessary and why we are now supporting Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> to overcome the problems that were actually created by the government itself in bringing in Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and by the remarks of the minister at the time, which the previous speaker talked about, which created such great controversy in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245125">I might mention as well that about two weeks ago the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> spoke at length on the fact that government bills are not reviewed by legal counsel to see if they meet the test of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He raised raised a point of privilege, in fact. What he was talking about, and I agree with him, was this regime's lack of testing legislation against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245126"> We have a Senate made up a majority of senators appointed by this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. More senators have been appointed by this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> than any prime minister in Canadian history. It has become as if the senators who are appointed are loyal to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and they are not doing their work as a sober second thought. The Senate is almost a rubber stamp to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245127">The next safeguard, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> said, is the courts in the country, not only the Supreme Court but other courts as well. Legislation passed in this place, which we as members assume has been tested by Department of Justice legal counsel and others to see if it meets the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in fact has not been. Then legislation is in fact tossed back, and that is in part why we are dealing with this particular bill today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245128">We know we have a problem with the way the government operates in introducing legislation without first having it tested by legislative counsel on how the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to it, and I know, Mr. Speaker, that in your role as speaker you will be coming forward with a decision on what the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> raised in his point of privilege on that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245129">I will get into the specifics of the bill in a moment. This bill, or rather the need for this bill, is symbolic of what is wrong with how this place is now functioning under the guidance of the current regime. I would call it the undermining of our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245130">There are several areas that I have to mention. First, as noted, the government brings forward legislation that we know now has not been tested, as it is supposed to be tested, in terms of how it applies to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Therefore, without that application, it is definitely going to make more unnecessary work for the courts further down the line.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245131">Second, in this place we see omnibus bills put forward with almost everything in them but the kitchen sink. As a result, parliamentarians are unable to take all the parts of a bill to the appropriate committee where members of Parliament who have taken on the responsibilities for specific issues—and I would not call them experts, but they are knowledgeable in those areas—can test that legislation. Instead, these omnibus bills coming forward cover so many areas that Parliament is not given the proper discourse, discussion and debate to find any problems, as we have seen is needed in this specific bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245132">Third, another aspect we have seen all the time with this regime in the undermining of democracy is the use of closure. The government only allows a bit of debate and prevents the representatives of the people from doing the proper analysis and research and coming forward with amended legislation. It has introduced more closure motions to limit debate in its short term as a majority government than any government in Canadian history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245133">Our critic for justice has put forward all kinds of amendments for justice bills, but because they are coming from an opposition party, the government ignores them. It does not accept amendments mainly put forward by opposition parties, even when the amendments make improvements to the bill. That is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245134">I see the parliamentary secretary for international trade shaking his head over there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245135">There is another undermining of democracy that does not necessarily show in the bill but that is clearly a problem around this place: at the committee level, when we move motions in committee, whatever they may be, the Conservative regime moves the committee in camera, in secret, so that Canadians cannot even see the simple debate on a motion as simple as asking the minister to come before a committee. What do the Conservatives have to hide? It is another aspect of the undermining of democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245136">The last point I want to make before I get to the specifics of the bill is with respect to the Senate. As I said a moment ago, the Senate has become a rubber stamp for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, because he has appointed most of the senators. I know that my senator is not even a resident of the province and region that he is supposed to be representing, which is a constitutional requirement. However, my key point with respect to the Senate is this: it is no longer the body of sober second thought; it is almost a rubber stamp to what the government does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245137">I make all those points on the undermining of democracy to point out that for bills such as Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, it is the undermining of democracy that allows a bill that does not meet the tests of the courts to be passed and become law in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245138">I will now go to the specifics of the bill. I would like to quote from a Library of Parliament report. As the House knows, the Library of Parliament does very good research. I want to quote from its report, because it is the best there is in terms of a summary.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245145">That is the background on what happened. The Government of Canada had previously passed legislation allowing those warrantless wiretaps, and the Supreme Court is basically saying that safeguards need to be put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245146">To summarize what the safeguards in the bill are and why we support it, the safeguards are basically these: the bill requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Attorney General of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4. That is a good step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245147">The bill provides that a person who has been the object of such interception must be notified of the interception within a specified period, and I will get into that in a moment as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245149">Finally, the bill limits those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245150">Therefore, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> adds three major safeguards to section 184.4 of the Criminal Code. It first restricts the use. It narrows the offences for which the wiretapping can be used, and they are spelled out in sections in the bill. Second, it names specifically the category of the people who can use those measures. Basically it narrows the category of people who can use it to police officers only. Previously it was debatable as to which people with authority could introduce wiretaps. It might be fisheries guardians or others who do not have formal training in the law or on the seriousness of wiretapping measures. The third point is that wiretapping measures could only be used to prevent an offence as listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>

We think, therefore, that the bill should be allowed to pass, because the minister, in his interpretation, is quite narrowly focused on what a police officer is. They are the only ones, in our understanding, who would have the ability to authorize the use of this power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245158">In the time I have left, it may be important, I think, to go back and review one of the key points, which is why the Supreme Court of Canada made the decision it did and to look at the safeguards put in place as a result of the Supreme Court decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245159">Clearly, the Supreme Court, in its original ruling, basically said that there was a serious lack of accountability in the use of the warrantless wiretaps. It recommended that notice be given to the subject of an interception and that the notice be provided after the fact. That is kind of standard procedure. It happens in other areas with wiretaps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245160">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, therefore, would require that either the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> or the relevant provincial Attorney General provide notice of the interception, in writing, within 90 days of the day the interception occurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245161">Extensions could be granted, but those would certainly be, in the case of ongoing interceptions, if it related to organized crime or to terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245162"> The other important point, and I will close on this point, is that reports from ministers at the provincial level or at the Attorney General level within the province, or from the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, ultimately—whoever is responsible—on the number of interceptions made under section 184.4, the number of notifications given and a general description of the methods of interception used for each of those interceptions must be tabled in the House and in others if it is their jurisdiction, outlining what those are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245164">Mr. Speaker, what is very interesting about the Supreme Court decision is that it says that the rule of law still applies in this country, even when dealing with criminal matters, despite the Conservative government's attitude sometimes. The Conservatives seem to believe that if they throw the word “criminal” out there, they can suspend all manner of civil liberties and due process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245165">In the act on the issue of warrantless wiretaps, the reasonable choice is that if police officers believe that a life is at stake or that a crime is being committed, they can obtain that data. However, they are accountable. Later on there has to be a written record of how it was used so that we know that this was not some personal vendetta or wild goose hunt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245166"> Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is very narrow in its definition. I think the Conservatives were forced to be narrow in their definition, because the Supreme Court held them to account. Compare that to Bill C-30, with which the government was looking to obtain all manner of information on Canadians on the Internet. The Conservatives would have allowed the minister, under section 34, to designate persons as inspectors who could go to a telecom operation, but they did not describe what those inspectors were. They could be police officers. They could be political staffers for all we knew. They were writing into the bill a wide variety of opportunities to throw as wide a net as possible to go after ordinary Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245167">The Supreme Court says that even in the case of dealing with criminal activity, the rule of law has to be in place. Whether on this bill or on deporting landed immigrants with crimes of six months without any due process, what does it say about a government that is that uninterested in the basic rule of law that has made Canada the democracy it is? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245168">Mr. Speaker, I would answer quite simply and expand on it a little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245169">I think what the member said is absolutely correct. If we break down to the simpliest terms some of the things happening on the law and order agenda of the Conservative government, I have to ask if it is really justice the Conservatives believe in or revenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245170">Looking at the mandatory minimum sentences the Conservatives are introducing, the laws have some implications. We hear about double- and triple-bunking in prisons now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245171">The way the Conservatives have handled some of these legal bills, there will be more court time taken up, because if a deal cannot be worked out between the defence and the prosecution, the defence will fight it all the way. As a result, some people will get off who should not, and some will have longer terms than they should have. It takes more court time. There is more cost to the system. Actually, at the end of the day, there is probably less justice. That is why I make the point that I think the Conservative government is more interested in revenge than in justice itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245172">On the specifics of the question, thank goodness for the Supreme Court. In my earlier remarks I outlined why, with some of the laws the government has passed, the courts are turning back to Parliament legislation that was improperly passed. That, again, is how the Conservative regime operates in a dictatorial fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245173">The member is right in terms of accountability. There are two points in the bill that come as a result of the Supreme Court decision and the changes in the bill. One is that notice of a wiretap has to be provided within 90 days of the day the interception occurred. Second, ministers and Attorneys General have to report to Parliament or to the various houses on the methods of interception used and the numbers used. That is a safeguard after the fact. It brings some accountability to warrantless wiretaps.</ParaText>

In fairness, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of laws that have been passed by this place that will be turned back for this or future parliaments to look at. The way the government rams these laws through is sure to create problems down the road, and we will likely see that in future years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245179">In this particular case, the court has ruled on a flaw in the law. This is just one example, but I believe that there will be many more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245180">I outlined in my remarks earlier that the government's agenda and the way this regime operates is to limit debate, limit discussion and limit analysis. That is being done in several ways. It is being done through, first, not testing legislation against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as we said earlier. That should have been done. We assumed that it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245181">The point of privilege of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> should tell us more when the Speaker rules. That is a grave concern, because we, as members of Parliament, believed that the Department of Justice did that as a natural course of practice, and it obviously has not been happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245182">Omnibus bills, which are bills that are all over the map, covering many subjects, probably never get to the committee with the expertise on them. Therefore, they are not debated or discussed properly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245186">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</Document>. I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170229" Type="2">Terrebonne—Blainville</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245187">Finally, we have a helpful, useful intervention by the government, a crime bill we can support, not one laced with poison pills. That owes to the circumstances under which the bill comes before the House. It is really the force of circumstances in the form of a Supreme Court imposed deadline operating here, serving in a sense to take the matter out of the government's control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245188"> It is the Supreme Court that has forced this amendment by way of its ruling in R. v. Tse, a case that dates back to April 2012. The case involved the issue of unauthorized wiretapping and, in response to the constitutional challenges raised, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that such a practice could be considered constitutional if the matter were authorized properly by way of legislation. Therefore, the Supreme Court gave the government some time to figure this out, a year in fact, and Bill C-55 is the response. It represents the government's effort to ensure such unauthorized interceptions of private communications be done constitutionally, and it succeeds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245189"> This bill would amend the Criminal Code to provide required clarity, oversight and accountability to the rules with respect to wiretapping in circumstances alleged to be too urgent for prior judicial authorization. Oversight and accountability do not come easily to the government, so it is encouraging to see the bill in Parliament. In fact, it is something just short of a miracle perhaps in light of the progenitor to this bill, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245190">The history of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is interesting and worthy of comment. Indeed, it explains why the bill is before us at the 11th hour, and indeed the last minute thereof, to boot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245191">The Supreme Court decision that we are discussing today was rendered a year ago, and yet here we are rushing this through before the April 13 deadline, which is looming. I will not be too critical of that because the timing of the bill is very much linked to the content of it and, frankly, what would make it succeed and be worthy of our support. It is the urgency of the circumstances that seem to have rendered the bill uncharacteristically brief and straightforward. It is in a twisted and counterintuitive way that we perhaps owe the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> some thanks for his tendency to a debating style that is reductionist in the extreme and that very often ends up posing distorted binary options. It is usually some framing of the issue that places sympathy for victims in opposition to a respect for civil liberties and constitutional freedoms. The case in point today was the minister's claim that people were either with the government or with the child pornographers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245192"> That was the framing for the now dead Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the so-called “lawful access bill”. I call it the case in point because Bill C-30 was really the government's first crack at responding to the Supreme Court's invitation to put in place a legislative framework that would render constitutional the unauthorized interception of private communications. However, it was both and alarming and cynical overreach that attempted to exploit all of our disgust and abhorrence for terrible crimes against children in an effort to bully Canadians into giving up their right to privacy in online communications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245193"> It was dubbed the “protecting children from Internet predators act”. That bill would have allowed law enforcement agencies to access Canadians' personal information without a warrant at virtually any time for virtually any reason. It would have given the minister and the government unprecedented powers to access information and to force telecom, Internet, telephone and wireless providers to allow the government to spy on customers. Bill C-30 would have effectively criminalized all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245194">That is the legislation the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> brought to Parliament a little over a year ago when he thought he had a bit of time to play games with the legislation. That is what the Conservative government thought was reasonable: unlimited and unaccountable access to private communication. Luckily, Canadians, Canadian privacy commissioners and civil society organizations were watching, and they did not like what was being proposed. Also lucky was the minister exceeded even himself with offensive hyperbole and sabotaged his own bill in the process. Yes, it is for that and that alone in a strange way that we owe the minister some thanks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245195">The lesson of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, of course, is not lost on anyone. It is that with time to play and left to its own devices, the government will gladly snatch from Canadians their right to privacy. Therefore, we can be sure that Canadians are watching and guarding that right very closely, as are we. Thankfully, this bill is a far cry from Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. It stands in contrast and, in fact, is short, simple, direct and straightforward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245196">The task to be accomplished by way of the bill is to amend the Criminal Code to comply with the Supreme Court's 2012 order to change section 184.4 of the code to comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or to lose it. Section 184.4, as it is currently written, allows peace officers to intercept private communications in emergency situations where the officer or officers have reasonable grounds to believe the situation is one of imminent harm to life or property. The urgency of such situations necessitates actions before the proper judicial authorization can be obtained. There are times when this is an appropriate action that can prevent crime and protect Canadians and for this reason section 184.4 exists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245197">Where it has fallen short up to now is in the area of accountability, largely. Two things have been missing: first, a system of oversight to inform Canadians of when and how this legislation is used; and, second, a requirement to notify individuals whose communications have been intercepted within a period of time defined within the bill. The court found in the R. v. Tse decision that this gap in the legislation constituted a violation of the charter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245198">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> would close this gap, perhaps not perfectly but through the use of four mechanisms. First, the bill would require that the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and provincial Attorneys General to make public a report on the use of section 184.4 to intercept private communications on an annual basis. Second, the bill would require that persons whose communications had been intercepted must be notified of the interception within a given period of time. Third, the bill would narrow the definition of who could conduct this surveillance and would change it from “peace officers” to “police officers”. Finally, the bill would specify the list of offences for which section 184.4 could be invoked to those offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245199">These four will result in an improvement to the section of the code that serves to both limit the use of warrantless wiretapping to certain individuals, circumstances and offences and to increase the accountability in cases where it is invoked. The Supreme Court of Canada has spoken on the issue and Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is Parliament's answer and, in the our view, the right one. Enhanced accountability and transparency is something the NDP will always support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245200">We know from experience where a lack of oversight and accountability takes us. We get massive omnibus bills, tax bills and omnibus crime bills passed at the last minute, with no time for parliamentarians to vet legislation, as our constituents rightly expect us to do. We get bills like Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which outraged the public, and the minister managed to shame himself in that process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245201"> Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> would revive at least a bit of what the government had run over and left for dead, which is accountability, by requiring the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> to report annually to Parliament on the use of section 184.4 and the frequency of warrantless wiretaps in emergency situations. It would also require provincial Attorneys General to make this information public as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245202">This is the kind of legislation we need, not the kind that gives cabinet ministers or other officials unprecedented powers but one that upholds Canadian law and increases accountability of police to the public. This why my colleagues and I in the NDP will support the bill.</ParaText>

Who knows, it could be a political staffer who would be able to go in to telecoms to demand ISP information.

              <ParaText id="3245214">I cannot speculate on why the government has such callous and obvious disregard for the privacy rights of Canadians. I cannot account for the zealotry of the minister himself and, perhaps as my colleague suggested, the PMO, nor the disregard for the charter, the Canadian Bill of Rights and the other legislation that, frankly, obligates the government to bring forward legislation to the House only after it has been vetted for conformity with the charter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245215">There is obviously a trend here. I reflect on past speeches I have given and all of these issues ultimately go to accountability. Bill <Document DbId="5683261" Type="3">C-42</Document> had the opportunity to provide the House with oversight of the RCMP, and the Conservatives ignored that. They go to Senate omnibus bills and so on and so forth. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3245216">Mr. Speaker, we know this government has very little respect for privacy. We have seen this in the speeches made by my colleagues here, and in the bills this government has introduced. We also see that it has little respect for the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed to Canadians. From time to time, it introduces bills that are at odds with the Constitution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245217">I am very happy that this time, it decided to comply with the provisions of the charter and amend the Criminal Code so that section 184.4 protects individuals’ privacy, as guaranteed by the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245218">We know that section 184.4 applies to the interception of private communications, and the Supreme Court recently ruled on this subject. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> adds measures that would require persons whose private communications have been intercepted to be so informed at least 90 days after the interception, and reports to be produced annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245219"> These measures are essential. The fact is that when you take away the need to obtain a warrant in order to intercept private communications in extreme situations where a life is in danger, it is important that there be oversight, with a system in place so that we know what happened and why someone found it so important to intercept those private communications without a warrant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245220"> The NDP understands how important it is for the police to have the tools to respond appropriately in dangerous situations, but at the same time, we cannot neglect the rights entrenched in the charter. Even in cases involving criminals, even in extreme cases, we have to respect the law as it stands. We have to respect the principles of Canadian law, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution. It is essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245221"> While I am happy that this government is finally respecting the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in adopting these measures, I should emphasize that this government, given the espionage agenda we saw with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and with Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, amended this bill to make it consistent with the charter only after being compelled to do so by a Supreme Court justice. So this was not something it decided to do on its own; it was an obligation flowing from the Supreme Court decision. If this government truly had the interests of Canadians at heart, it would have done this itself, instead of waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245222"> It should also be noted that this bill was introduced as the government was announcing the death of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which enabled designated persons, who were none too clearly defined, to gain access to personal information without a warrant and without judicial oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245223"> Once again, this government tried to go after personal information, and to treat all law-abiding Canadians as criminals, with no warrant or judicial oversight. If this government wanted to, it would have said that it is important, when looking for information without a warrant, to have a reporting mechanism or something of the kind, so that people are accountable, that personal information is sought only in extreme cases, and that law-abiding people are not treated as criminals, in contrast to what Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245224"> While Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, following the Supreme Court decision, ensures respect for section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms when private communications are intercepted, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> introduced measures that were inconsistent with the right we are guaranteed under section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to be protected against unreasonable search or seizure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245225"> There were two bills. The first was withdrawn, and I am very happy about that. Canadians are also very happy that the government decided not to continue with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. The second bill says that Bill C-30 was inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I hope the government will realize to what extent its own bill, its espionage agenda—I am going to call it that because this is not the first time we have seen attempts of this kind—seriously affected the protections Canadians are guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245226"> The people of Canada were opposed to the measures contained in Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. The government accused its opponents of siding with pedophiles. I was myself accused of being a friend to pedophiles because I opposed that bill, like millions of Canadians right across the country. It has nothing to do with being friends to pedophiles, and everything to do with believing in the protection of Charter rights and in the content of our Constitution. It is absolutely essential to protect the provision set out in section 8 of the charter. We cannot go against it, and the Supreme Court judgment demonstrates that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245227"> If Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> had been passed, it would have empowered designated persons, again not specified, and selected by the minister, to require Internet service providers to supply names, IP addresses and email addresses without a warrant and without judicial oversight. The Supreme Court decision demonstrates the necessity at all costs of protecting the privacy of Canadians, and shows that the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the charter are not negotiable, contrary to what this government thinks. I trust it has learned its lesson.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245228">I mentioned this already, and I would like to say it again. It seems that a little more reflection is needed on this. The government introduced Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which still has not been debated, but which also contains measures regarding surveillance without a warrant. Instead of explicitly saying that it would allow the collection of personal information without a warrant, this bill expands the definition of people who have access to that information and who can consult Internet service providers, based on a vague, sketchy definition. The Privacy Commissioner even raised some concerns about that clause, which was included in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245229">The mandate for online spying that the government has given itself is not finished. I hope the government has learned its lesson and that, in light of the Supreme Court decision regarding the proposal in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, it will drop any attempts to spy on Canadians online, when they are obeying the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245230">I want to emphasize that the government cannot cast such a wide net and treat all Canadians like criminals when they are online. Of course, there are criminals and people who disobey the law, and it is important that police officers have the tools they need to intervene. That said, the government cannot contravene the charter. It must respect all rights and liberties guaranteed in the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245231">Once again, I really hope the government has learned its lesson and that it will scrap its plan to spy on people online.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245234">Mr. Speaker, my colleague raises an excellent point. This ruling was made last summer, if I remember correctly. The government waited nearly a year before introducing this bill. Section 184.4 has been in the Criminal Code for years, but the government did not do anything until the Supreme Court said that the section violates the charter. The government is not doing this by choice; it has an obligation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245250">I am very pleased to speak again in the House on the NDP's views on this piece of legislation, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. It would amend the Criminal Code in response to the Supreme Court ruling referenced several times here this morning in previous speeches. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245251">The point that has to be reiterated is that this is all coming about with a very few days remaining to meet the deadline that was provided to the House by the Supreme Court. It stayed a decision for a year to give the government the opportunity to bring forward an improvement to legislation that is much needed. We have supported this legislation throughout the process, although we found the process daunting because of the delay that took place in getting it here. We supported the government because it is an important tool for our police services in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245252">However, on the counter side of that, it is very important for the official opposition to look cautiously at any legislation that authorizes people to look into people's lives in the manner that this would. This enactment seeks to amend Canada's Criminal Code, and the Supreme Court ruling talked about the need for safeguards for Canadians, because this allows for authorized, and I want to stress the word “authorized”, interception of private communications, done prior to judicial authorization as foreseen in section 184.4 of the act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245259"> I was speaking a few moments ago about the fact that we are within three weeks of a deadline supplied to us by the Supreme Court. There was the benefit of a year from the Supreme Court to act on this, and the government has not done so until the very last minute. I have to question what the delay is. Why did it take close to a year for the government to respond to this? This was not a great difficulty, from the standpoint that the Supreme Court identified the areas in which the government had to make changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245260">I would go so far as to say that when any government or any party in government looks to put forward legislation, a significant part of the process is debate in this place. Another significant part is the opportunity for all parties to come together, which we did in the instance of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> at committee, to look at it, to hear witness testimony, to do those things necessary to offer any piece of legislation the due diligence necessary to make it as good as we possibly could. That is the concern over the timeframe, the concern over the fact that we had a couple of days to try to do things that could have well extended beyond, had we brought in more witnesses. It is troubling because that impedes the due diligence we have to administer on behalf of those people who sent us to this place. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245262">There have been other times in this place that the opportunity to debate and to consider various bills has been impeded. I would ask how many times the Conservative government has moved time allocation on bills. It is not the delay just in this particular bill, but in other bills. We must be closing in on 30 times that it has occurred in this Parliament. It has to be close to that by now. I hear other members agreeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245263">We have seen budget bills and other legislation affecting services, which Canadians rely on, shut down or extremely limited by the Conservatives, at what appears to be almost every opportunity. It stifles the opportunity for us to make those bills better. It stifles the opportunity we have as members to point out what they have done well and what they have done not up to the standards Canadians expect. We get to do that in this public forum. That has been curtailed too many times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245264">Once again, that is part of my concern with this bill, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, and how it got to committee after such a delay. It has the potential of impacting ordinary Canadians in a very negative way if the protections of which the Supreme Court has spoken to us were not put into place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245265">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is simply an updated version of wiretapping provisions the Supreme Court previously deemed unconstitutional. That is quite a statement when we think about it. Fortunately again for the House, the Supreme Court set the parameters of what it saw as the need to protect Canadians' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245266">I have to say that Canadians have good reason to be concerned about privacy legislation that comes out of the government. To date the government has not had what I see as a good record in that area. It is not encouraging at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245267">There is an obligation on the official opposition to work for the public good in upholding the rule of law, our Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was in February 2012 that the Conservative government tabled Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. Members will recall that gave authorities the power to access personal information in a way to which the Supreme Court responded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245268"> It raised very serious concerns across the country, as I recall, about personal privacy and fundamental rights. That was due to the manner in which it was constructed and the powers it was seeking to give out. I will add that it was kind of a compilation of previous bills that have been before this House, Bill <Document DbId="4729969" Type="3">C-50</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5926081" Type="3">C-51</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="4740136" Type="3">C-52</Document> from a previous parliamentary session. The Conservatives were attempting to build on the original legislation from 1999 to provide public safety authorities with extensive surveillance powers over digital information. As I said a moment ago, there was a significant backlash from the people of Canada in regard to this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245269">Now we have the government with these much-needed changes, I will commend the government. It reached across to us in the committee. We did work better on that bill than we did on some others in the past. If we did not meet the deadline or the provisions required by the Supreme Court, then these emergency powers would be thrown out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245270">I began my remarks talking about the need for police officials of our country to apply these. In this particular case, these provisions are intended to happen at the worst possible time, when somebody is under physical threat of injury or harm. It was important for us to go a little deeper into it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245271"> I am looking for what really needs to be summarized here, and that is the fact that our role is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadians are balanced with the police officials' needs to investigate, particularly in a time where someone is under the threat of physical harm. I have to say that, working together, I believe we accomplished that. Thus, we will be supporting this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245273">I guess the comment and the question I have is that it is really shocking to me that the original bill, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was brought forward in the House, finally had to be withdrawn because of the massive opposition, both in the House from us, the NDP, and also out in the broader community. People across the country rallied against that bill. It was commonly known as “spying on the Internet”. It was a bill that was way over the top and, of course, we all recall the remarks from the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245274">To me, the bill that is before us today serves as a very good example of why an opposition, and Parliament itself, is so important. If we had not been here, that original bill would have been rammed through by the government. It did everything it could to try to put pressure to put the bill forward. However, because of the massive public reaction, the government had to finally stand down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245275">I wonder if the member would comment on that. To me, it serves as an example of what the role of this Parliament, and the opposition, is all about.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245276">Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the member that in this place, the duty of the official opposition is to call into question those times when a government, particularly one with a majority, is starting to proceed with a kind of cavalier attitude that it has the right to proceed in certain areas. Part of what we did, as the official opposition, was raise concerns and draw Canadians' attention to the issues. Once they came to understand the potential for the negative impact upon their lives, there was certainly the push-back to which she alluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245277">However, there is a positive side to this, too. When the government was forced to bring the legislation back in a new form, the opportunity to work together on it made that a better piece of legislation, more compliant with the Supreme Court's view of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245278">The sad part is that in this place we have the opportunity of doing that on a number of different bills, but in this particular government's case, it tends to just turn its back on the offer to try to make legislation better, better for Canadians, and that is who we are here to serve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245287"> First of all, I want to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation> and official opposition justice critic, as well as all of my colleagues, in particular the members for <Affiliation DbId="170410" Type="2">Brossard—La Prairie</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="170345" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation>, who have been working diligently to bring these matters forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245288"> I want to start by saying that we support this bill because we have the public good at heart. Respect for privacy, accountability, proper oversight, the rule of law and respect for the Constitution and the charter are extremely important to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245289"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="170345" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> noted that the government has moved time allocation close to 30 times. Time allocation is not used in committee, but causes that we espouse are systematically rejected along with many amendments that we bring forward. A climate of co-operation does not usually prevail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245290"> Things were different this time as far as co-operation goes. However, the government had a knife to its throat, so to speak, because of the looming April 13 deadline. In R. v. Tse, the Supreme Court directed the government to provide safeguards related to the authority to intercept communications. The Court declared that interceptions made under section 184.4 without a prior court authorization were unconstitutional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245291"> The bill requires the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and the attorney general of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4. It furthers provides that any person who has been the object of such an interception must be notified of the interception within a specified period. It narrows the class of individuals who can make such an interception and limits those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245292"> I would remind the House that this new Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is simply an updated version of wiretapping provisions that the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional. New privacy safeguards have been put in place. We believe the bill meets the standards in this area. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245293"> The Conservatives have a less-than-stellar record when it comes to privacy. That is why we took steps to ensure that this bill respected as much as possible the rule of law, the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245294"> This bill comes on the heels of the Conservatives’ abject failure with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. This piece of legislation failed to meet the charter test because it was not properly crafted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245295"> The Conservative government is making a desperate attempt to comply by the April 13, 2013 deadline with the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Tse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245296"> Section 184.4 of the Criminal Code provides for safeguards, notifications and reports. Firstly it would require that a person whose private communications have been intercepted in situations of imminent harm be notified within 90 days. Secondly, it would require that annual reports be produced on the use of wiretapping under section 184.4. These amendments would limit the authority of police officers to use these provisions and would limit interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245297"> The problem is that the current section 184.4 violates section 8 of the charter. Not enough thought went into it. It does not contain accountability measures to ensure proper oversight of police officers as they exercise the authority conferred upon them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245298"> The court therefore called for some accountability measures which were introduced in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. Among other things, this is the reason why we support this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245299"> I would now like to turn my attention to the prior notification requirement. The bill also requires that persons who are the object of interceptions be notified. Section 195 also makes it a requirement to report to Parliament, including producing reports on the use of interceptions under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245300"> For all of these reasons, we will be voting in favour of the bill because it attempts to strike a balance between personal freedoms and public safety considerations. However, the question is why it took the government so long to act. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is a step in the right direction, but why is the government not working together with the opposition at all times to resolve problems and improve proposed legislation? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245301"> Where justice is concerned, our priority is ensuring respect for the rule of law, for Canada’s Constitution and for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, not for any political agenda. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245302">Michael Spratt from the Criminal Lawyers' Association testified in committee in March 2011. He supported this bill. He felt that it was fair and constitutional and did an admirable job of incorporating the Supreme Court of Canada's comments from R. v. Tse. Mr. Spratt confirmed that the recurring theme is the balance between the protection of the public and the protection of privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245303">The Canadian Bar Association submission to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights also indicated that, overall, the CBA is in favour of the amendments the bill proposes to comply with the ruling in R. v. Tse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245304">A representative of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Raji Mangat, also said that this is a sensible and necessary privacy bill. She is pleased that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> limits the application of warrantless wiretapping to circumstances in which the goal is to prevent the commission of an offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245305">The notice requirement provides transparency and serves as an essential check on this extraordinary power to intercept communications without judicial authorization. This bill also includes reporting requirements in order to increase oversight in the use of warrantless wiretapping by police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245306">For all of these reasons, we agree with the committee witnesses that this remedies the problem. The government missed the mark with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, but has made the necessary changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245307">I am wondering about something and I will end on that note. Why does the government not work with our committee to improve other bills? The government should not just work with the opposition only when the Supreme Court puts a knife to its throat. The government must work with the opposition in the months and years to come. This would be a win-win situation for Canadians, as well as in terms of the rule of law and respect for the Canadian Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>

Finally we have a Conservative government that has backed down and admitted the error of its ways, a government that has been forced to go back to the drawing board. This is not the first time the Conservative government has been taken to task, but it should happen more often. Unfortunately, we have a government that delights in improvising most of the time. It is guided by its ideology and completely blinded by certain libertarian or conservative principles, so much so that its actions are not guided by the facts, by science or by reality, but rather by personal views, as the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister </Affiliation> pointed out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245364"> Members may recall that Quebec’s justice minister had asked the federal <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> some questions about a bill on minimum sentences for young offenders and in that instance, personal views had specifically come into play. In my opinion, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was also based on personal whims. It is a shame, really, because the privacy of our country’s citizens was threatened by the Conservative government, which adopted a very hostile attitude toward all those who dared call its bill into question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245365"> Members may recall that the Conservative minister accused the opposition parties of siding with pedophiles simply because they criticized and opposed Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. Highly ideological stances like this adversely affect debate in Parliament as well as in our democracy. </ParaText>

It came to our attention that no impact studies were conducted. All’s well that ends well, however, when it comes to Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> because the bill was scrapped. This proves that when there is public outcry, and when people mobilize, the government can be forced to backtrack, even the Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245367">Let me come back to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. It is fortunate that we still have courts in this country. It is fortunate that we have a Supreme Court of Canada to tell us which provisions need to be amended, because the Conservatives do not respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I said this in my previous remarks. I also know full well that the private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document>, which is a direct attack on unions and workers’ associations, also appears likely to end up in court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245368">It is good that the courts are reviewing these Conservative bills as they are probably unconstitutional, invade privacy and violate the right to organize.

              <ParaText id="3245369">We need to remember that the reason the bill is before us today is because a judge determined at trial that section 184.4—which is the section that is being amended—violated the right, guaranteed under section 8 of the charter, to be protected against frisking, searches, abusive seizure, and that it is not a reasonable limit under the first section.</ParaText>

I support all the groups and elected officials who are lobbying for this. It is important for improving the quality of life of the people of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245388">In fact, he is absolutely right. The government says it wants a minimal state, to intervene as little as possible and let people do what they want. However, what it is doing is drafting bills that run completely counter to Conservative discourse and values. The government wants to be persnickety and impose more red tape and bureaucracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245389">We saw this with Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document>, which also intrudes into the private lives of individuals. We saw it with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which gave the police forces a completely unlimited mandate so that they can go and see what people are doing, so that they can go into their computers and intrude into their private lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245390">We know that there needs to be a balance between security and protection of private life. That is why the NDP supports the bill.

              <ParaText id="3245395">We feel so strongly about principles like those contained in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that it is important to reiterate our belief in these values. It is unfortunate that it took a court order before our government was willing to ensure compliance with section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Being willing to ensure that these principles and values are respected and never circumvented should have been a no-brainer. Unfortunately, there are already many examples of the Conservative government failing to understand their importance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245396">I would also like to thank the member for his comment about our belief in safety for people in general. I would like to comment again on the issue of pedestrian railway crossings. People sometimes have to make holes in the wire mesh to get through. This is certainly unsafe. There is a risk that they could be hit and they could also be fined if they are caught.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245397"> Montreal has been sliced in two. There is no flow.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3245398">Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to address Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. It is important right from the beginning to mention why we are debating the bill today. On April 13, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada sent a very strong message to the House of Commons, in particular to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that section 184.4 needed to be amended. It made a sunset by saying that the Government of Canada would have one year to pass the necessary legislation to validate the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245399">What is section 184.4? It talks about a police officer's ability to intercept a private conversation in some fashion without having to get a warrant. That is what this is all about. The government has been aware of it for a number of years. The Supreme Court of Canada having made its decision on April 13, 2012, and having put a time limit on it has now forced the government to act on it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245400">I will talk about the lack of the timely fashion in which the government has made the decision to bring in the bill. However, prior to doing that, I would like to reflect on what I believe is very important to all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245401"> All Canadians believe in private rights and want to ensure their rights are protected. At times we might get a little spooked. We see cameras popping up all over the place, whether it is photo radar cameras, speed cameras, cameras at high density intersections, or even nowadays on sidewalks or public buildings and public areas where people gather. Every so often I hear from constituents who want to talk about private rights. It is important for us to recognize that as individuals we do have private rights that need to be protected at all times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245402">I was a very strong advocate for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for many years. This year we celebrated 30 years of having the charter, which has stood the test of time. A vast majority, 90%-plus of Canadians, have grown to respect and believe in the charter as something that protects them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245403">I remember when my girlfriend, now my wife, and I watched the signing ceremony between Pierre Trudeau and the Queen in 1982. It was a special moment and it was something my girlfriend appreciated. It was important to me and I believe it was important to her. It is because we recognized how important it was that individuals had rights. That is why Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is very important legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245404">I have had the opportunity to speak about it at second reading. Unfortunately, I was unable to be at committee, but I did to get to speak very briefly yesterday because we were limited to 10 minutes to the amendments brought forward. However, it is important legislation that needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245405"> If we look at it from a historical point of view, whether it was Pierre Elliott Trudeau, or Jean Chrétien or one of Canada's best Attorneys General, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170211" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation>, it speaks so well on individual rights and the need to protect them. Quite often when individuals of that calibre stand and talk about individual rights, we need to listen because it is a very important aspect of being Canadian.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245406">We turn on the news and we watch throughout the world where individual rights are virtually walked all over. There is a general lack of respect for individual rights throughout the world. I believe Canada has a leadership role in demonstrating to the world that we value the Charter of Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245407"> A number of years ago I had the privilege and the opportunity to travel to Israel. When I met with one of the politicians there, he made reference to Canada's Charter of Rights and how he thought it was an important thing that Canada did in 1982. What we are doing here has an impact that goes beyond our own borders. That is why there is an onus and a responsibility for us to be very careful in behaving and acting on important legislation in a more timely manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245408">Before going into some of the details of the bill, I will talk about why we have the bill. I made mention of the Supreme Court of Canada and also that the government knew about it well before that. The Supreme Court of Canada has in essence said to the government that it really has messed up. It did not have to go to the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245409"> The Conservatives had an opportunity to deal with the issue previously. Many parliamentarians here today will recall Bill <Document DbId="4729969" Type="3">C-50</Document>. I was not here at that time. That bill was an attempt to deal with what the Supreme Court of Canada was forced to deal with, but because the Conservatives prorogued the session, in essence killing all legislation before the House, that attempt was defeated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245410">That was not the first or second time. The most recent time would have been Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> from last year. That bill came with a great deal of fanfare. A lot of allegations were made and the overwhelming reaction was quite significant, to the degree that we saw the Government of Canada push the hold button, and that bill has never seen the light of day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245411"> The bill was introduced almost a year ago, and it would have dealt with this issue, at least in part. It also would have dealt with other things, which raised the ire of hundreds of thousands of Canadians and opposition parties, definitely the Liberal Party of Canada. However, we saw the Conservatives failing to address what was a very important issue, and I will comment on that issue very shortly. Instead of doing the right thing, which would have been recognizing that Bill C-30 was going nowhere back in June, the Conservatives could have introduced this bill last fall, in September or October, and reviewed some of the other legislation that we were talking about then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245412"> There were opportunities for the government members to deal with this legislation. It is not like there is overwhelming opposition to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. In fact, the members of the Liberal Party have been very clear that we support the passage of the bill. We have done nothing to slow down its passage. We recognize that the bill has to be passed through Parliament by April 12 or 13 of this year. We have committed to working to do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245413">However, we also believe the legislation needs to go through due diligence and through the process in a timely fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245414">What does that mean? It means the government and, in particular, the government House leader. This is another wake-up call for him. He needs to get his legislative agenda in order. He needs to perhaps meet with the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and some of his other ministers and get a sense in what kind of legislation is coming down the pike into the House of Commons. If he did his homework, then at the very least the legislation we have today could have been, and should have been, introduced back in October last year, give or take a month. Had the Conservatives done that, there would not be this sense of urgency we have today to pass the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245415">That decision, many of my caucus colleagues would say, was intentional. The government continued to hold back on introducing this legislation. I cannot blame them for thinking that. All we have to do is take a look at all the legislation that has been brought forward and the record number of time allocations on a wide variety of legislation. Remember those huge budget bills containing dozens of pieces of legislation amended through the backdoor of a budget. We can understand why members of the Liberal Party are a little skeptical in how the government chooses to bring in legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245416">The timing is a very important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245417">We have Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> today. It is expected the bill will pass. As I say, it does have the support of the Liberal Party and we will assist the government allowing the bill, ultimately, to pass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245418">However, we ask the government to take responsibility when it brings forward legislation, to take into consideration that the House of Commons has a very important role to play. When it brings a bill in for second reading, members of Parliament of all political stripes are should be afforded the opportunity to provide their contributions, whatever they might be. Even if it is a sense of repetition speaker after speaker, it has to provide for that and then allow for it to go to committee in a timely fashion where we can bring in different stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245419">I would like to think that under Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, in a normal process, there might have been a higher level of interest from the different stakeholders from coast to coast to coast with respect to what type of legislation they wanted to see. That would have been very productive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245420">There was an attempt. It could be very discouraging to move amendments inside the House since there has been a Conservative majority, a different type of Conservative Reform Party going back to the old Reform roots, possibly. However, there has been a different attitude. Even I have detected that. It can be a challenge to move amendments inside the House. I have seen amendments stonewalled. I remember when the member for <Affiliation DbId="170211" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> attempted to move amendments in committee and, ultimately, at third reading and the government turned them down. It took the Senate in order to pass it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245421">If Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> were provided the opportunity that it should have been in allowing for not only that fulsome debate within the chamber but equally an opportunity to have stakeholders from across Canada contribute to the debate, I believe we would have had more of a contribution at that point in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245422">It is important to allow for that. We are talking about are private communications that can be interrupted or listened to by the police without any warrant. That is very serious. I think many Canadians could have made presentations if it was felt that we had the time to listen thoroughly to our stakeholders or even affording opposition parties or individual members to consult on the legislation in advance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245423">From committee, we come now to third reading. The bill has been here for a couple of days. We in the Liberal Party want to see the bill pass. I suspect that the New Democrats will support us. However, the timing is a huge concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245424">The bill requires appropriate ministers in Canada to report whenever they have an intercept. That means that a minister of justice in a province, such as Manitoba, Ontario, or wherever it might be in Canada, would be notified when an interception occurred in their jurisdiction. Those provincial entities would then be obligated to report to the House of Commons, through the Minister of Public Safety, and ideally, to have it tabled it in some form in the House. It is a very important measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245425">We would like to think that the frequency of any police agency having to use clause 184.4 without a warrant would be very low. There is nothing wrong with trying to find and accumulate information that allows us to make valued opinions regarding its usage. We should be reviewing that, because we are talking about individual rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245426">Where a person's rights have been overlooked because it is believed that it is in the public interest, that individual has the right to know that a wiretap was done without a warrant. We are not saying that we should give a person a call to say that the telephone is going to be tapped. Once it has been done, there is an obligation to let that individual know that it has taken place. From what I understand, that is being done within this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245427">The bill would provide more accountability and oversight. It would narrow the number of individuals or offices that could actually use clause 184.4. Today, one could be a mayor of a municipality and have the authority to listen to a private conversation without a warrant. The legislation is saying that this is too wide. We need to narrow the number of individuals who can do that. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> narrows it down to police officers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245428">It also limits the types of interceptions. It should be used very rarely. For example, in a situation where someone's life is at risk or a child has been kidnapped, we need to ensure that police officers have the ability to save that life or ensure that a child is not molested. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> moves in that direction.</ParaText>

He talked about the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but what he did not talk about was a very important change that occurred between the Bill of Rights and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was property rights. It was eliminated by the Liberal Party. Now we see it extended to the point where, in the province of Ontario, for example, residents who are fighting fiercely to prevent wind turbines from being built on their doorsteps are finding that they have no property rights on which to stand. That is because the Liberal Party eliminated them. I wonder if the member would support reinserting property rights into the charter. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245463">I am going to speak today on why the New Democratic Party is supporting Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> and what works about this bill, but also on the issues we need to look at and the prism that needs to be applied in terms of how the legislation was crafted, what it was in response to and how it ties into two other key pieces of legislation that this House has been asked to deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245464"> One is Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and the other is Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>. Within each of the bills are key issues that reflect on the ability of the government to move forward with legislation and on how legislation is actually brought forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245465">What is striking already, off the top of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, is that it is a very narrow bill. It is simply addressing a section of the Criminal Code, section 184.4, that the Supreme Court struck down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245466">What we find is that legislation that is limited is usually more effective than legislation that is broad. Legislation is a very a blunt tool. Unfortunately, we have seen that the government likes to throw in all manner of legislation, often without thinking of the consequences or with very little regard for the consequences. We have seen one omnibus bill after another brought before the House without proper review and without a proper understanding of how they related to basic issues like charter rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245467">I would like to say that I think the government is doing the right thing with Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> by having very narrowly defined legislation that addresses a major problem. I would like to think that the government thought this approach up on its own and that this is how it is going to start dealing with criminal matters and the reform of the criminal justice system, but that is not really what has happened here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245468">The government is responding to the fact that the Supreme Court struck down section 184.4 of the Criminal Code and gave it a deadline of April 13, which is only two weeks away, to address the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245469">I am going to speak a little about Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> and then explain how the implications of the Supreme Court legislation tie in to Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245470">Under section 184.4, the Supreme Court ruled in R. v. Tse that police use of a warrantless wiretap to secure the safety of an individual is a correct step to take. If a life is at stake, law officers have the ability within Canadian jurisprudence to go in, get the evidence and secure a life. That is a long-standing practice within the Canadian law system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245471">However, the problem with section 184.4 is that there are no accountability mechanisms. What I find very interesting about the Supreme Court decision is that it says that even in the case of criminal activities—and what we were dealing with in this case was a kidnapping, a very horrendous attack against a citizen—basic charter rights still remain and have to be balanced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245472">The Supreme Court took the larger view and recognized that the spectre of criminality cannot be used to undermine the basic rights of citizens in this country. This is a concept that seems absolutely foreign to the Conservative Party, whose backbenchers jump up whistling and dancing every time they can come up with some extreme case of a criminal activity as a cover to allow them to undermine all manner of privacy rights, all manner of basic citizen rights. They have done it time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245473">The Supreme Court has said no. The test of law in this country is what is reasonable versus unreasonable. What is reasonable is that if law officers know someone is at risk and need to get that information immediately, it is reasonable to go for the warrantless wiretap to gather that information without the judge's warrant, which can then be obtained later. What is unreasonable is to do that without any oversight mechanism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245474">Section 184.4 will clarify this, because it defines—and this is a very important thing again in dealing with Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>—who is eligible, the police; how it is to be used, under specific circumstances; and why it is to be used, to protect the rights of citizens balanced against the right to bring safety to people who are perhaps under threat of criminal activity. The definition of how this breach of law would be allowed is crucial to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245475">When we look at Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was the bill that this was supposed to be a part of, we see that none of these definitions of the who, the how and the why are there. In fact, it is so broad that the privacy commissioners from across Canada, in an unprecedented response to the government, wrote against the government's attempt to undermine the basic civil rights of Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245476">Whenever the Conservative government attempts to do something that it knows will not pass a charter challenge or attempts to pull something that it knows the Canadian public will not stand for, it uses a bogeyman. The minister used perhaps the most baseless attack that has ever been uttered in the House of Commons when he said that anybody who was concerned about privacy rights or the individual rights of citizens in this country or who dared raise a question to him was on the side of child pornographers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245477">That was about as ugly as it can get. Of course, now we see who is on the side of child pornographers: Mr. Tom Flanagan, who said that it is a victimless crime. We see the right-wing media is concerned about Mr. Tom Flanagan, a very famous and very rich right-wing white man. It was his rights, we are now being told, that were somehow trampled upon. One reporter said that he thought it showed the fundamental shallowness of Canadians that they were outraged that Mr. Flanagan was defending the rights of child pornographers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245478">However, that was the kind of language being used by this minister to cover up the fact that there were major flaws in Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. If we tie it back to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> in terms of the Supreme Court, the government must have known that none of its provisions would have passed the charter challenge because they did not meet the basic standards of jurisprudence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245479">Let us look at the lack of the who, the how and the why in terms of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> as compared to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> may be brought back by the government; we are not yet sure. Under clause 33, the government would be allowed to designate an inspector to go into a telecom to demand information for being in compliance with Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245480">The minister may designate inspectors, that is his choice, but there is no definition of what those inspectors are. Are they police? Are they private security? Are they political staffers? We do not know. Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> would allow the extraordinary ability of the minister to appoint inspectors. Under clause 34, these inspectors would be allowed to go into public telecoms to gather information on private citizens. That is clearly something that would never pass the charter challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245481">In contrast, in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> we see that they have defined the right to ask for warrantless information to just the police, which is the proper place it should be. We should know who is able to gather that information on us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245482">What they wanted to do under Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was allow warrantless access to subscriber information on the data use of anybody with a cellphone or an ISP address, which would pretty much mean 95% or 96% of the Canadian public. Unspecified persons could gather that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245483">The privacy commissioners of Canada spoke out against this. They said that contrary to the Conservative Party's claims, it had nothing to do with being just like a phone book. Ann Cavoukian said that this was “one of the most invasive threats to our privacy and freedom that I have ever encountered”. About being able to demand and being forced to turn over this information, she said: </ParaText>

Under Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, they also wanted to force telecoms to basically build in back-channel spy communication, so that as they expanded their networks, they would have to build in the monitoring system to keep track of any citizen the government felt it should be able to look at at any time, again without any oversight and without citizens knowing they would be spied upon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245487">Ann Cavoukian, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, said that what they were in fact doing, although they perhaps did not realize it, was creating a hacker's paradise. If we allow wormholes throughout the telecom system to allow police to spy on it, then certainly the hackers, who are usually about three steps ahead of everybody else on this—and we see massive international gangs using sophisticated cyberhacking—would be able to benefit much more than the police or security services.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245488">In terms of the how, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> limits the ability to get a warrantless wiretap based on the possibility of a threat to a person. Afterwards there would have to be oversight mechanisms and reports would have to be published and reported to Parliament so that we would know how these warrantless wiretaps are being used. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> defines and protects this breach of the private rights of citizens, whereas under Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the door was kicked down and all the basic rights of citizens were thrown out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245489">Of course we know that Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was responded to in a massive and very exciting and positive response from the public, a backlash that said that we demand that our privacy rights be protected and defined under the rule of law in this country. It was an unprecedented backlash against the government. The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has been pretty much hiding under his desk publicly ever since. It is a good sign that we have a engaged citizenry here that knows the difference between what is reasonable and unreasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245490"> In Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, the government is limited to gathering information under the reasonableness of protecting an individual who is facing threat compared to the unreasonableness of doing away with all manner of privacy rights whatsoever. In this manner, I would say that the Canadian public are foremost across the world in standing up for their rights, much more than the government, which has very little respect for the privacy rights of Canadians. In other democracies with privacy rights in the digital age and the age of big data and CCTV cameras, other citizens are steadily having those rights eroded, whereas in Canada we want to maintain those rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245491">In Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which is the other piece of legislation to compare Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> to, again we see the government showing no respect for the privacy rights of Canadians. There is no understanding of the importance of privacy rights. We certainly saw that with the massive data losses of private financial information on over 500,000 Canadians at HRSDC. We have seen other data breaches. We saw the government's cavalier attitude when, rather than warning citizens that their personal financial data may have been breached, its only desire was to protect the minister, and it kept the breach quiet for two months. Any manner of international gangs could have had that data, gone after people's credit and created massive widespread fraud, because that is what can happen if the public is not alerted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245492">Under Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the government wants to change the reporting threshold for private business when these privacy breaches happen. This is very important in terms of defining how we protect the rights of citizens. Under the changes the government is bringing in Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, private companies that have our data, whether a bank, a Sony PlayStation, or all manner of online transactions, would only have to report the breach to the Privacy Commissioner if they thought there was a significant risk of harm. “Significant” is an extremely high bar to set. Meanwhile, all manner of abuse could happen underneath it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245493">Also, private businesses would be very wary about the idea of going public with the fact that they may have lost Visa card information or personal data information for 100,000 or 200,000 or 500,000 people, because it affects their basic online business model. Everything is now done online. However, we see the government telling private businesses that they only have to report a privacy breach if it might cause significant harm. That completely fails the basic test and the understanding of the importance of privacy rights in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245494">We believe that there has to be a very clear rule that if companies fear they have been hacked and that privacy data has been breached, it has to be reported to the Privacy Commissioner, who has such an extraordinary role to play in protecting and reviewing the evidence and deciding whether action must be taken. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245495">However, we see that again the government is undermining the role of the Privacy Commissioner and we have to ask why. As more and more Canadians operate their businesses online and as our financial transactions occur online, the last thing we want to do is create a hackers' paradise in Canada, while the rest of the world moves further ahead of us. Ann Cavoukian has spoken about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245496">It is extraordinary that Canada was once seen as the world leader in privacy data. Our Privacy Commissioner is definitely seen as a world leader, but our legislation is falling further and further behind where the Europeans and the Americans are going. As our Privacy Commissioner is asking for the tools to update, to deal with the cyberthreats and to deal with the protection of personal information in the age of big data, the current government is undermining the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245497">How does that relate to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>? There are direct connections in the language among Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and what we have seen in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. Bill C-12 would allow organizations and companies, including telecommunications companies, to disclose personal information to government institutions, perhaps the police or perhaps not, without the knowledge and consent of the individual when performing policing services. This is under subclause 6(6), but there is no definition of what “policing services” are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245498">Again, it is the language of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the lawful access and online snooping language, that would allow some undefined security person or force to obtain information on private individuals from telecommunications without defining who would be eligible to gather that information, whereas Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> would limit it to the police so that is very clear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245499">I agree with my colleague on the Conservative side and I am telling him that they are going to need to bring Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document> to the same standard, where we define who is eligible to ask for that information. Without doing that, we will end up going before the courts again. If we define that it is the right of the police to ask for that information, then that would meet the test that would be laid out in Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, but Bill C-12 would not meet that test right now. The issue is that there is no oversight mechanism in Bill C-12. If they did ask for this ISP information on individual users, there are no mechanisms under Bill C-12 for reporting what was happening, and that would fail the test of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245500"> It is clear that what the Conservatives had been attempting to do was to take Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was their desire to be able to snoop on as many people as they wanted as often as they wanted and however they wanted, and build in a number of other subsets in other legislation to make that operable. Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which includes changes to the Privacy Protection Act, would certainly allow them to do that. However, being that we have had the public backlash on Bill C-30 and being that we now have defined Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> very clearly regarding the who, the how and the why of this being allowed, we would need to clarify the same mechanisms under Bill C-12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245501">We see that the Conservatives are on the straight and narrow right now. They did not want to come. They were dragged, kicking and screaming, and it is our job to ensure they stay on the straight and narrow. We want to work with them. It is hard for them and we will do our part to keep them on the straight and narrow. We will do that 12-step program of accountability and I want to work with my colleagues on that, but they just keep sliding off that wagon. They want to go after personal freedoms. They want to go after individuals. They want to do that spying thing. However, they cannot do it because we have the rule of law in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245502">We are asking them to come work with us and learn from some of their colleagues who might have a little more experience in some of these matters. Certainly the Supreme Court has laid down the test that has to be met. Now that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is in place, the problems with Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document> are too clear to ignore. Then, what we need to do with Bill C-12 is to ensure that Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> will never come back and that the online snooping provisions of the current government will not come back.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245504">Mr. Speaker, section 184.4 of the Criminal Code was struck down by the Supreme Court because the lack of definitions was seriously problematic. To put it in context, we were dealing with a criminal activity that was brought to the court. This was not about spying on ordinary Canadian citizens, which some of my colleagues on the other side would like to be able to do. This was about a criminal act and still the Supreme Court said that even in the case of a criminal act, the rule of law must apply. Therefore, the government had to define who was eligible to get that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245505">In order for Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> to be charter compliant and compliant with the Supreme Court, the government has to define who is eligible and under what circumstances this breach of personal information is going to be allowed. We do not have that same standard on Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document> yet. The government wants to be able to force telecommunications companies and other private businesses to turn over data and subscriber information, but it does not define who is eligible to gather it. That is very disturbing because under Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was the other piece of this triad of puzzles we had before us, a minister was able to designate inspectors. Who were the inspectors that he was designating? That was a very bizarre and wide loophole the government was creating for itself.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245513">Mr. Speaker, what is at the heart of this issue is the fact that regardless of our political stripes, we are in the House of Commons to create legislation. We are legislators who must represent the best of Canadians. The legislation must stand the test of time. For what we create as laws now, certainly in 30, 40 or 50 years we expect that legislation should be able to hold its own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245514">Unfortunately, at committees of the House of Commons the basic rule of law has been continually undermined by a government that is starving MPs of the basic data they require in order to review legislation. The fact that we have forced closure again and again on debate means that legislation that has problems, that could become seriously problematic, that may not withstand a charter challenge, is not being reviewed adequately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245515">Therefore, we will support the bill going forward because the Supreme Court has forced the government to address this issue. Conservatives would not have addressed it otherwise. However, we are very concerned about the reporting mechanisms because we see that it is a government that seems to be the exact opposite of what we would want in western society, which is an open, transparent government and maximum privacy for citizens. The government has flipped it upside down to have absolute transparency on the rights of citizens and NGOs and on groups that oppose it, while demanding absolute secrecy for its ministers and party officials.</ParaText>

The parliamentary secretary rose in response to the disrespectful nature of comments made by numerous members of the NDP during question period, which were not conducive to maintaining order and decorum in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245800">You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that the NDP argued that disrespectful name-calling, on that day in particular, in relation to female ministers on International Women's Day, no less, should be perfectly acceptable.

              <ParaText id="3245805">The approach employed by the NDP not only personalizes debate, but it does so in an offensive and inflammatory fashion. Consider what we might expect to hear if the NDP position became the accepted practice in the chamber. If this kind of name-calling is allowed, it would apply not just to ministers and parliamentary secretaries, of course, but to opposition shadow ministers. For example, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170380" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation>, the NDP's environment critic, could well be referred to as the NDP spokesperson for creating a crippling carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245806">According to the NDP, this would be parliamentary language. I do not believe it is. Instead of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170382" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation> described as the NDP finance critic, she could instead be called the NDP spokesperson for bigger government and higher taxes, or perhaps the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> could be the spokesperson for unethical interference with independent electoral boundary commissions or, since he changed his vote on the long gun registry, maybe he could be the spokesperson for betraying rural Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245807">Again, the NDP argues that this is an entirely acceptable approach and is parliamentary. I do not agree. However, based on the response of the NDP's deputy whip on this point of order, I would surmise that he thinks it would be just fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245808">Since this betrays the NDP's numerous by-rote decorum pledges, maybe its most recent champion of decorum, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>, should be described as the NDP spokesperson for do as I say, not as I do. However, I do not agree that should be considered parliamentary. I raise these examples to point out the logical outcome if the NDP approach on arguments on this point of order prevail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245809">When you review <I>Hansard</I> from the previous sitting, Mr. Speaker, you will see that this kind of petty name-calling does not contribute to decorum, nor does it assist you in maintaining order here. It should not be accepted. Instead, let us rise above the NDP's petty stunts, avoid the name-calling and only refer to each other by our constituencies or our titles, as the rules expect of us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245832">I am very happy to take part in this debate on Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which seeks to amend the Criminal Code following the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245833">It is refreshing to see that the Conservative government is today proposing a bill that is balanced and reasonable, for once. It is true that we have become accustomed to the opposite, in recent months. It is also rather encouraging to see that this time, the government is respecting the Supreme Court’s decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245834"> We are therefore pleased to support this Bill at third reading. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> corrects some shortcomings in the Criminal Code. The effect will be to strengthen the right to privacy of all Canadians, without impeding the delicate work done by police officers and law enforcement agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245835"> I would like to point out, however, that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> follows the now famous Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. I say “famous”, but Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> is mainly famous for the fire it drew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245836"> I will take the liberty of returning briefly to this famous, or should I say “infamous”, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. Officially, it was designed to protect children against online predators. In fact, it gave law enforcement agencies the power to request personal information about telephone and Internet service subscribers, without a warrant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245837"> The indignation was general, beginning with that of Canadians as a whole, who rightly saw it as a threat to their privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245838"> On the pretext of tracking down pedophiles, the government was giving itself authority thenceforth to treat all Canadians as criminals. Without the commission of any offence, the private lives of thousands if not millions of Canadians would have been made public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245839"> People thus no longer have control over the protection of privacy, since intrusion is achieved by such underhand means as their use of the Internet and of telephone services, the most commonplace communication media most widely used by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245840"> The government was also criticized by Jennifer Stoddart, Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and her provincial counterparts. According to Ms. Stoddart, if Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> had been passed, it would have enabled police officers to establish a picture of Canadians' online activities. For example, police officers could have identified individuals' interests based on the websites they visited, the organizations and associations to which they belonged and their geographic location. That is a bit much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245841"> The government's initial reaction to the criticism is equally disturbing. The <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> responded to individuals who had expressed concerns about privacy protection by saying that they had a choice whether to stand with the government or with the pedophiles. That is completely ridiculous and disrespectful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245842"> This government has the unfortunate habit of reducing all debates to a conflict between good and evil, without drawing any distinction. Listening to it, one would think that all Canadians who doubt the effectiveness of such an intrusive bill simply sanction the acts of pedophiles. That is a highly simplistic view.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245843"> When I stop and think of all the implications of that bill, I get chills down my spine. I do not believe I am the only one who does. That bill clearly made many members on the other side of the House very uncomfortable. As a democratic country, Canada long ago established that citizens' right to privacy is not negligible or alienable. The government's paranoia does not justify destroying that fundamental right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245844"> Although it took a long time, the government ultimately decided to abandon Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> to everyone's great relief. Members on all sides of the House were delighted when the bill was dropped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245845"> The day after Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was scrapped, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170573" Type="2">New Brunswick Southwest</Affiliation> said he was pleased with the government's new direction on this file, and I quote: “There is no justification in a free country with judicial oversight to force Internet companies to disclose information about their customers without a warrant.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245846"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="170123" Type="2">Edmonton—St. Albert</Affiliation> said, and I quote, “The government went too far.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245847"> Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which is before us today, is much more balanced. It updates provisions respecting wiretapping that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245848"> The bill amends the Criminal Code to provide for measures to protect the power to intercept private communications without judicial authorization. In concrete terms, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the attorney general of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4. That was not required before Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. That was therefore a shortcoming of the other bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245849"> Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> also provides that a person who has been the object of such an interception must be notified of the interception within a specific period. It narrows the class of individuals who may make such an interception and limits those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245850"> We therefore support this bill because it is essential that these investigative measures include oversight and accountability mechanisms, which the Conservatives are not necessarily in the habit of applying and including in their bills. That is the court's view, and we expected nothing less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245851"> Moreover, the requirement to notify people whose communications are intercepted would in no way impede police operations in emergencies, since it will be done after the fact. On the other hand, it would increase the ability of those targeted to track and object to infringements of their privacy, and obtain genuine redress if that was the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245852"> I have dwelt at length on the fact that Canadians have excellent reasons for apprehension about the Conservatives’ bills relating to privacy. Their track record in this area is not very impressive. We are therefore greatly reassured that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> respects the rule of law, the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245853"> We must nevertheless remain vigilant. Political pressure recently led to the defeat of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, but some of the measures it contained have reappeared in other federal bills. Canadians, and defenders of civil liberties, have won a fight against lawful access, but they are still on alert. There is no way of knowing if and when the government will try once again to attack Canadians’ rights to privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245854"> The government was stubborn in its protracted pursuit of passage for Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. After that fiasco, can the government tell us whether its justice priorities will be based on the charter and the Constitution, rather than the Conservatives’ political program?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245855"> Because that is definitely what concerns us: Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> merely resolves one very simple issue, yet the Conservatives took a long time to introduce it. Other measures initially included in Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> may now be placed beyond the jurisdiction of the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245856"> The opposition parties must stay alert. We must ensure that Canadians are not threatened once again with the loss of their right to privacy through another Big Brother-style bill introduced by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245857"> We therefore say yes to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, but we must take great care to ensure that in future, all bills presented that relate to justice and public safety are consistent both with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution in order to be passed by the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245858">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> today. I am thankful to my friend, the very hard-working member for <Affiliation DbId="170535" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation>, for her kind attention to it also.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245859">The bill is really about striking a balance between personal freedom and public safety that was not achieved with the previous bill, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. In the five years or so that I have been here, I cannot recall a topic or bill that has caused so much reaction from constituents. There may be one or two other bills that the constituents in my riding have been very concerned about, but reaction to this one in particular was certainly inflamed by the comments made by the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> when Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was introduced. I am pleased that something is now being done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245860">I am not sure whether the government is doing this now for political reasons or because the Supreme Court has said that it has until next month to have these amendments ready. In any case, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is certainly a welcome change and welcome difference from the previous bill, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245861">For those folks who might be watching at home, I want to talk about the bill for a second and give a bit of background.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245862">This enactment amends the Criminal Code in response to the Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Tse in order to provide safeguards relating to authorization to intercept private communications without prior judicial authorization under section 184.4. Notably, the enactment requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Attorney General of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under that section. It also provides that a person who has been the subject of such interception must be notified of the interception within a specified period. As well, it narrows the class of individuals who can make such an interception and limits those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. On one hand it has been narrowed, but it is also now putting in the safeguards that Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> did not have to ensure that the personal freedom of Canadians is not infringed upon unduly while public safety is served. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245863">This does strike a nice balance. That is why the NDP and I will certainly be supporting the bill at third reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245864">In its simplest terms, this new legislation is simply an updated version of the wiretapping provisions that the Supreme Court has ruled to be unconstitutional. The court has established new parameters for the protection of privacy. We in the NDP believe that this legislation complies with those standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245865">Canadians have good reason to be concerned about Conservatives' privacy legislation. It seems to not be front and centre or at least top of mind when legislation is put together, so the ruling of the Supreme Court was certainly welcome, and Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which is a result of that ruling, is also certainly welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245866">The proposed amendments appear in direct response to the Supreme Court decision. They add safeguards that constitute notification and reporting under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code. Specifically, the legislation would require giving a person 90 days' notice—although there could be an extension made by a judge—after his or her private communications have been intercepted in situations of “imminent harm”, which are two very important words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245867">The bill also requires the preparation of annual reports on the use of wiretaps. These amendments appear to be in direct response to the court's instruction in this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245868">As a result, we support the bill. It is essential that such investigative measures include oversight and accountability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245869">We have certainly heard, and my constituents have heard, over and over again from this government those terms “oversight”, “accountability” and “transparency”. Certainly Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the original incarnation of this bill, did not include any of those things. This new bill, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, does, and as I said before, it is welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245870">When New Democrats look at the bill, we look at the public interest of the bill and respect for the rule of law. That is why Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was a bill that we simply could not support: it failed on both of those counts. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, after we have studied it, certainly would appear to do that, and we will be supporting it at third reading. Most importantly, it would meet the rule of law, the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We do not expect that there would be a further Supreme Court case on Bill C-55.</ParaText>

Among other things, this enactment requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Attorney General of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4. This was a glaring omission in the previous bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245895">It also provides that a person who has been the object of such an interception must be notified of the interception within a specified period, which has yet to be defined. We are probably going to need another case before the Supreme Court to define that period. The bill also narrows the class of individuals who can make such an interception and limits those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. I will spare hon. members the hundreds of offences listed in that section.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245896">These measures are the Conservative government's answer to the humiliating failure, for the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, and to the Supreme Court decision in R. v.

Despite the issues we have raised, we will support this new version at third reading stage, because the Supreme Court response provides enough new parameters to protect privacy, and because we really believe that this bill complies with those standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245897">For the NDP, basic human rights are essential to ensuring that justice is done in this country. We are receptive to all initiatives that are in line with that. Unfortunately, Canadians have seen this Conservative government make many errors in judgment since it got, or rather borrowed, a majority in the last election. Consequently, they have good reasons to be concerned and even worried about Conservative bills that deal with their privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245898">The Conservatives' record in this regard is less than stellar. However, we remain convinced that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, the Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in R. v. Tse Act, respects the rule of the law, the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245899"> Which is more important? Protecting privacy to safeguard individual interests, or invading privacy by means of various provisions in the interest of national public safety? In both instances, where do the limits lie? These questions are essential to understanding today's debate on this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245900"> Unfortunately, owing to a shortage of information about certain issues, we will not be discussing section 184.4, particularly its excessive scope resulting from the power it can give peace officers other than police officers. On this point, we do not believe that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> contains enough definitions to delineate the scope of certain adjustments to the section in question. Who can be a peace officer? Can it be a private agency? Who precisely can it be? More details should have been provided about this to prevent the Supreme Court from having to redefine a number of matters in a specific case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245901">R. v. Tse challenged the constitutionality of the emergency wiretapping provisions allowed under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245902"> The presiding judge ruled that this provision breached the right guaranteed by section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, namely that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. However, the Supreme Court justice in this case also ruled that emergency wiretaps without the authorization of the court could be justified under the charter. Which brings us back to the same question. What is more important, the right to privacy or national public safety? The answer is not clear. Eventually, we will need an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245903"> According to the decision, section 184.4 of the Criminal Code is unconstitutional because it does not have accountability measures with respect to wiretapping. That is why the court specified a time limit for us, the legislators, to amend the provision to make it constitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245904"> The proposed amendments are a direct response to this decision. The bill would require notification within 90 days to any person whose private communications have been intercepted in circumstances of imminent harm. The bill would also require the preparation of annual reports on the use of wiretapping under the section in question. The amendments would also limit police authorization to use this provision and would restrict its use to the offences listed at length in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245905"> The key question in all of this is whether the power conferred under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code establishes a constitutional balance between an individual's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and society’s interest in preventing serious harm. We know, since 9/11, the Air India attack and a number of other major incidents that many issues have been raised with respect to wiretapping and the disclosure of information through these procedures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245906">Correctly interpreted, these conditions would ensure that the power to intercept private communications without judicial authorization can only be exercised in urgent situations in order to avoid serious harm. This clause strikes a fair balance between the rights guaranteed under section 8 of the charter and society's interest in preventing serious harm. The legislation does not provide for accountability though, in that it does not set out a mechanism for oversight of the police use of the power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245907">A troubling aspect of section 184.4 is the fact that a person does not need to be notified if their private communications have been intercepted. That is why section 184.4 violates section 8 of the charter. However, we feel that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is a sufficient response to Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and to all of the questions that were raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245908">To conclude, we have long been calling on the Conservative government to introduce a bill that responds to the ruling in R. v. Tse. This response is very last-minute. Why did the government wait so long? Why did it not listen to what all the witnesses in committee had to say about this issue again? Debate must take place here, but also in committee. We have a wonderful justice critic—the member for Gatineau. She does an excellent job on the committee and in her role.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245927">Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to stand and speak to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> on behalf of our party and on behalf of the constituents of Parkdale—High Park. We are glad to see that the government is finally responding to an important obligation, as illustrated not only through our Charter of Rights and Freedoms but also as dictated by the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245928">It is ironic that based on a Supreme Court decision, the government has until April 13, 2013, to comply, and it is scrambling to get this legislation passed. It is ironic, because I am the NDP's finance critic, and I have seen over the last year how the government has brought closure and time allocation time and time again to limit debate. I have seen how it has rammed through legislation on a whole range of Conservative priorities and how it has bundled seemingly disparate pieces of legislation into omnibus budget bills and has pushed them through the House with amazing speed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245929">Yet here is an obligation to protect civil liberties, an obligation to comply with our Charter of Rights and Freedoms and an obligation to protect the privacy rights and civil liberties of Canadians, and we have seen the government dragging its heels over the last year. I can only conclude that when it comes to protecting the oil industry, the government works with amazing speed, but when it comes to protecting civil liberties, it seems to not have the same amount of speed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245930">Nevertheless, we are glad to see Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> before the House, and we believe that it is essential that it be passed. The bill is about wiretapping. It addresses the public's concern that the ability of our security and police forces to engage in wiretapping is a right that is balanced between personal freedom and the need to ensure quick action when public safety is at risk. It is the ability of citizens to not have undue surveillance of them or to at least be informed if they are the targets of such surveillance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245931">What are we talking about with respect to wiretapping? This goes to section 184.4 of the Criminal Code. Under that section, a peace officer would be allowed to intercept and essentially wiretap private communications if the peace officer believed, on reasonable grounds, that the urgency of the situation was such that authorization could not be sought with reasonable diligence or obtained under any other provision, meaning that a delay would cause serious harm to public safety. It would also be allowed in a situation where the peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe that wiretapping, or an interception of private communications, was necessary to prevent an unlawful act that would cause serious harm to persons or property and that the originator of the private communication or the person intended by the originator to receive the communication was the person who would perform the act that would be likely to cause or harm the intended victim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245932">We are talking about a potential situation where a crime or public harm could take place and where there would not be the normal ability to seek proper approvals from the proper authorities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245933">This dates back to a 1993 law that has been tested by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found that, in fact, the law was overstepping the rights of Canadians under the charter. It gave the government a year, up until April 13, to correct the legislation. That is what we are dealing with today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245934">It is important that electronic surveillance, or wiretapping, is a measure that must include oversight and accountability so that the public is protected. The court has now said that we should expect nothing less. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245935">We have studied the bill in the public interest and with respect to the rule of law, the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We note that the government had intended with a previous bill, Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, and with other pieces of legislation to extend the rights of the state to intercept private communications. I remember one quote from the public safety minister, which became rather famous, which was that if we did not support the bill on that matter, we were with him or with the child pornographers. That, of course, was horrifying to many Canadians who just wanted to make sure that their privacy rights were protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245936">We believe that these changes are reasonable and that they are compliant with the Supreme Court decision. We note that there are many who have validated this position. They were heard at the committee studying the bill. The Criminal Lawyers' Association, the Canadian Bar Association, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and other organizations all testified that the bill would lead the government to comply with the Supreme Court decision, and they all supported these changes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245937">In essence, the changes would require the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Attorney General of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4, which I outlined earlier. They would provide that a person who has been the object of such an interception would be notified within a specified period. They would narrow the class of individuals who could make such an interception and would limit those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245938">Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is an updated version of the wiretapping provisions the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional. The court has established new parameters for the protection of privacy, and we believe that the legislation complies with those standards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245939">Canadians have good reason to be concerned about other measures the Conservatives were putting forward that would expand the government's ability to intercept communications. Their record has not been terrific on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245940">We are in favour of Bill C-55 in that it upholds the rule of law, the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We support these measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245941">We are concerned that the government left the introduction of the bill for so long while it was gutting environmental provisions, changing the Navigable Waters Protection Act and cutting food inspectors and CRA investigators. These provisions were rammed through under its budget implementation act. Yet something the government is compelled to do through a Supreme Court decision it left until the 11th hour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245942">I see that my time is up. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this and to defend the human rights and civil liberties of our constituents and Canadians. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3245956">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> on third reading today. We will now be able to witness the culmination of this process and, at last, correct a big problem in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245957">Something was revealed in a court case. In R. v. Tse, the appeal challenging the constitutionality of the emergency wiretapping provisions under section 184.4 of the Criminal Code, police officers simply tried to use a provision in the Criminal Code. They no doubt did so in good faith, pending judicial authorization. They sensed that there was a relative urgency, but that urgency was unfortunately unfounded in the view of the judge who heard the appeal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245958"> First, it must be understood that section 184.4 of the Criminal Code is an exceptional provision, which means that it is not to be used under just any circumstances. That is the most important point to bear in mind. Other sections of the Criminal Code—sections 186 and 188, if my memory serves me—make wiretapping options available to police officers so they can monitor communications in other circumstances without judicial authorization. Section 184.4 makes it possible to address the exceptional nature of a really serious emergency with immediate and significant consequences for an individual contemplated by the section. In such instances, it permits police officers to act on their own initiative without that other authorization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245959"> We can all agree that this applies to only a very limited number of cases under the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245960"> In R. v. Tse, as I said a little earlier, police officers had obtained judicial authorization to intercept communications under section 186 of the Criminal Code 24 hours later. Their action was therefore warranted. They had grounds to continue intercepting communications. They were able to show the judge that it was entirely justifiable. However, again according to the judge who heard the appeal respecting the provision's constitutionality, that did not prevent the officers who used section 184.4 when they began wiretapping from violating the right guaranteed by section 8 of the charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245961"> The other very important aspect is that this was not a reasonable limit under section 1. This is important because the court ultimately held that the police officers had exceeded the authority granted them under section 184.4. Consequently, there was a problem. The government department appealed the ruling of unconstitutionality directly to the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal. That put an end to the debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245962"> The problem is that the government department had barely one year from that point to remedy the situation. I say “barely one year”, because in a few days’ time, the deadline will be upon us when section 184.4 could potentially be invalidated if the government fails to act. That is one problem. How is it that in March 2013, nearly one year after the government department was presented with the facts, it had yet to take action or introduce a bill like Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> to remedy the situation? That is the first question I have, one that calls attention to the government’s responsibility in this matter. That is a problem.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3245963"> Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> raises another interesting consideration. As it now stands, section 184.4 authorizes a peace officer, in exceptional circumstances, to intercept, using an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, a private communication when certain conditions are present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245964"> However, the definition of “peace officer” is quite broad and extends to persons other than police officers. For example, the serving mayor of a municipality could be considered a peace officer. This was another problem that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> was set to remedy. We are reasonably satisfied that in the bill, the term “police officer” is defined and that this definition is included in section 184.4, replacing the definition of “peace officer”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245965"> This amendment limits the use of this very exceptional provision to those rare instances where no other measures are possible, for example, where it is impossible to obtain a warrant from a judge and where the situation is urgent. The amendment also limits the use of this exceptional provision to persons belonging to a very specific, authorized category of individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245966"> In that regard, the bill is very satisfactory. After receiving some assurances from the government department, we expressed our satisfaction and voiced our support for this measure. The NDP was not alone in doing so. Various groups that testified before the committee also expressed their satisfaction at seeing section 184.4 amended to limit its use and clarify its exceptional nature. This is a significant step forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245967"> Another consideration raised in the appeal is the question of accountability in connection with the use of section 184.4. A very significant problem was flagged. The exceptional use of this measure can be limited to a very specific category of officers. However, some kind of evidence that this provision has been used must exist. A person who is the object of an interception under this section cannot be totally unaware that this measure is being used in certain instances. This is another important matter to consider. We must not lose sight of the fact that this provision or other means of court-authorized interception can be used in the course of an investigation, before a case goes to court. This means that if there are no accountability measures after the fact, the person who is the object of an interception will never know that his communications are being intercepted or will only find out about it by chance, depending on how circumstances play out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245968">This is something that the court found to be unacceptable and intolerable and that had to be corrected immediately. This is another measure of satisfaction. That is no secret; I have mentioned it before. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> can be used as a procedural model for the government for presenting bills that are in an acceptable form consistent with the charter. This would make it possible for the government to get the approval of all members of the House, and that is the goal after all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245980"> While this is not exactly high praise, I must admit that the government did a good job, even though it was forced to do so as a result of R. v. Tse. There is no hiding the fact that its arm was being twisted. The government is unfortunately not a very good student. I want to remind the House of some unpleasant memories of Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was luckily set aside, but which is not yet completely dead. Sadly, it haunts us still.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245981"> Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> illustrates this government’s errant ways. It is a serious matter. The <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> managed to highly polarize debate by saying that anyone who had any concerns or potential quarrels with Bill C-30 was on the side of the pedophiles. This kind of behaviour on the part of the minister is inappropriate. It is absolutely unbelievable!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245982"> Let us hope that the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> will in due course listen to reason. I hope that he will, because he has regrettably been stuck in a rut for many years now. It is very difficult for a person to change himself and improve his behaviour. It is a serious problem that definitely poisons debate and the atmosphere in the House and the committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245983"> I witnessed his behaviour first-hand at meetings of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. When government members of this committee felt they were losing control of the debate, they would lose their self-control, hurl insults at us and ultimately paralyze debate and consideration of these bills. It was truly unbelievable!</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245984"> It was really counterproductive and particularly ironic. In 2008, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, claiming that the House and committees were dysfunctional, called a general election, contrary to Canada's fixed date election legislation. The tables certainly turned. It would be funny if it were not so sad. But it was a fact of life and sadly, the people were taken hostage and had to bear the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245985"> I am now going to speak on another matter on which I would like to tip my hat to the government. I have a few compliments once again, but first, some criticism. Sadly, when I sat on various committees, I observed that the government too readily discredited witnesses whose opinions were inconsistent with what the government wanted. This is truly distressing. Fortunately, for Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>, the witnesses were more or less in favour of its adoption, raising only minor details and observations about specific features of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245986">I want to tell the House that during the examination of private members' bills brought forward by Conservative members, some witnesses were practically accused of crimes for disagreeing. I can tell this House that some witnesses were questioned about the fact that they had donated funds to the NDP, as though that were a crime. How is a lawful political contribution a crime? Can someone explain that to us? I find that completely unbelievable. This is one very specific example of something completely counterproductive that happened in committee. Unfortunately, the government repeatedly uses this kind of tactic to try to get its agenda approved, even though the law is basically a mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245987">It is hard to criticize someone for defending their point of view when they are so sure they are right. On the contrary, I admire and respect people who defend their point of view and who are convinced, based on the information they have and their own personal experiences, that they are right, and who try to persuade a political opponent to adopt that point of view. That is completely understandable. Unfortunately, the current government has a tendency to become trapped in its own ideology, to lock itself in a room with just a bare light bulb, to stare at its own navel and try to force other people to adopt whatever opinion it thinks is the absolute truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3245988">After giving specific examples, after calling out the government on some of its inappropriate behaviour and after saying in good faith that there is a way for us to work together—we reached out to the government repeatedly—I hope it will regard Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> as an example to follow and that it will finally respect all Canadians, that is, all of the legitimately elected representatives who sit in the House, in order to work productively, rationally and respectfully, to hold real debates in the hopes of achieving better results.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3245999">I will focus on the report to Parliament. First of all, Parliament has a very important oversight function. It is therefore essential that Parliament be informed, regardless of whether other parties can be informed. What is interesting, given that the minister will also have to inform the person who was the subject of wiretapping, is that, in the specific situation where a case goes to court, the person will not be completely in the dark, except for accidental disclosure. I think it is a very important point to consider. Basically, this supports protection that is already in the charter, and it fulfills a fundamental duty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246000">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170303" Type="2">Saint-Lambert</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246001">The way I understand this bill, it is a reaction to Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was introduced previously, and although it was thought that it would solve problems related to wiretaps, it did not, and proved to be a mistake. Therefore, we now have another bill, which tends to have a more balanced approach to this whole issue, as many of my colleagues have said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246002">I know we have heard it before, but I will reiterate that what this bill would basically do is amend the Criminal Code to provide a response to the Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Tse on safeguards related to the authorization to intercept private communications without prior judicial authorization under section 184.4. In other words, it would provide safeguards for when this kind of action takes place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246003">It would require the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Attorney General of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4. I am not a lawyer, but I am a Canadian citizen, so I understand that when this type of thing happens, it is important for people to know. If somebody is wiretapping my phone, then I should certainly know it has happened, whether it is justifiable or not. At least I would know and could react appropriately. That is a good point in this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246004">It would also provide that a person who has been the object of such an interception be notified of the interception within a specified period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246005">It would narrow the class of individuals who can make such an interception, which obviously makes sense, and would limit those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246006"> In my analysis of this bill, it is very sound. This legislation is an updated version of the wiretapping provisions that the Supreme Court has deemed to be unconstitutional. It would establish new parameters for the protection of privacy, and my party believes this legislation complies with those standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246007">In the R. v. Tse case, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that authorization of the emergency power to intercept without authorization by the court in situations of imminent harm could be justified under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court held that section 184.4 of the Criminal Code, enacted in 1993, was unconstitutional because it did not include any accountability measures, and it gave Parliament until April 13, 2013, to amend the provision to make it constitutional. It seems we are sort of just under the wire, but it looks as if we will make it, as it is not yet April 13.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246008">I would like to refer to some of the comments that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation> made when she spoke on the bill a while ago in the House. She mentioned that the Supreme Court handed down a decision in the R. v. Tse case and urged colleagues in the House to read the decision before voting on Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. She said there is no real need to read all 50 pages of the decision, but at least the summary, because it gives a good explanation of the problem arising from the section on invasion of privacy. She said that, believe it or not, that is what it is called. In the Criminal Code the section concerns invasion of privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246009">Just as an aside, as a concerned citizen, I say it is important that if there is an invasion of privacy, there is justification for it and the person whose privacy is invaded knows exactly what is going on. Once again, this bill tackles that concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246010">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation> went on to say that the section on invasion of privacy pertains to very specific cases that must be considered within the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. She said the authorities must ensure that the circumstances in question actually constitute an invasion of privacy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246011">We live in a democratic society, not a totalitarian state. There has to be justification when there is an invasion of privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246012">She went on to say that most of the section provided some checks and required the Crown and the police to obtain certain authorizations, and that section 184.4 had proven to be problematic in this regard because it was rather unclear about wiretapping and that unless an indictment were filed against the people in question, they would never know they were being wiretapped. The way I understand it, this would be meant to fix that loophole in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>

Approximately 24 hours later, the police obtained a judicial authorization for continued interceptions, pursuant to s. 186 of the Code.

              <ParaText id="3246029"> We have indicated that the Liberal Party supports its passage. We share the concerns in terms of the manner in which the government waited for the Supreme Court to put a decision in place with respect to the timeline, that being April 12, which is why it is we have the bill here today. It is fair to say that the government has been negligent in bringing forward the bill in a more timely fashion. Ultimately, as a result of that, we have lost the opportunity we could have had if it had brought it in last fall in September, which would have afforded much more dialogue on the important issue of individual rights and so forth.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246040">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246041"> First and foremost, this legislation will make it possible to comply with the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Tse, dated April 13, 2012. Our highest judicial authorities have thus determined that wiretaps in situations of imminent harm can be justified under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms without judicial authority, provided law enforcement is governed by an accountability mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246042"> Section 184.4, which became law in 1993 and allows wiretapping without a warrant, did not meet this requirement. For that reason, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and her colleagues declared it unconstitutional. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246043"> In their judgment, they emphasized that in certain circumstances, the interests of individuals may have to yield temporarily for the greater good of society. However, the Supreme Court justices deplored the fact that section 184.4 fails to provide a mechanism for accountability, and more particularly, notice to persons whose private communications have been intercepted, and contains no accountability measures to permit oversight of the use of the power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246044"> It is important to note that this judgment gave the government a year in which to comply with their decision, which means three weeks from now. I wish to point out that the NDP has been urging the Conservatives for months to take action in this matter. I have some difficulty in believing that it took the minister’s officials eleven months to produce this bill. I rather tend to believe that, once again, instead of taking the lead, consulting interested parties and gathering suggestions from the opposition, the Conservative government decided to wait until the last minute to introduce its bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246045"> Be that as it may, we are assured that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> meets the requirements of R. v. Tse. We found it necessary that this legislation should comply with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and respect Canadian legal principles. We also wanted it to address the concerns of Canadians about respect for privacy, and the balance between public safety and individual rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246046"> Bill C-55 will limit the warrantless interception of private communications to the offences specified in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246047"> Consequently, the practice will be restricted to offences such as high treason, the possession or use of explosives, terrorist activity or corruption. We believe this section will make it possible to meet the requirements of R. v. Tse, to the extent that it provides a more restrictive framework for the application of section 184.4. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246048"> This bill will also limit the kinds of person authorized to conduct interceptions of this kind without judicial authority. Only police officers will be able to do so, which again places limits on aspects involving the privacy of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246049"> Another very important aspect is that Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> requires the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and Emergency Preparedness and the attorney general of each province to report on the interception of private communications made under section 184.4. A number of things will henceforth be made public that are not, as matters stand now. These include the number of interceptions made, and the number of persons targeted. We will also be able to obtain information on the offences in respect of which interceptions were made, the methods of interception used and the results of the interceptions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246050"> The NDP supports this aspect, which has been put forward in response to the Supreme Court judgment. We have always argued in favour of healthy privacy practices and we constantly ask the government to be transparent in many respects. Clause 3 of the bill clearly addresses that position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246051"> Lastly, Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> provides that any person who was the object of an interception shall be given notice in writing within 90 days. This last measure will also respond to the imperatives identified by R. v. Tse. We believe it goes without saying that individuals whose privacy has been affected by the application of section 184.4 of the Criminal Code are fully entitled to be informed of that state of affairs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246052"> However, we are concerned about the procedures that could extend notification periods to up to three years. This is an aspect that will clearly be discussed in committee in order to preclude any judgment that would require parliamentarians to redo their homework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246053"> In light of these aspects, I believe that parliamentarians in the House should pass Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> at third reading. First of all, this legislative framework addresses the loopholes identified by the Supreme Court judgment. As the notice issued by the highest judicial authority in the land will expire in three weeks, it is also essential that we move forward quickly with this updating of Canada's Criminal Code. Bill C-55 also strikes a fair balance between security imperatives and respect for privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246054"> Lastly, the proposed amendments were supported in committee by several representatives, including the Criminal Lawyers' Association, the Canadian Bar Association and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association. However, the Conservatives' obligation to move forward with Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> must send a clear message, particularly after Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> on the interception of electronic communications was withdrawn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246055"> The security of Canadians is essential, but the right to privacy is also important. Our duty as parliamentarians is to strike a balance between those two things. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is a good example, one that proves it is possible to guarantee the security of our fellow citizens while providing an effective framework for the powers conferred on our security services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246056"> However, it is unfortunate that the Conservatives defend purely ideological decisions until they are backed into a corner by public opinion, the players on the ground or judicial authorities. That is the real problem with this government. Our duty as the official opposition is to monitor the government's actions to ensure that measures such as those contained in Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> or section 184.4 are not secretly brought forward by regulation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246062">Unquestionably, the invasion of privacy is a critically important consideration.

              <ParaText id="3246063">Mr. Speaker, it is important to recognize that the primary purpose of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> is to enable, in a lawful fashion, a police officer or agency to intercept or listen in on a wiretap or a private conversation without a warrant. That is really what the bill is all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246064">To be able to do something of this nature without a warrant raises a great deal of concern and that is why the Supreme Court has said that we have to fix this fundamental flaw in the law. Having said that, part of the legislation says that we would now require provinces, or the minister of justice in a particular province, to provide a report on the number of times this clause would have been used without a warrant. We see that as a positive thing. It ensures there is accountability. We believe the number of times it would be used to tap into a private conversation without a warrant should be somewhat minimal. Therefore, that would justify having the provinces provide an annual report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246065">I am wondering if the member might want to comment on how important it is that we have accountability when we allow for warrantless wiretaps.</ParaText>

Tse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246070">This bill is now at third reading and the NDP will support it. The bill finally corrects a number of previous errors. In response to the Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Tse, it amends the Criminal Code to provide for safeguards related to the authority to intercept private communications without prior judicial authorization under section 184.4 of the Code. The bill makes three provisions in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246071">First, it requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the attorney general of each province to report on the interceptions of private communications made under section 184.4. Second, it provides that a person who has been the object of such an interception must be notified of the interception within a specified period. Third, it narrows the class of individuals who may make such an interception and, lastly, limits those interceptions to offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246072">We are genuinely pleased that the Conservative government has finally introduced Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. I say "finally" because the government has dragged its feet on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246073"> This bill refers to the obligation set by the Supreme Court, which revealed a deficiency. There was an imbalance between the right to privacy under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the right to security. There was thus an intrusion of privacy. That is why this bill now strikes a balance between the right to privacy and the right to security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246074"> We now have accountability. Now no one may engage in wiretapping at will, without being accountable. A person who has been wiretapped must be notified within 90 days. Why is this aspect important? Now if an individual who has been wiretapped believes that his or her right to privacy under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has been violated, that individual may institute legal proceedings against the individuals in question and seek redress. That will help limit overzealous peace officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246075"> In addition, the number of individuals who may conduct wiretap will now be limited, a fact that also helps strike a balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246076"> However, the bill is also a response to a total failure by the Conservative government after it introduced its infamous Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. That bill constituted a direct attack on people's right to privacy and certainly violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was also drafted by the Conservatives in a wholly improvised manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246077"> It is very important that the NDP remind the Conservatives how crucially important and even essential it is for them to scrutinize all new bills they table in the House of Commons in future. Those bills will have to be well analyzed and checked, and reviewed by lawyers to be sure that they comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246078"> As a result, the Supreme Court will not be required to hear lengthy and costly cases that waste the precious time of all Canadians. That is essential, and I want to recall that point so that the Conservatives learn a good lesson from it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246079"> It is very important to go through all the stages in a democratic process properly. Unfortunately, the Conservatives have a bad habit of wanting to do everything at lightning speed without due regard to the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246080"> I need only recall its bad budget implementation legislation, Bills <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, omnibus bills of 400 pages each that prevent us from doing our democratic job and from getting to the bottom of things, just as the notorious Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246081"> In that case, the bill does not make it through the process to committee stage and is neither examined nor evaluated. If there are any deficiencies or aspects that do not comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or are unconstitutional, we wind up with a botched job and have to turn to the Supreme Court to assert our rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246082"> That is why the judgment in R. v. Tse is important. I hope it will finally teach the Conservative government a lesson so that it acts in a systematic and democratic manner in future in order to ensure compliance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246083"> I will go into slightly greater detail on the subject of Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>. This bill requires that an individual whose private communications have been intercepted in situations of imminent harm be notified of the situation within 90 days, subject to any extension of that period granted by a judge. The bill would also require annual reports to be prepared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246084"> The preparation of annual reports on interceptions of telephone surveillance is truly important in determining whether abusive wiretap has taken place and in being able to monitor such wiretaps. The requirement to prepare an annual report will help keep an eye on all that. The reports will also enable other authorities, such as the Office of the Auditor General, to monitor what is being done in that regard to ensure that the act and the spirit of the act are complied with, that there are no abuses of justice and that the privacy of Canadian citizens is respected. Annual reports must be prepared on the manner in which information intercepted under section 184.4 is used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246085"> These amendments would also limit the authorization that police officers are granted to use this provision. As I mentioned, all peace officers currently have access to it. Its use would thus be limited to the offences set out in section 183 of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246086"> It is very important that there be accountability for this wiretapping. We know that there may be threats or moments when a security breach can suddenly call for warrantless wiretaps. At that point, however, there must be accountability because there must be no serious abuses or violations of citizens' privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246087"> On that point, I consider it important to note again that the NDP believes it has a duty to ensure compliance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that public safety is not undermined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246088"> To sum up, it is important to remember that this new bill is no more than an update of wiretapping provisions that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional. The court also set new parameters for the protection of privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246089"> We believe that the bill meets the standards, and that Canadians have good reasons for apprehension about the Conservatives’ bill with respect to privacy. As I said, their track record in this area is not very impressive. Fortunately, this bill brings balance to the earlier imbalance. We must continue to be vigilant, however.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246090"> The NDP will continue to be vigilant with respect to the Conservatives’ bills. In the past, we have seen abuses. We saw abuse in the infamous Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>. We have also seen the familiar dichotomy that the Conservatives love to present, whereby everything is either black or white, but there is no grey, so that is completely false. Bills must be referred to committee for study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246091"> I am happy that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170262" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation> has returned to hear my comments, because he quite rightly mentioned just now the importance of committee work, and how essential committee work is to a sound democracy. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. Like my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170262" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation>, I know how very important this little-known work is. We meet with experts, and we propose amendments and additions to bills to ensure that they are as close to perfect as possible, that they respect the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution, and that they will be worthwhile and improve the well-being of Canadians in our wonderful country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246092"> In closing, we find Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> well constructed. We appreciate it, because it finally brings balance between privacy and the need for security. That does not mean that we support all of the Conservatives’ bills. On the contrary, they have introduced abusive and infamous bills in the past. Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was a horror—need I say again— because it was an absolute threat to people’s privacy. It was a purely conservative bill in the ideological sense of the term. It was an ideological vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246093"> I know that members who sit on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights criticized Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> repeatedly. I further believe that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170262" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation> was a member of the committee at the time. No, not quite. However, I know that other colleagues, for example my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, worked very hard to criticize the infamous Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, which was a genuine threat to privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246094"> Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> regrettably demonstrated that the Conservatives can often say outrageous things. Truly outrageous things were said in the House when Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> was introduced. There were incredible dichotomous comments such as “either you are in favour of security and safety or you are on the side of the pedophiles”. It was a horrible speech with no room for grey areas or other comments. After all that, they backed down on Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document> and introduced a bill that made sense—Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>.

                <B>Mr. François Choquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not do this often but they need to be given credit where credit is due. To be honest, the Conservatives sometimes get things right. Not often, but if they will allow us to vote in favour of their Bill, then we are going to do so. We are therefore going to support the Conservatives’ bill at third reading. I believe that the bill is balanced, as I have said before.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246101">In the justice committee meetings, a few witnesses mentioned why they supported this legislation. For example, the Criminal Lawyers' Association was in favour of this bill. It generally supports modest, fair and constitutional legislation. That is what its representatives said. Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document> does an admirable job of incorporating the comments of the Supreme Court of Canada in <I>R. v. Tse</I>. However, they said that there were some parts that the committee could have perhaps spent more time on. They also mentioned that Bill C-55 was a positive legislative measure, as I just said, and that it seeks to find a better balance between protection of the public and protection of privacy, which we think counts the most when it comes to Bill <Document DbId="5970787" Type="3">C-55</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246122">Canada is known throughout the world as one of the best countries in which to live. One of the reasons for this reputation is our strong sense of social responsibility. We care about our fellow citizens and we work together to ensure that everyone can fulfill their potential and enjoy a high quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246123">Charitable organizations put these core values into practice. They do valuable work in our communities, helping those in need and creating a strong, compassionate and inclusive society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246124">As the member of Parliament for Kitchener—Waterloo, I have been working since first being elected in 2008 to foster valuable partnerships with the many charitable organizations in my community and across Canada. I have to say that I am constantly impressed by the remarkable work they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246125"> I commend them and all of their volunteers for their commitment to improving the lives of others and for contributing to the quality of life we enjoy here in Canada. However, I do recognize that charities face complex challenges, and adequate funding continues to be an overriding concern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246126">During the global recession, many organizations saw a drop in donations while demand for their services increased. Stats Canada reported a decline in donations of over 5% in both 2008 and 2009, and while the latest statistics show an increase as our economic recovery takes effect, the current level of donations is still below that of 2007.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246127">With respect to the overall donor base in Canada, the 2010 Canadian survey of giving, volunteering and participating indicates that 25% of donors provide almost 85% of all charitable donations. In other words, charities find themselves relying on a small number of people to make large gifts, and older donors tend to give more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246128">People give for a variety of reasons. While compassion and altruism remain the primary motivation for charitable donations, 23% of Canadians cited the tax credit as an important factor. This is what motivated my private member's motion in the previous Parliament, which was passed unanimously by this House in 2011 and resulted in the finance committee study on tax incentives for charitable donations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246129">The finance committee study reviewed the current tax system and considered changes that could motivate increased giving. By all accounts, this was a very worthwhile exercise. The study brought together charitable organizations, experts and stakeholders and generated a comprehensive discussion about the challenges and opportunities faced by the sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246130">I would like to thank the finance committee members for their excellent work, as well as the witnesses who contributed their expertise and suggestions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246131">I am pleased with the recommendations contained in the report, which focus on tax incentives, transparency, red tape reduction for charitable organizations and public awareness.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246132">I am optimistic that this will lead to real action to benefit our charities and the donors who support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246133">Building on the momentum of this committee study, I am pleased to now have the opportunity to advance an initiative that I believe will continue to raise awareness of Canada's charitable sector and lead to increased support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246134">During the committee study, I was intrigued with the proposal to extend the charitable tax donation deadline. It was suggested that this extension would make it easier for Canadians to donate to the causes that are truly important to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246135">To ascertain the sector's response to such a measure, I held a round table with a number of charities in my riding and consulted with representatives from national charitable organizations. Many felt that this was a common sense idea with great potential. Based on this positive feedback, I proceeded with this initiative and tabled my bill on October 31, 2012. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246136">My private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document>, proposes to extend the deadline for charitable donations by 60 days, so that eligible donations made up until March 1 may be claimed in the previous calendar year. In addition, my bill proposes to establish the last seven days of February as national charities week in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246137">There are a number of reasons I believe this measure will lead to enhanced support for charitable organizations. The current deadline of December 31, as we know, falls during the busy holiday season. At this time, of course, Canadians are not usually focused on strategic financial planning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246138">Further, many charitable organizations are challenged to provide staff during this busy time in order to seize year-end donations and to process receipts. Then when tax time comes in February, people may realize that if they had made a charitable donation, they could have reduced their tax payable and maybe even received a tax refund. Of course, by then it is too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246139">While many Canadians give generously during the holiday season for altruistic reasons, my proposal, I believe, would create a second season of giving in the first 60 days of the year, a period that many charities have told me does not typically see a high level of donation activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246140">In addition, moving the deadline to the tax preparation season in February would provide a motivation to increase giving in order to maximize existing financial tax incentives. It would raise awareness of the charitable tax credit and encourage Canadians to give more prominent consideration to including charitable giving in their financial planning and tax preparation decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246141">My proposal would enable individuals to have a complete picture of their financial situation when considering charitable donations, the same as they currently do with the registered retirement savings plans, or RRSPs. This would benefit the many Canadians who are not salaried employees: small business owners, part-time workers, students and those whose income varies throughout the year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246142">In fact, Canadians who plan their charitable giving tend to give more. According to the 2007 Canadian survey of giving, volunteering and participating, fewer than 20% of donors plan their charitable donations. However, those who do plan their donations give an average of almost $800 annually, compared to $350 for those who do not plan in advance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246143">Other studies have shown that people who build charity into their financial plans are much less likely to decrease their level of giving during an economic downturn. The finance committee's report on tax incentives for charitable giving emphasized the need to raise public awareness in order to promote increased giving and I believe this is what my bill would help to achieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246144">It would also contribute to creating a culture of giving among Canadians that will support and sustain the charitable sector over the long term so that charitable organizations can continue their valuable work in our communities. To further underscore the importance of Canada's charitable sector, national charities week would present charitable organizations with the opportunity to highlight their work and tell their stories, and for all Canadians to celebrate their achievements. Canadians demonstrate their generosity when they see how their donations make a difference in the lives of others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246145">Since introducing my bill last fall, I have received a great deal of positive feedback from across the country, from individual Canadians, charitable organizations, many of my colleagues and the media.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246159">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise on this important debate. I want to say in advance that the official opposition will be in support of the bill. However, it would take it to committee where we think it must be examined before we can sign on entirely to what would at first blush seem to be a fairly straightforward and sensible bill. Let me explain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246160">I salute my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation> for introducing the bill. It has, as he indicated, two separate points. The first is that the Income Tax Act would be amended to provide that charitable gifts, crown gifts, cultural gifts, and ecological gifts made by an individual within 60 days of the end of a taxation year may be deducted from the taxable income of the individual for that taxation year. It would be like, as I understand it, RRSPs, for which there is a later timeline after the taxation year and which can be counted retroactively. That is the first part. The second is to establish a national charities week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246161">There are essentially two issues that need to be addressed, two separate components that need to be taken into account. We need to examine at committee very carefully the impact on federal revenues the bill might have, total charitable giving and the distribution of charitable giving. All must be taken into account if we are to accept this in the House as a positive step. The true cost is very difficult to examine. I will come to that later, but that is what must be taken into account if we are to examine the bill carefully. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246162">As I understand it, the origin of this concept was a recommendation made by tax lawyers Drache Aptowitzer, who appeared before the finance committee in its study of tax incentives for charitable organizations in October 2012. I think my colleague alluded to that. This occurred before I had the honour of serving on the finance committee. I was not there for that report. I will have more to say later about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246163">There have been a lot of challenges facing charities in this country resulting, of course, in part, from the very precarious economic environment facing Canadians during the fiscal crisis of the last couple of years but also, it must be said, based on the attacks on the charitable sector by the Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246164">As the member for Victoria, with a strong environmental presence, I have had numerous constituents come to me and ask what is going on in Ottawa. Why is it that the CRA is targeting charities, requiring in some cases, I am advised, hundreds of thousands of dollars in audit costs because these primarily environmental charities were not well liked by the government. That is a very serious accusation. Yet charitable organizations are suffering not only under that concern but also from an increase in red tape, which is ironic, because that was one of the key recommendations of the report on charities alluded to by my colleague. I will have more to say about that in a moment as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246165">In order to understand the first element of this, which is the creation of a week, as I understand it, at the end of February to salute charities, we need to take into account that there have already been other statutes proposed and enacted to deal with the charitable sector. For example, there was Bill <Document DbId="5369841" Type="4">C-399</Document> on a tax credit for volunteers, Bill <Document DbId="5081662" Type="4">S-201</Document> to create a national philanthropy day, tax incentives for a charitable donation study, which the finance committee has undertaken, and so forth and so on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246166">The context needs to be understood. Is it going to add value to have such a week to salute our charities in light of that reality? That needs to be understood. Again, it is something a committee could look at more carefully. We recommended and support this initiative so that a committee can look at it in the context I have just described.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246167">The government's approach seems to find ways to increasingly transfer what we used to think of as government responsibilities to the private sector. Charities, in short, are often required by the government to take up the slack in what used to be governmental activities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246168">In my community, we have The Mustard Seed and Our Place. There are innumerable food banks from coast to coast to coast. These charities are doing what many Canadians think is the responsibility of the government. That is something that is increasingly a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246169">No less an authority than the Fraser Institute has indicated that Canadians give only about half as much as our American friends do to charities. Perhaps we are taxed more. Perhaps we are less generous people. I do not know. My friend has indicated that the donor base is in fact going down. Therefore, we need to understand the implications of the second part of the bill in an already quite fragile situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246170">I indicated that the government on the one hand is encouraging Canadians to give more. At the same time, it is taking away essential public services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246171">I want to go to the place the bill originated, which was with the recommendations of the law firm Drache Aptowitzer. I looked at some of the writings they have posted on their website to try to understand where the bill would fit. Sadly, they report that the Conservative government is making charitable donations even more difficult for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246172">In an article called “T3010: Mounting Complexity for Charities”, they report that it is getting harder and harder, despite recommendations to the contrary. The breadth of information now required, they state, is enormous. They give a list of forms and information charities are required to provide that is astounding. A booklet of 40 pages in length is provided. There is form T3010, the registered charity information return; form TF725, the registered charity basic information sheet; the financial statements of the charities; and the directors/trustees and like officials worksheet. There are pages of schedules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246173">What they say, the same people who have recommended this 60-day period, which is the second phase of the bill, is that we now have schedule 7, another form, and that “this has to do with political activity which of course is a hot topic for government”. They continue that in the 2012 budget “there were several announcements about third party political funding and in particular, funding from outside Canada”, and the author states: “How dare those Americans meddle in a Canadian environmental issue!” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246174">They say that the request for information would be very difficult to comply with and point out that a lot of expensive audits would be required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246175">The official opposition is concerned about the way charities have been targeted if they are not popular with the government. That is something I am hearing daily in my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246176">Imagine Canada and the charitable organizations it represents have a lot of mixed feelings about Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document>. They like the concept, but like us, they are very concerned about the administration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246177">The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants has said that by extending the deadline date by 60 days, from December 31 to the end of February, there will be administrative issues that will create concerns, namely the provision of receipts from the charities to donors to meet the deadline dates for personal tax returns, April 30, and trust returns, March 31.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246178">The Canadian Bar Association, of which I am a proud member, has expressed similar concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246179">The costs are hard to imagine and hard to estimate. Would it result in an increase in personal donations? Perhaps. One would hope so. However, we need to examine carefully the real cost of this initiative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246180">The NDP will be supporting the bill so that it can be examined with the care it deserves at the finance committee or at the appropriate committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246181">With that, I would just like to say that on the one hand the Conservatives are claiming to be helping charitable organizations, but on the other hand often cutting funding for those charities and making it more difficult with their red tape for them to continue to make the contribution they make to our society.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246182">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document>, which my Liberal colleagues and I will be supporting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246183">Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> proposes the establishment of a national charities week at the end of February, in order to showcase and celebrate the work of Canada's charitable organizations. Canada's broader not-for-profit sector is as diverse as Canada itself. Charities are wide-ranging in focus and in scope, working on issues as varied as medical research, children's rights and heritage preservation. From food banks to hospitals to synagogues to theatres, Canada's charities make a difference in communities across the country. They do great work and they deserve our support. They certainly have the country's support, for there is no doubt that Canadians are generous, compassionate and community-minded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246184">According to the 2010 Canada survey of giving, volunteering and participating, nearly half of Canadians aged 15 and over volunteer. All together, they give 2.1 billion hours of their time to charities and not-for-profits; 84% give financially, contributing an average of $446. People of all ages share in this effort, from youth, who are the most likely to volunteer, to seniors, who give more hours and more money than any other cohort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246185">Canadians who give to charity can and should take advantage of the tax relief available to them. However, not all donors claim tax credits for their donations. At the moment, the most generous donors and the donors most likely to claim tax credits are those who give on a regular basis and who plan their giving in advance, which leads us to the crux of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246186">To give one example, monthly donors to Girl Guides of Canada make sure they get income tax receipts. Those of us who buy and enjoy the cookies every spring and autumn do not. The number of people who give in this way is declining. By establishing a national charities week, however, we can work with the not-for-profit sector to encourage Canadians to practise planned giving and to make them more aware of charitable donation tax credits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246187">Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> also proposes amending the Income Tax Act so that taxpayers can claim a tax credit for gifts made during a calendar year and during the first 60 days of the following year. In effect, the deadline for eligible charitable donations would coincide with both the national charities week and the deadline for registered retirement savings plan contributions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246188">In their earlier submission to the Standing Committee on Finance, Mr. Drache and Mr. Aptowitzer made a similar proposal that suggested such a move. They said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246189">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This would allow donors to make decisions when completely informed of their tax situation for the previous year. It would also allow charities and donors to focus on the tax aspects of giving and increase the opportunities for educating taxpayers on the tax incentive of donating.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246190">During his testimony to committee on February 9, 2011, Mr. Aptowitzer stressed that moving the deadline to February would give charities the opportunity to campaign and to get donors to think about charitable giving in the tax context, which is something that the committee talked about as being a new thing for the tax code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246191">While it is true that Canadians associate the end of February with the tax preparation and the RRSP deadline, we should note that the parallel between RRSP contributions and charitable donations is not exact. They both reduce taxable income, but Canadians who contribute to an RRSP are also putting money toward their own retirement. Essentially, they are paying themselves. It is important that we bear that difference in mind and not assume that Canadians will start thinking about charitable giving in the same way that they think about their RRSPs. That said, there is no doubt that the considerable efforts made to educate Canadians about the tax aspects of RRSP contributions have led more people to contribute to their RRSPs and that making the same effort on behalf of charitable donations could have a decided impact.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246192">There are certain issues that a committee study would need to address. In particular, we would need to hear from charities and non-profit organizations about how the proposed changes to the tax deadline might affect their fundraising strategies and annual cycles of donations. Currently, the tax deadline coincides with the end of the winter holiday giving season. Many charities base major fundraising campaigns around the December holidays. They are the experts on what works and what resources they have available and we should take our consultations with them very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246193">It should also be noted that the fiscal impact of Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> is still unclear since it will be largely dependent on donor behaviour. At the moment, donation tax credits for individuals costs the federal treasury approximately $2.4 billion per year. If the bill's outreach measures are as successful as we hope they will be and more Canadians claim the charitable tax donation tax credit, that figure will rise. A committee study should include detailed modelling so that parliamentarians have an accurate idea of how much Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> would cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246194">While it raises some questions that would need to be answered at the finance committee, Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> provides Canadians with an opportunity to celebrate their charitable sector and educate each other about charitable giving. I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation> for introducing the bill and invite all members to join me and the Liberal Party in supporting it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246195">On the point of charitable giving, I personally am from the most charitable province of all, Newfoundland and Labrador. I do not mean to play favourites, but nonetheless it is a bragging point for a small province such as we are. I like to think that on all occasions we punch above our weight, certainly when it comes to charitable donations. Our volunteer base is incredibly large for our small communities. In my riding alone there are over 198 communities. There are well over 800 communities in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador alone. Many smaller remote communities in both areas, on the island and the mainland of Labrador, benefit from charitable donations, not just financially but also in volunteer hours spent at bake sales and dinners in these areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246196">Our most treasured volunteer groups in the province would be the volunteer firefighters and the volunteer search and rescue. These people spend an incredible amount of hours involved in raising money, keeping our communities safe and in many ways allowing our communities to thrive. Our children have activities and get involved in their communities based on what inspires them, and what inspires them are the people who give hours to their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246197">All of that would not be possible if it was not for the generosity of many individual Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. Many companies and businesses give an incredible amount of money to their local communities, whether it be for local festivals or a fundraiser for a person who needs help for health reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246198">I have been to several fundraisers in my riding and throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, as my colleagues from <Affiliation DbId="170758" Type="2">Random—Burin—St. George's</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="170649" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> can attest to. They have been to many fundraisers where certain people need help, whether it be for health reasons or to get somewhere for some sporting event. We do this all the time. It is inbred within us to give, as our children will give and our parents give. This bill is the type of measure that allows better contributions. It allows people and companies to give and financially plan better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246199">Therefore, as a party we support the bill for all the reasons mentioned, such as the planning aspect and the end of year coinciding with RRSP contributions. I would advise the committee to consider how they would publicize this tax credit in order to take full advantage of it. Whether it is the biggest city or the smallest community, this definitely is of benefit to not only the small communities but the volunteers who give and make it worthwhile.</ParaText>

I will support this bill at second reading and I hope all members on both sides of the House do the same. It has certainly received some positive support in the speeches I have heard thus far, which I also appreciate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246201">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation> pointed out, the bill would establish the last seven days of February as national charities week and would extend the tax deadline to claim charitable donations from December 31 to the end of March, matching the deadline for RRSP contributions. The member's objective is obviously quite noble, seeking to encourage a greater number of Canadians to give more generously to charities, supporting these organizations in their valuable work both in Canada and around the world. As chair of the finance committee, I hope and fully expect that Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> will be supported by all parties and I look forward to further discussion and analysis of this proposal, including hearing from the member and from a wide range of groups in the charitable sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246202">However, before I speak directly to the legislation before the House today, I will take an opportunity, as his colleague, to recognize the member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation> for his truly outstanding record in support of the charitable sector since first being elected in 2008. In 2010, he sponsored Motion No. 559, which called for the Standing Committee on Finance to study tax incentives for charitable donations, a motion that was supported by all parties. Having a colleague supported by all parties is quite unique in the House. I am very happy to report that after extensive work last year and into early this year, the finance committee completed that important study, and I encourage all parliamentarians and Canadians to view that study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246203">As chair of the committee, I can tell the House that we heard important evidence showing the need for the government to help foster and promote a culture of giving. Not only that, but we learned that tax incentives had a definite role to play in increasing the number of new donors and encouraging existing donors to give even more. I am pleased to report that the committee's study brought attention to the importance of charitable giving. I am confident it will help inform the government's further action to support charities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246204">With this outcome, we can all agree that the member's contributions to date have truly been invaluable. His reputation in this regard is well known. Imagine Canada, the leading umbrella organization representing Canadian charities, has praised the member's willingness to consult with it on new ideas, saying, “[The member] has been and continues to be a real champion for the charitable sector...He demonstrates a sound understanding of the issues we’re facing”. I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the House will agree with that assessment and will join our government in sending the bill to the finance committee for the hearing that it deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246205">In supporting this proposal to committee, a proposal which was raised during the previous study which I mentioned, we can ensure that it will be carefully considered by both parliamentarians and charities alike. At committee, we can answer the questions that have been raised by members during this debate today. We can conduct a thorough examination of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246206"> An important consideration is how this proposal will be effective in encouraging Canadians to increase their donations. A study at the finance committee will help us to determine to what degree a later deadline for annual contributions will impact donations and at what cost. We will also hear from charities about the potential impact of a March 1 deadline on their ability to deliver important services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246207"> Currently, organizations have about six to eight weeks following the end of the year to get tax receipts to donors for early filing. If the deadline were to be moved 12 weeks later, charities would obviously have to make the necessary administrative adjustments. However, the most important reason for members to vote to send the bill to committee is that charities could share their views on this important bill and on this topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246208">On the larger issues of charities, which I want to address and which some other members have spoken about today, I emphasize that our Conservative government fully supports the important work of charities to improve the lives of Canadians who rely on their support. Each and every day, selfless and remarkable volunteers make a difference in lives all across the country without expecting anything in return. In fact, there are over 160,000 Canadian charities and non-profit organizations that support worthwhile causes in our communities. That is an amazing number, of which all members should be proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246209"> That is why our government is committed to the charitable sector and we have continuously strengthened that commitment, including successive actions to improve tax incentives for donations. I will remind members of a few of these actions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246220">Mr. Speaker, naturally, we are going to support Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> since it is well-intentioned and the NDP supports the charitable sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246221">Nevertheless, I would like to say that the Conservatives' rhetoric is causing confusion. On the one hand, they claim to support charitable organizations, but on the other, they are cutting funding for such organizations and constantly attacking them. There is every reason to believe that the government's approach to the charitable sector is to gradually transfer its responsibility toward Canadians to the private sector. I would like to remind the government that it is and must remain responsible for, among other things, essential public services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246222">Now, I will explain the two main components of this bill. First, this bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act by extending by 60 days following the end of a taxation year the period during which people would be eligible for a tax credit for donations made to charities for that same tax year. Second, the bill seeks to establish a national charities week during the last week of February.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246223">We support this bill in order to send it to committee. There, we will try to make the changes necessary to make it into a financially responsible bill that meets the needs of Canadian workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246224">For the moment, the financial cost estimates are based only on hypotheses about how people will react to the extension of the tax credit deadline. I do not think that is good enough, and I think we could do much better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246225">The Standing Committee on Finance needs to have a more specific idea of the cost of such a measure and it needs to know that this bill is an appropriate response to the problems faced by charitable organizations. We also do not have any evidence to show that a national charities week in February would really benefit this sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246226">Many charitable organizations also expressed concerns that were mainly administrative in nature. They intend to raise these issues when the bill goes to committee. They are also of the opinion that the bill could help to solve this sector's problems but that it is certainly not the be-all and end-all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246227">Efforts to increase charitable donations are commendable and we support them. However, we also have to ensure that an in-depth analysis is conducted of the impact this bill would have on federal revenues, as well as on the total amount of donations and their distribution. That being said, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about some of the most fundamental aspects of this bill and the Canadian tax system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246228">Although charity work is important, the government's actions are as well. A lot of churches and other shelters for the homeless, run by the private sector, keep people from freezing to death on the street, but governments here and elsewhere in the world have found that the only long-term solution is affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246229">Cancer research centres can be managed privately, but some of the best research comes out of publicly funded universities and hospitals. Yes, it is important to ensure that charities can continue to function, but when the government abandons its responsibilities toward vulnerable groups by delegating those responsibilities to the charitable sector, damage can be significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246230">People who count on systems that the government puts in place may not find the private sector alternative right away. When the government behaves this way, it hurts the people directly affected by government assistance and communities as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246231">Furthermore, if the government tries to make the legislation work through the tax system, it could end up abandoning the less fortunate. Often, the government's special tax exemptions are given only to individuals who are well off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246232">This does not mean that they do not need it—far from it—and we must continue to work at lowering the cost of living for everyone. However, all I am saying is that a single mother with three children who earns $23,000 a year needs more help than a family with two people earning $50,000 each. Up until now, the government has chosen to ignore the single mother.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246233">In 2009, 33.4% of Canadians did not pay taxes. They therefore could not benefit from the government's many attempts to legislate through taxes. Critics consider them lucky, but these are seniors living below the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246234">These are students who cannot eat balanced meals because they do not have enough money left over after paying for books and tuition. These are the least fortunate who work for minimum wage or even less if they work in the service industry. If they have children, their expenses double or triple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246235">When the government promises tax breaks, all these people hear is that they will receive fewer resources from this government. In many cases, the least fortunate are not informed of the tax breaks offered by the government and they obviously do not get an accountant to fill out their tax returns. It is not complicated. Even if they pay taxes and are entitled to exemptions, these people often do not have the knowledge or expertise to take advantage of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246236">Some will say that these people should simply go to an accountant, but if the single mother of three I mentioned earlier can save $60 by filling out her tax return on her own, so she can buy groceries for her kids, it is obvious which choice she will make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246237">We need to be realistic. This government has used targeted tax exemptions to solidify its slim support in ridings across the country as it saw fit. It did so with little regard for those most in need, and with even less regard for a balanced budget for the country. Another year goes by with another deficit and another round of cuts to social programs, jobs and employment insurance benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246238">This government has a bad habit of saying that it helps charitable organizations, but then cuts their funding and attacks organizations that defend positions that are not in keeping with the government's policies. Take Rights and Democracy, for example. The government decided to put an end to that non-governmental rights group, which had gained worldwide clout and an international reputation since its creation in 1988. The Conservatives interfered politically and appointed people who defended the Conservative ideology within the organization. At the time, dozens of public servants denounced the Conservatives' political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246239">That is how the government works. When an organization refutes its ideology, it simply cuts that organization off. If no specific organization is in the crosshairs, the government simply slashes international development aid, as it did in the last budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246240">Although we support the charitable sector, we deplore the Conservative government's lack of long-term vision for the sector. This sector needs a comprehensive, coherent, long-term policy. Expecting the charitable sector to become an alternative to essential government services is completely absurd. Organizations working in this area should not replace government in offering services to the people. If that is the case, then that does not bode well for the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246241">If we want to avoid an explosion in demand for charitable services, the government simply needs to do its job and maintain and invest in social programs. We will support this bill at second reading so that it can be examined more closely in committee. It is important to support the charitable sector in Canada as part of a long-term vision and without losing sight of the government's responsibilities towards the public.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246244">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of my constituents in the Alberta riding of Crowfoot to participate in the private member's debate brought forward by my colleague, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246245">First, I would start by saying that the Good Book says that it is more blessed to give than to receive. For all members of Parliament from all sides, as we look around our constituencies at the various charitable organizations that are volunteering their time and are doing everything they can to support good causes, we want to thank them. We also agree that there is a satisfaction, a feeling of being blessed, when we can be part of that and give in a charitable way. Anything we can do to help enhance that type of giving is to be commended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246246">Therefore, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation>. I had some questions about Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> initially and I sat down here in the House with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation>. I understood that this was a member who had a passion for charitable organizations and for trying to do the right thing. There is no hidden agenda here. It is simply a question of how he can better move charitable organizations forward so that people can be part of that blessing, so to speak, of being able to give and to donate to these good causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246247">In that stand, he has introduced Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document>, which proposes mainly two changes. The first change would create a national charities week in the last week of February each year. My colleague also wants to amend Canada's Income Tax Act. He would extend the deadline for people claiming charitable gifts for tax purposes from December 31 of the taxation year to 60 days after that to match the deadline for contributions for RRSPs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246248">This is an admirable attempt to help Canadians contribute to those less fortunate. All members of the House want to commend our colleague for bringing these two ideas to debate here in the House of Commons. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170367" Type="2">Kitchener—Waterloo</Affiliation>, as it has already been stated, is earning quite a reputation for himself and his constituents as being one who cares about charities. We congratulate him and recognize that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246249">Previously, his private member's Motion No. 559 prompted a study by the House of Commons finance committee, which brought major attention to the needs of charities. In turn, his motion prompted a national conversation about the good work of these organizations in Canada. The committee's subsequent work report will no doubt inform the government's future action on support for those charities, potentially as soon as the upcoming budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246250">I can say to my constituents and to all Canadians listening to this debate that our Conservative government understands the value of the selfless work of charities and of the volunteers that make them successful. I see the value of this work in my constituency. It is remarkable to see the generosity and hard work of many churches, youth groups, schools, seniors groups and local organizations in my riding. I take this opportunity to commend all of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246251">I am invited to many charitable events and fundraisers throughout the year in my riding. As a former businessman who owned an auction company and was an auctioneer, I am able to be the auctioneer for some of these events. I tell all of the charities in my riding that nobody wants to hear my speech, but they all want me to come and do the auction sale for them. Through this work, I have the opportunity to meet with many key people in the community, both in the volunteer sector and those who contribute through their finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246252">Bill <Document DbId="5794262" Type="4">C-458</Document> has some potential to increase the incentives that already exist for Canadians to give money generously to charities. It would facilitate even more good work in communities here in Canada and around the world. That is why it is important for the bill to be studied closely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246253">Canadians support the House engaging in a full assessment of the implications of the bill. We will be paying close attention to what stakeholders and those involved in carrying out our charitable work have to say. As my colleagues have noted, Canada already has one of the most generous systems of tax support for charitable donations in the world. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3246254">Our Conservative government has already introduced several measures in recent years to enhance incentives for donations. We have taken action to improve transparency and accountability in the charitable sector, including through measures announced in economic action plan 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246255">I want to thank the member for bringing this bill forward. A study in the House of Commons would be a very positive thing, and I look forward to the bill passing.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246259">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have taken so much money from the employment insurance fund in the past that we are no longer able to provide benefits to workers all year round. In order to make up for the lack of money and competence, the Liberals brought in pilot projects in an attempt to cover the black hole that appears in the spring. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246260">The Conservatives are now eliminating this vital program. Additional weeks of employment insurance benefits are designed to help seasonal workers make ends meet before the work season starts. Otherwise, they end up in a black hole of several weeks without income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246261">The pilot project must continue. It is shameful for a government to leave thousands of workers in poverty. It is even more shameful on the part of the Conservatives because they have not learned from past mistakes when the Liberals tried to bring in EI reforms in the 1990s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246262">In the long term, we need a real reform that will actually meet the needs of workers. After all, employment insurance belongs to the workers and to employers. It is time to stop taking away what is rightfully theirs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246263">The minister must understand that her reform is having direct, serious consequences on thousands of workers and employers. She would know this if she had asked for impact studies before pushing ahead with a reform that is so out of touch with reality. However, the minister refuses to listen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246264">When representatives of the entire eastern Quebec region went to her to explain how her reform will affect them, she called the evidence given by representatives of the Coalition de l'Est myths. As they say, there are none so deaf as those who will not hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246265">The employment insurance reform is having serious consequences, but the minister continues to call those consequences myths. It is not a myth when thousands of people are all saying that this reform is hurting them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246266">However, what is a myth is the minister's assertion that inspectors do not have a quota, when we now know that they are all supposed to cut nearly $500,000 each in benefits per year. The minister should be able to distinguish something that is a myth from something that is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246267">Clearly, real studies and real consultations are needed before any reforms are made to something as important as employment insurance. However, the minister recently admitted that no impact studies were conducted. She said simply that some analyses were done, but we know nothing about those analyses. We cannot be sure of anything in terms of what those analyses were based on. Once again, the government is working in the dark. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246268">How can such major changes be made without any studies? Will the minister make those analyses public, so we can see what she based her reform on?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246269">Mr. Speaker, I think the question we had on the order paper tonight was about Parks Canada, but I am always happy to talk about job growth and creation in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246270">On my colleague's question and point, first, with regard to the EI reforms that our government has made, they have been made with one key principle in mind, and that is the sustainability of the program, to ensure it is there for the future for those who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246271">My colleague spoke a lot about jobs and job creation. It is always a wonderful opportunity to speak about our government's jobs and growth record. I believe the figure, which we can be very proud of, is that our government has seen the creation of over 900,000 net new jobs in the country since we have taken office and since the turn of the economy in the country. That is a record that we can be proud of not only at home but, comparatively speaking, internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246272">Our country is one where we have seen economic growth, month over month, quarter over quarter, slow, steady, predictable growth because of the way our economy has been managed and because of our focus on ensuring prosperity in all industrial sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246273">To be able to speak in the House to ensuring jobs growth is a wonderful thing. It is also timely given the fact, and again because environment was on the order paper and it is a subject I love to speak to, of the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s recent trip to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246274">He spoke today at length in question period about value-added jobs. I wish I would have had the opportunity to stand and ask him what he would say to the value-added workers in the oil sands sector, the manufacturing sector and the finance sector and if he would try to explain to them why he would potentially advocate against energy infrastructure for our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246275">We talk about jobs. We talk about employment insurance. To educate the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> just a touch on how the energy sector works, we need energy infrastructure to get our product to other markets. To lobby against projects so openly, I have to wonder how the members in his party can get up and talk about employment insurance, job creation and all these things when he is lobbying against a key project that would create job growth and prosperity for all the country in an environmentally responsible manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246276">Our government has been so focused on asking how we can ensure that our environmental assessment process is robust, how we can ensure that the build out of these projects are environmentally sustainable and how we can ensure that our economy is sustainable long into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246277">The energy sector plays such a key part of that. If we are to talk about employment insurance reform, how can my colleague even bring this up when his leader cannot even make up his mind. He came to my city of Calgary and said that he would not speak against the energy sector and then he did that very thing in Washington the next week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246278">There needs to be clarity from the NDP on what its job policy is. To me it says that it does not value people in the energy sector and it does not value people who create growth through that sector. This is something the NDP should be a little more clear about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246279">We were supposed to be talking about Parks Canada tonight according to the order paper. It is always a good opportunity to talk about how our government has actually increased the amount of protected park land in our country by over 50%. It is something we should be cognizant of: jobs, growth and economic prosperity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246281">I appreciate her answer. I will point out that in my riding, in the Gaspésie, we have been blessed with both natural resources and a series of public parks and we also have issues with employment and employment insurance. We need to find a proper balance between all of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246282">We have a problem with unemployment in Parks Canada in my riding. Services have been cut dramatically. We are back to the problem where even Parks Canada is an employment issue in my riding. We need to develop the economy and have the proper support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246283">When we created Forillon National Park, we had a plan. Again five years ago, we had yet another confirmation of the plan to bring forward the economy and how we would develop the park to be an economic engine in the riding. We seem to have now abandoned that plan entirely.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246285">Mr. Speaker, I accept my colleague's challenge to change or stretch my debate skills tonight on parks and employment insurance. First, with regard to Forillon National Park, the member knows it has been our government that has actually invested millions of dollars into infrastructure for that park specifically. I should have him note too that if he checks the record of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development, when we looked at the last estimates, officials spoke about how year over year it had been our government that invested more into parks than when we took office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246286">We try to ensure that our visitor experience of people in our national park is exceptional, that the ecological integrity component of Parks Canada mandate is also exceptional and that we do this while we expand the amount of protective space in the country. We have done that in the context of creating jobs and growth for all Canadians. It is always a good thing when we can tell Canadians there are future employment prospects for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246287">Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in adjournment proceedings to follow up on a question I initially asked on November 30, 2012. That question related to the Canada-China investment treaty, but was much more specifically directed to the concerns that were growing not just in Canada, but around the world about the process of arbitration resolution to disputes that existed between so-called investors or transnational corporations and states, meaning governments around the world. Investor state agreements have proliferated since the first one, which was part of NAFTA, chapter 11.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246288">What I tried to shine a light on in my question was unfortunately missed in the response that came from the hon. <Affiliation DbId="170841" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>. What I was trying to talk about was the problem of global ambulance chasers, an elite within global law firms that represent corporations in suits against nations and drum up the business. They go to countries and say that they think they can sue over a new environmental law that country X just brought in and they can help make that happen. Even if the country where it is based does not have investment business in the country where they could sue, they tell it open an office over there and then it can sue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246289">This was all brought to light as I referred in my question in a report called “Profiting from Injustice. How law firms, arbitrators and financiers are fuelling an investment arbitration boom”. This is a very important aspect of the pending Canada-China investment treaty. The cabinet of this country has the authority, without a vote in the House of Commons, to approve a treaty that would bind Canada for 31 years. Under the terms of that treaty, should a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China find one of our laws to be impinging on its expectation of profit, it can go to arbitrators. This is not a court, not a lawsuit in the typical sense. This is appealing to an arbitration in which three powerful lawyers from this elite group of global ambulance chasers will hear both sides and make a determination for which there is no appeal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246290">In the course of my question on November 30, I pointed out that this report from Europe blew a hole through the idea that arbitration was impartial and unbiased. In fact, these lawyers, who are working at $1,000 an hour, are part of the same law firms that encourage governments to enter into these treaties and then profit from the arbitrations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246291">Just to give a sense of this, 15 arbitrators from Europe, Canada and the U.S. have settled 55% of the cases. One of these arbitrators, Juan Fernández-Armesto, an arbitrator from Spain, said:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246292">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign states have agreed to investment arbitration at all...Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246293">In other words, this process of arbitration to which we will be binding ourselves in the Canada-China investment treaty puts us at the whim of three elite lawyers who are part of a club that is generating millions from legal fees. Countries like the Philippines have had to spend tens of millions of dollars to defend themselves from lawsuits from cigarette companies. We must stop our blind assurances that investment treaties hold no threats for us and really look at whether arbitrations are impartial.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3246294">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to the question posed on November 30 by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> regarding foreign investment. While she has been talking to one very specific point, my answer is part of a much broader context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246295">First, I would like to reaffirm this government's commitment to welcoming foreign investment that benefits Canada. The fact is that foreign investment is crucial to the Canadian economy and the prosperity of Canada. It introduces new technologies and practices that promote growth, employment and innovation here at home. Foreign investment brings some of the most productive and specialized firms in the world to Canada and results in some of the highest paying jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246296">This government also recognizes that Canadian businesses must compete in a globalized economy, and we are committed to creating the right conditions for Canadian business to succeed internationally. Canada has signed foreign investment promotion and protection agreements, or FIPAs, with numerous countries, which helps connect our firms to the rest of the world and creates a stable, secure environment for two-way investment between Canada and other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246297">FIPAs accomplish their objectives by setting out the respective rights and obligations of the countries that are signatories to the treaty with respect to the treatment of foreign investment. FIPAs seek to ensure that foreign investors will not be treated worse than similarly situated domestic investors or other foreign investors. They will not have their investments expropriated without prompt and adequate compensation, and in any case, they will not be subject to treatment lower than the minimum standards established in customary international law. As well, in most circumstances, investors should be free to invest capital and repatriate their investments and returns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246298">We will continue our work to secure access to foreign markets in order to ensure the success of our own Canadian businesses abroad. Most recently, Canada entered into a FIPA with China. The agreement will be tabled in the House of Commons pursuant to the government's treaty tabling policy. It will then come into force once the order in council has been approved by the Governor General of Canada and the ratification process in the People's Republic of China has been completed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246299">With respect to foreign investments, our government has a sound process in place to ensure they benefit Canadians. We have made targeted amendments to the Investment Canada Act that provide greater transparency to the public, more flexibility in enforcement and an alternative to costly and time-consuming litigation. As well, in December, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced clarifications related to state-owned enterprises to ensure our foreign investment review processes continue to carefully examine investments to ensure they are of benefit to Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246301"> Not only are foreign investors treated as well as domestic investors under this particular type of perverse treaty, foreign investors are treated way better. There is not a domestic company that could sue the Parliament of Canada because we passed a law it did not like. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246302">That is what Ethyl Corporation of Richmond, Virginia did when it did not like a law passed by the Parliament of Canada to restrict the exposure of Canadians to a manganese-based gasoline additive that causes neurotoxic health effects in people. If it had been manufactured in Canada, that particular company would have been out of luck. Because it was a foreign corporation and had benefit of chapter 11 of NAFTA, it could sue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246303">Not only that, we do not need investor state agreements to open markets or to get investment. Examine Australia, it is a perfect case. It has 10 times more investment from China than Canada. The Australians are at over $600 million in investments from China, but they have refused to sign an investment treaty because they have decided, with a cost-benefit analysis, that such a treaty could create more cost and more damages than benefits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246304">Mr. Speaker, often from the other side we hear of their opposition to these free trade agreements we are making. Under this government, Canada is open for business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246305">We will continue to provide an economic climate that allows Canadian firms to prosper. To that end, we welcome foreign investment that provides net benefit for Canadians and helps grow the economy. We will not go down the path of protectionism. Canada cannot afford to fall behind. Instead, this government will take a responsible approach to foreign investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246306">The recent foreign investment promotion and protection agreement that was entered into with China will help protect Canadians investing in China, and lead to jobs and economic growth here in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246307">Mr. Speaker, when I spoke in question period on February 7, I shared with the House a major concern that many stakeholders have with regard to the government's current strategy for oil exploration and development in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This is a valid concern that is shared by the Commissioner of the Environment in his most recent report dated February 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246308">Right now, the people of the Magdalen Islands and eastern Quebec are worried about the serious environmental impact of developing the Old Harry prospect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246309">As things now stand, a spill could wipe out the regional economy of the islands in one fell swoop and cause considerable damage to both the environment and the area's seasonal economy, which is mainly based on the fishery and tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246310">The Commissioner of the Environment's report is damning in terms of the lack of consultation and the absence of a mandate for stakeholders who would have a role to play in the event of an environmental disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246311"> The report confirmed that there are gaps in the risk assessments and that, at present, no one is prepared to respond to an oil spill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246312">Bernard Richard, former New Brunswick ombudsman, also expressed serious concerns about the Old Harry project. With regard to what we learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, he said that, although we seemed to have learned a lot, we also seem to quickly forget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246313"> Commissioner Scott Vaughan's report is clear. He states that the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board has not obtained adequate assurance that operators are ready to respond effectively to a spill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246314">In light of the most recent report, and also the unanimous request made by the National Assembly of Quebec in 2010, the federal government, the Government of Newfoundland and the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board are being asked to wait for the results of strategic environmental assessments requested by the Government of Quebec before issuing any drilling and seismic testing permits for Old Harry and to suspend existing permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246315">The government must stop shirking its responsibilities and impose a moratorium on the development of Old Harry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246316">It is one of the largest and most productive marine ecosystems in the world. It is also of great economic significance as it is used extensively for fishing and recreational activities, as well as being an important shipping route.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246317">We also learned in Scott Vaughan's report that the Canadian liability limits in the offshore oil and gas sector are totally archaic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246318">For example, if an accident were to occur in the Atlantic, the penalty would be $30 million. The public, not the oil companies, will assume the risks of offshore development with their tax dollars and also because environmental impacts will affect coastal ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246319">We recently learned that public consultations on the Old Harry project that were to be held by New Brunswick were quietly abandoned. Environmental experts in all areas are criticizing the way in which the government is managing the development of offshore oil in the Old Harry sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246320">The request is coming from the Government of Quebec and our party. We are asking the government to impose a moratorium on any current development and exploration until things have been clarified and the concerns expressed by the commissioner have been addressed by the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246321">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member opposite for providing me with the opportunity to share with the House the environmental review process for the Old Harry project in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246322">It is important that we take a look at the facts and not at fearmongering. As members know, Canada has very strong environmental laws and standards. We have a robust safety regime and experienced independent offshore regulators. Oil and gas rigs in Canada's offshore, including equipment and operator training, must meet strict standards that are among the highest in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246323">We recognize the importance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to all Canadians and understand that some stakeholders have very legitimate concerns about environmental sensitivities in this region. Many Canadians have an interest in oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and its potential impact on the five surrounding provinces. That is why we rely on arm's-length independent regulatory bodies to make science-based decisions on development in Canada's offshore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246324">The 2005 strategic environmental assessment for western Newfoundland and Labrador is currently being updated, and consultations have been held in all five provinces. The strategic environmental assessment update seeks to ensure that any drilling in the gulf will be safe for the environment and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246325">The assessment by the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board is an important step to ensure that the safety of the environment will be protected. I want to assure all members that Canadian regulators will not allow any offshore activity to take place unless they are convinced that the environment will be fully protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246326">As we know, the Old Harry project is currently on hold. Last January, Corridor Resources requested a prohibition order by the board until a strategic environmental assessment of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246327">In summary, the strategic environmental assessment of the gulf is going forward as planned. That means we have an independent regulatory body that is doing its job in the best interests of Canadians. The environmental assessment of Old Harry is on track, and the project will not proceed until we are convinced that the environment of the gulf coast will be protected. That is the bottom line.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3246328">Mr. Speaker, experts at Environment Canada found a number of errors in the scenario Corridor Resources developed to predict the effects of an oil spill as part of its exploratory drilling plans at Old Harry, in the middle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. According to the documents submitted by the oil company, its impact study determined that the effects of an oil spill would be very limited and would last less than 24 hours. Any respectable expert would find this scenario laughable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246329">The work was not done properly. It is clear that the Canadian government is completely incapable of getting all those who would be involved in controlling the spill to agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246330">In the absence of any strategy from our government and in the absence of a credible scenario that would show that the government is in control, we are calling for and hope to obtain a moratorium until a full environmental assessment in Quebec is complete and the government has assured the public that there will be appropriate intervention.</ParaText>

That is precisely why we have environmental assessments: to ensure that politics do not colour the conclusions of the report. That is why it is independent and why our government waits until hearing from experts before making a decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246332">I have noticed this same proclivity to judge before hearing the facts is apparent across the way. Instead, we often hear opposition members say that they know the facts better than the scientists, that they know environmental effects better than the experts and that they know the economics of projects better than economists and businesses. It is this disregard for any scientific review of projects that I find very dangerous coming from the opposition benches. I recommend that the member opposite wait and listen to the conclusions of the independent scientific reviews. It is what our government is doing and it is the responsible approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3246333">I repeat that this project will be reviewed by an independent group of experts. We look forward to reviewing that report before making a decision, and I hope that the member opposite will do the same.</ParaText>
