Therefore, the petitioners ask, in the spirit of global solidarity, for the government to grant the full funding of $49.2 million over five years to the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace. </ParaText>

This is based on a news report that came out. They are really concerned that terminating pregnancies because of the gender of the fetus is the worst kind of discrimination against girls. There is a growing practice in the country of people getting ultrasounds to determine the sex of their child, and then, if it is not the gender they want, they are terminating that pregnancy. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247559">Mr. Speaker, this arises out of a point of order that was raised last Friday. The government House leader chose to enter the debate earlier this week. I notified the Speaker then that we would take some reflection on what happened on Friday over the course of question period and respond as soon as we could, which is now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247560">I spent some time looking at and listening to what transpired on Friday during question period and I looked through the blues. There are two central and salient points of the conversation that may aid the Speaker's office, if there is a ruling forthcoming. I am not sure what the Speaker's views are on this right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247561">One aspect of this debate on which I agree with the government is the usage of the terms around calling a minister to account and how it is that we, in question period, pose our questions and use the terms “minister responsible for” or “the minister of”, which are proper titles given to ministers. We normally associate that title to their official title. Sometimes that title has a couple of variations, but we attempt in our questioning to adhere to the specific title given to the minister. We think insults or particular impugning of their reputation in that title is inappropriate. We have tried to guide our members in that direction. However, sometimes, either in French or English, that can become a bit murky. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247562">The second point is more a point of interpretation as to what happened on Friday, when some members of the government took offence. When I read the transcript in French and in English, there may have been problems, or interpretations of the interpretation, if you will, Mr. Speaker. Over the course of that question period, we can hear, because of the change in the voice, that a new interpreter was in the interpreter's booth attempting to interpret what was going on in the House of Commons and used different words. I will get to that in a second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247563">There is a specific reason why we use the term “interpreters” and not “translators” in the House of Commons. It is because simultaneous interpretation goes on here. I have the greatest respect for this work because it is an incredibly difficult job, particularly in the cut and thrust of a question period session. Our interpreters try to understand, but not the exact words. That is not what they do. They do not translate word for word what is being said in the House, but they have to very quickly establish the essence of the question or the answer coming from the government and provide an interpretation of that question and that answer to get the best essence of what is being proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247564">The reason this is important in our conversation today is that there were quite serious accusations made and there were obviously feelings hurt on the side of the government, because of the use of the word <I>saccager</I>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247565">The exact words were, “la ministre responsable du saccage de l'assurance-emploi”, the minister responsible for butchering employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3247566">The topic being discussed was the misuse and abuse of the employment insurance system, whereby the government has not only thrown many hundreds of thousands of Canadians off employment insurance, making them ineligible, it has also further exacerbated the insult and the problem by going door to door and performing what some, not myself but others, have called a witch hunt upon those who have rightfully claimed access to employment insurance, which they have paid into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247567">The point of the word <I>saccager</I> is that one interpretation of what transpired on Friday had <I>saccager</I> as destroying, gutting, wreaking havoc or butchering the employment insurance program. Another interpretation would be the word “looting”. In some of our House discourse, impugning someone by saying he is committing a theft, that the government or a particular minister has stolen something from, in this case, the recipients of employment insurance who have paid into the program, is something that has been found out of order in the past. It has been found to be unparliamentary language. I would agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247568">In terms of whether a minister is destroying a program, butchering a program or causing a program not to function, there are many candidates within the government that may fall under that particular accusation. We have never found in this place that it is out of order or unparliamentary to suggest that a minister is not performing their job very well. In the opposition's role of holding the government to account, we find far too many instances in which a minister has not performed their duties to the Canadian people responsibly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247569">Accusations of incivility and, in fact, misogyny are quite strong to make, particularly when made against female members of the opposition by a female minister of the Crown. It is a bit rich for the Conservative government to suggest that the strong feminist voices coming from the New Democratic official benches are somehow representing a misogynistic view of the world. We take the accusation very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247570">In terms of civility and general decorum in this place, I am very tempted to look to the constant and uncivil attacks that come from the government benches on a daily basis, in question period and outside, and say that it is a somewhat hypocritical stance for the government House leader to suddenly be seized with the idea of civility. However, I will maintain that the purpose and the cause of our initiative to have more decorum and civility in the House of Commons overrides my temptation to further accuse the government of its various personal attacks on members of the opposition, which happen, again, on a daily basis. The higher cause calls me to say that while we will avoid calling ministers particular names in their titles, or misappropriating their titles to make a point, we will not, because it is not appropriate for us, desist from the role of the official opposition when a minister is badly doing his or her job and badly representing the Crown.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3247571">The official opposition will talk about the butchering of the employment insurance program until this government changes its position, until it guarantees that the employment insurance program will be restored to its previous form.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3247572">I was keenly interested in hearing the government House leader call for civility. Perhaps he can call off his member, who consistently uses McCarthyism tactics to call into question the loyalty and fealty of various members of Parliament or others. He suggests that they are somehow traitorous in their actions when they express an opinion or that Canadians are enemies of the state or foreign-funded radicals when they happen to express a view. The government would do well to take some of its own advice in this regard. If civility is what the Conservatives want, then civility is what they will get from members of the official opposition, but it would be hypocritical for a government to call for such civility, decency and decorum in our debate and then not exercise that same civility.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247583">She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a very specific set of changes with which I hope the House will find favour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247584">As we know, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is, for the most part, supported by people throughout the House. It is an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make other consequential amendments. The piece I want to focus on is quite critical and deserves consideration at report stage. It is about changes to the military policing process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247585"> If we go back to why it matters, we go back to an incident Canadians would sooner forget: the shameful incidents that occurred in Somalia involving Canadian armed forces and the subsequent efforts to interfere with that investigation. That led to an entirely new accountability framework, which I am holding here. The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff and the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal co-signed an accountability framework in March 1998 to set out the principles for proper operational flow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247586"> The primacy of operations as well as the need for independence in investigations are recognized. Striving towards these complementary objectives through a transparent, timely and responsive process are described in this framework agreement as being critical. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247587">These are very important principles that are embodied in the document. What Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> does is throw them out the window. I have brought forward these amendments to get the relationship back to where it should be, under the accountability framework, to ensure that senior military officials cannot interfere in an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247588"> It is unseemly to imagine that we would have a military investigation. Again, let us cast our minds back to a situation like Somalia. We can all hope that such a thing will never happen again. To have some assurance, we need to have good systems of law, accountability, clear lines of authority and absolute certainty that senior defence staff cannot intervene in an investigation to engage in a cover-up. That is why we have the accountability measures that currently exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247589">In the section of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> I propose to amend, we have something quite extraordinary. We have a change in the relationship. For members who are following along, the relevant section of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is clause 4, proposed subsection 18.5(3). Here we find the bill turning the accountability framework on its head. We find the following words: “The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff may issue instructions or guidelines in writing in respect of a particular investigation". In proposed subsection 18.5(4) we find: “The Provost Marshal shall ensure that the instructions and guidelines issued under subsection (3)”—in other words, by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff— “are available to the public”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247590">That is what we have in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, and that is why my amendments propose to clean it up. My amendments, very clearly, would ensure that the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff may, with the consent of the Provost Marshal, in accordance with their respective roles and responsibilities and the principles set out in the accountability framework to which I have just referred, issue instructions and guidelines in writing along with the rationale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247591">My amendment still meets the government's purpose. The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff may still issue instructions, but only with the consent of the Provost Marshal and only if consistent with the framework agreement under which our military policing system has been living since 1998.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247592">Am I the only one who thinks that we need these amendments? No, I am not. I felt that it was important to bring them forward when there was significant testimony before the committee coming from none other than the Military Police Complaints Commission. The Military Police Complaints Commission, which was represented by senior counsel, said, “We don't think it's intended to be used in any kind of nefarious way, but it sort of calls into question what is and isn't improper interference”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247593">That could be called the understatement of the year. It definitely calls into question what could be called improper interference. This was also pointed out by a very significant witness before the committee, a professor of law from the University of Toronto, Professor Kent Roach, who in his substantive presentation to the committee made some very telling points.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247594">There are reasons we have an accountability framework, and it is very important that this legislation not turn that on its head, undo accountability and open the door to completely improper interference in investigations by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff. This is, of course, I hasten to add, not specific to any individuals holding the posts in the current era or in the past. However, as a matter of good principle and good policy, one does not put in place a system that is open to such clear abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247595">The provisions put forward by the Military Police Complaints Commission in its brief, which I want to point out, stated:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247601">Similarly, I want to mention that the University of Toronto professor to whom I referred earlier, Kent Roach, also spoke of the critical importance of police independence in investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247602">I am putting forward two small amendments. They do not deter or distract from the overall purpose of this act. Anyone who examines the history of why the accountability framework was brought forward in 1998 will see clearly that it is good public policy. It is a wise provision to ensure independence. It is not just that justice must be done but that it must be seen to be done. Opening the door to this kind of abuse goes against all principles, natural justice, the rule of law and the independence of an investigator from top-down interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247603">I know it is unusual to pass amendments at report stage, but these are clear and straightforward and meet the demands and strong recommendations of the Military Police Complaints Commission itself. They make sense, and I urge members on all sides of the House to support these amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> at report stage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247613">The amendment I am putting forward is entirely consistent with what the government says it wants to do. As currently drafted, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> would create the opportunity for top-down military hierarchy meddling in investigations where it should not be meddling. With the fact that the amendment, as I have put it forward, specifically refers to the accountability framework and the sections therein and would allow the Chief of the Defence Staff to issue instructions where the Provost Marshal consents, I think we have plugged what could become a very significant hole. I am using the word “hole”. It is the kind of weakening that emerges when we allow one part of a framework to allow evil to slip in. We do not want top-down political interference in a military hierarchy. The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff should not be able to give instructions to the Provost Marshal. It is as clear as day that is the wrong way to go if the accountability framework is turned on its head, even in the guise of implementing and giving statutory authority to the accountability framework.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247614">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this place again at report stage debate on Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, a bill that is absolutely fundamental to the well-being of the Canadian Forces and to the modernization of the military justice system, which is at the absolute core of its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247615">I would invite all hon. members, if they are ever asking themselves about the relevance of this debate and the relevance of this bill, to have a look at the National Defence Act. It is a weighty document in both languages, which is mostly devoted to the military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247616">Roughly 180 pages out of 230 pages of this document are devoted to the military justice system because of the special need of our Canadian armed forces at home and abroad to maintain discipline and to maintain operational effectiveness while ensuring that justice is done both when they are training on their bases at home in peacetime and also amid the uncertainties and exigencies of the combat they have been involved from time to time throughout their history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247617">This is an important bill. I find it surprising that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> would raise amendments at this stage on a very specific part of the bill regarding the role of the Provost Marshal, which is going to be enshrined under this legislation much more clearly in law than ever before, but without mentioning the requirement for operational effectiveness, mission success. That is why we have a military justice system that is separate from the civilian system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247618">We make a special request of the Canadian armed forces soldiers, sailors and aircrew when they go on missions and when they are at home preparing for such missions. We ask them to live under a justice system that will meet the special requirements of those dangerous situations in which they find themselves from time to time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247619">The failure to refer to these urgent operational requirements is very revealing in the presentation from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. It shows that she has not understood why we have a military justice system and she has not understood the balance that has been struck throughout this legislation, not just in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> but in all bills that have established our excellent military justice system over decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247620"> She has not followed the testimony of witnesses, across the board, in committee and outside of committee, indeed, because most of those best qualified to pronounce on this issue agree with the balance that has been struck in this legislation. The two witnesses the member mentions are in fact the only two I can remember having commented at all positively on the kind of proposal she is making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247621">It is also extraordinary that the member would introduce these amendments at this very late stage in debate of this bill. We have had dozens of speeches. We have had days and weeks of testimony in committee. This is the fourth Parliament to be considering these amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247622">We are here in the 41st Parliament. There was a similar bill before the 40th Parliament, the 39th Parliament and the 38th Parliament. The recommendations we are trying to enact, at long last, are more than a decade old. They actually came forward in the 36th Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247623">How many people were here during the 36th Parliament? Was anyone here? There were a very few. Certainly the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> was not here, and neither was I.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247624">I also have a sense of déja vu in that I think some of us were standing in this House a full year ago, on budget day, discussing military justice. It was Bill <Document DbId="5156548" Type="3">C-16</Document>, an urgent portion of this bill that was taken out of the bill because we were not moving quickly enough on the bill. Here we are again today, going around in circles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247625">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> proposes to put into legislation the appointment, duties and functions of the Provost Marshal as recommended by the Lamer report. He suggested the National Defence Act be amended to define the role of the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal and to set out a framework concerning the relationship between the CFPM, the military police and the chain of command.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247629">I hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> telling us that we should simply buy into a mention of an accountability framework with a specific date, 1998, in the legislation. We do not mention administrative documents in legislation passed by this House. We do not do that. That is not good legislative practice, in this place or in the other place. What we are trying to do is take the content of that accountability framework, which I agree is important, and turn it into legislative terms, which is what this bill would do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247630">The intent of proposed subsection 18.5(3) is to recognize the unique circumstances of the military police, who often operate in zones of armed conflict. I will mention that again: zones of armed conflict. I would like to hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, in her subsequent interventions, if there are any, inform this House as to how she proposes to deal with those circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247631">Military police may be going to investigate a situation, here or there on the battlefield, but they do not have knowledge of the operational next steps of the mission. They do not know if there is going to be direct fire called in at that location. They do not know if there is going to be a live fire training exercise at that location. They do not know if there is going to be an air strike at that location. That is what this provision in the bill, as unamended, seeks to allow the VCDS to inform the Provost Marshal of, and absolutely the Provost Marshal could make public the rationale. That is the default position. That is what is expected of the Provost Marshal. That is what the Provost Marshal would be empowered to do under the bill as unamended. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247632">However, in those rare cases when, for reasons of operational secrecy, the protection of Canadian lives or, if there is personal information involved in the investigation, privacy, the Provost Marshal may not make the instructions fully public or may not make them public at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247633">In other words, the intent of proposed section 18.5 is to strengthen the independence of the military police, as the default position is that the instructions must be made public, and it is unnecessary to refer to an administrative document. The VCDS would be responsible and accountable for the instructions he or she gives. While the fact of the issuance of the direction and its contents should be public, the rationale may be classified or engage issues of operational security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247634">Members of the Standing Committee on National Defence heard that some misgivings about section 18.5(3) were actually alleviated by subsequent clauses, which would provide for the transparency of any directions issued. Let us listen to Colonel Gibson, a senior member of the Judge Advocate General's Office, from his testimony on February 13. He said:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="2" IndentFirst="2">...there's the very important transparency provision set out at proposed sections 18.4 and 18.5, which says that the default position is that the instruction must be made public. It gives the discretion ultimately to whether or not to release that, having regard to the impact on a particular investigation, to the provost marshal.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247636"> Therefore the Provost Marshal has the hammer if he or she is concerned about this, and it is transparent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247637">We heard the Provost Marshal and the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff in committee expressing the view that this would be the right way to strike a balance. They were comfortable with this, that their independent ability to conduct investigations on the military police side would be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247638"> On our side, there really is not more information or more insight provided on this issue, either by the amendments presented today or by what we have heard in this House so far. I remind the members of the House that there have been three attempts previous to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, four if we count this bill, to amend this legislation to bring our military justice system up to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247639"> We in committee considered a wide range of amendments. We are grateful to all members of the committee for the full discussion we had. There are two amendments coming forward to this place, one of which is urgently required because it would reduce the likelihood that members of the Canadian Forces would be carrying into civilian life a criminal record for offences committed under the military justice system that do not justify a criminal record. We need to enact that change quickly. It has been close to a decade that we have been trying to do this, and we have failed so far. We are not serving the Canadian Forces well as long as we fail to pass this legislation, and we would like to move through report stage and third reading as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

It set out the roles of the relationship and that is in the act and we like that. However, this is a backward step. He knows that.

              <ParaText id="3247667">It has not been the practice of the House to be as ruthless in the application of a relevancy rule as the hon. member suggests. It certainly was not applied when the parliamentary secretary and others were speaking in the last half hour, and there is no reason it should apply now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247669">I raised a point of order when my amendments on Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> were being completely ignored by virtually every set speech of the Conservative members of Parliament. At the point where one member was talking about the economy of Greece, I rose and asked for the relevance to the amendments before us. I was told that they were generally on point because the subject of the bill was economic growth and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247670">Therefore, certainly the member for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> was in the ballpark of discussing my amendments, and many previous speeches on other bills have been way out of left field.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247672">In terms of general context, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170657" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation> is correct that the Standing Orders state that when members rise to speak to a matter before the House, their comments ought to be relevant to that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247673">It is also fair to say that historically and consistently the Chair has granted what some would consider significant latitude to members in the points they make in their presentations. From time to time, members take very indirect ways to come to their point. It is a good reminder for all members that they need to keep their comments relevant to the matter before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247674">On the second point, the hon. member is technically correct in that the parameters or leeway granted ought to be narrower when the House is considering amendments as opposed to general legislation potentially during second reading or third reading. However, once again I would suggest the Chair recognizes that in the course of a 10- or 20-minute speech, hon. members need to provide context to the comments they wish to make that are relevant to a matter before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247675">As an editorial comment, there are certainly times when members wander far afield from the matter before the House and are possibly beyond the grey area. However, in this case, I would suggest that has not happened. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> is certainly talking in the context of the bill.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247677">Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the Speaker and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170657" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation> that I have no intention to talk about ranching in western Canada or any other matters extraneous to the bill and the legislation before us, which would clearly be irrelevant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247678">I said that there were a number of amendments, 22 amendments, proposed by us in committee. One of them was very much related to what we have here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247679">I will say that not a single one of the amendments was accepted by the government members, showing a total lack of flexibility in terms of trying to make a better military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247680">However, one of our amendments was to remove this power because, as was pointed out, it was a backward step. The accountability framework was put in place as a result of recommendations from the Somali inquiry to ensure that the relationship between the military police and the understanding of its role was in fact spelled out. That is where this came from, and it has been in place for 15 years. No one before our committee, whether they were government officials, the Judge Advocate General representatives or anybody else, indicated that there was any problem with it, that it did not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247681">The parliamentary secretary says that the change has been brought to give effect to the accountability framework in legislation because he says it could be gotten rid of at any time. Well, this is taking away one of the most significant parts of this, which would guarantee the independence of the military police, which I think is the important principle at work here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247682">There is, and there was, as the parliamentary secretary said in his intervention, a long history of trying to seek to change this. We have been part of that. We have been trying to make the bill better and have spoken quite at length in this Parliament, and in the last Parliament, and in committees in both Parliaments, to seek to make this better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247683">One of the focuses, of course, has been on the criminal records. My colleague opposite referred to the urgency of that because of people getting criminal records. I do not disagree with that, although I would note that provision would be retroactive: it says not only those who have committed particular offences but also those who have been convicted of those offences. I think my colleague would agree that the provision would be retroactive, so if we pass it today or if we pass it tomorrow or next week, anybody who may be convicted of an offence during that period would not get a criminal record because the legislation would have looked after that. We are not certain that it is given effect to properly and we made amendments to see that. However, we will be watching that extremely carefully to ensure that the military men and women who ought not to have criminal records do not in fact have a record lying around somewhere, on some computer, that might affect their future. We are very attuned to that and have paid great attention to it in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247684">The positive aspects of this legislation do include spelling out the role of the Provost Marshal and do include spelling out the principles of sentencing and military justice, which is quite appropriate to do. The positive aspects of this include the possibility of having an absolute discharge, which was not there before, and allowing an intermittent sentence if someone is confined to detention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247685">There are a number of positive aspects to this legislation that move the bar somewhat forward, but not to where it ought to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247686">One thing that came through during the hearings at committee was an overwhelming confidence by the witnesses on behalf of the government. The government witnesses were extremely certain that all the measures that were being proposed were constitutional and were within the Charter of Rights and Freedoms—charter-proof, in fact. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247687">However, that has not been the experience of the military justice system since 1990, when the Court Martial Appeal Court determined that the standing court martial was unconstitutional, that the procedure for selection of mode of trial was unconstitutional and that the general court martial was unconstitutional. These are things that have happened despite the fact that the government took the position that everything was within the Constitution and charter-proof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247688">We have a concern about that. There is a need for an overall review. This, however, is a backward step and ought not to happen.</ParaText>

Why is it that he is speaking, after all our consideration in committee of this issue, in favour of a reprised amendment, essentially, that goes against the testimony of the Provost Marshal of the Canadian Forces on March 2, when he said that the safeguards in place are robust, and goes against the testimony of the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, who says that this provision is required to potentially save lives on the battlefield, using the example of a live fire exercise?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247693">We may have different opinions, but I accept the testimony of someone who is experienced in the field who says that military police officers do not walk into the line of fire to conduct an interview with somebody during a police investigation. They are not stupid people. Not only that, they would certainly take advice from the commanding officer in the field if he said, by the way, it was not a good idea to go over there or to that place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247694">This is not about somebody in the field telling what is going on. This is about the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff sitting in Ottawa issuing written instructions to somebody anywhere, maybe even in Ottawa, that they shall not do a particular investigation.

              <ParaText id="3247701">Mr. Speaker, may I say at the outset that we are generally supportive of this bill? It is a wonderful opportunity to move military justice from the 19th century into the 21st century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247702">Regrettably, for some reason or another, the government stopped at the 20th century. The debate that has been going on for the better part of an hour is somewhat typical of the government's resistance to, in effect, moving a military system all the way up into the 21st century, so that a soldier, sailor or airman or airwoman is entitled to the same rights and protections as those to which we, as civilians, are entitled. As one witness said, just because they put on a uniform, it does not mean they lose their rights as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247703">The parliamentary secretary is quite correct to say that this bill has seen a lot of reiterations prior to its arrival here on the floor of the House. Some of the reasons it is here at this very late stage are good, and some of the reasons it is here now are not so good. However, I am not going to spend my time criticizing who actually controls the pace of legislation in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247704">It is not very often that we get an opportunity to reform our military justice system, and it is kind of disappointing on the part of the government to reach for mediocrity. In the words of Winston Churchill, it is “The Tory fault - a yearning for mediocrity”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247705">It is a bit of a shame, because we expect so much of our men and women in uniform. I think they should have every right to expect from us an attitude where we give them the best possible justice system. They should be entitled to equal treatment before the law. If we said that to people out on Wellington Street, they would reply that of course they are entitled to equal treatment before the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247706">In fact, men and women in uniform have a higher burden. It is kind of ironic that we ask them to risk their lives, and they have an unlimited liability, yet we do not give them the same basic procedural fairness that we, ourselves, expect when we go before a judge in certain circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247707">The additional burden that men and women in uniform bear is with respect to service offences. I do commend the government for actually having moved on this. The core issue was that service offences, which run all the way from wearing the military uniform in an improper manner right through to treason, are difficult offences, additional burdens that civilians do not bear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247708">At both ends of the spectrum, the most serious and the least serious, the treatment is probably appropriate. It is the stuff that is in between that is somewhat problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247709">All investigations start with a police investigation of some kind or another. Members would take the view that police investigations should be free from political interference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247710">Mr. Speaker, I know you are from the beautiful town of Haliburton. We know that is one of the most beautiful places in all of Ontario, if not all of Canada. You and I share that view. Nevertheless, it would be improper for the mayor of that community to phone up the local police chief and say that the chief can do this investigation but not that one, or that if the chief does the investigation, it should only go here and not there. We would rightly regard that as interference in a police investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247711">However, the clause we have been talking about here actually retains that power. The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff may issue instructions or guidelines in writing. We would never allow a bylaw or a law in civil justice to say that the mayor or the premier, or the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for that matter, may issue instructions or guidelines in respect of a particular investigation.</ParaText>

It would also effectively contradict, even repudiate, the notion of improper interference by the chain of command as established in the oversight jurisdiction of the Military Police Complaints Commission and thereby effectively eliminate oversight by statutory authorization.....</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247714">This is not merely a speculative issue. We have heard references previously made to Somalia. Somalia was an accident. It was a grotesque accident that did not reflect well on the military. The only reason that it got any kind of investigation at all, which ultimately resulted in an inquiry, was by happenstance. The happenstance was that there were reporters present at the time doing what reporters normally do. Otherwise it never would have seen the light of day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247715"> What made that investigation quite problematic was the interference of the chain of command who did not want it to occur. If it was going to occur, they wanted it to occur in a particular way and they certainly did not want any kind of inquiry. That is what drove this issue and ultimately resulted in a protocol. The protocol essentially said that one cannot interfere in a police investigation. This has been the protocol that has been in existence since the Somalia inquiry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247716">However, the government seems to want to appropriate back to itself the right of the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, Chief of the Defence Staff, the minister or the Prime Minister the opportunity to give instructions and guidelines with respect to a particular investigation on any particular situation. Reference has been made as to whether this is charter proof or not. Certainly the government's line is that it is charter proof because it says it is charter proof, which is inadequate. There certainly is no proof that it is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247717">I had suggested to witnesses that this is similar to the government painting a big target on its forehead and saying: “Sue me. Challenge us in court”. However, the problem is that the investigation on which it will be launched, which I think is a certainty, will be a horrible fact situation. It will be on an awful fact situation that some defence lawyer will challenge this section, and if it is overturned, then the whole investigation will go sideways and justice may not be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247718">We have suggested on the opposition side that the government stay with the current protocol. “If it ain't broke, don't fix it”. Currently, it is working. The military police feel perfectly free to conduct investigations as and when it sees fit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247719">The government has made this crazy argument that this is for operational requirements and all that sort of stuff. That is just nonsense. Most military police do not go into live fire zones to conduct an investigation. They do not interfere with exercises and all of the other things that our men and women in uniform do for us. Therefore, the government's arguments are thin indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247720">Unfortunately, I have not been able to talk about several other elements of the testimony. I regret that we were not able to get into the basic concept that we should treat our men and women in uniform in exactly the same manner as we expect to be treated, absent of compelling reasons to the contrary. On the absence of a compelling reason to the contrary, the burden is on the military, i.e., the government, to justify either interference in a police investigation or interference in a solider's or sailor's rights.</ParaText>

However, that is typical and it is typical of the stalling tactics by the opposition. In three years under a Liberal government, there was a failure to implement the Lamer recommendations, and in four Parliaments the opposition has conspired to hold back the amendments embodied in the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247786">No, Mr. Speaker. I think that the commanders of our units and platoons are smart enough to figure out when an investigation is appropriate. You do not carry out an investigation when you are being fired upon. That would be ridiculous. When you are being fired upon, you defend yourself and you get out of there. It is not time to get out your paper and your pencil and take statements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247787">I think that, logically, everybody knows that an investigation will take place when the time is right, not in the middle of an attack or an operation.

If that was my colleague's question, I think that the answer is obvious.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247788">I want to start my remarks by thanking you, Mr. Speaker, regarding the issue that was raised about relevancy. I think the various Speakers in this place are quite, pardon the term, liberal in the way that they allow us to put things into context, because each one of us brings to the House a particular life experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247789">I hate to say this, but in my case it was 50 years ago that I was in the Canadian military for a couple of years. I recall one of the first things we were talked to about was good order and discipline. I want to take members back for a moment, again, in the sense of a context of the power and the control that is exercised within military circles. If we were in the military in 1914 and going through basic training, they would be firing live ammunition over the top of us as we crawled through a field. Obviously, over time, those kinds of things changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247790">I was in the military in 1963-64. Two years before, a corporal would have had the right to strike me if I was doing something he was not satisfied with. That changed. At the time I was there, they still found ways to draw our attention to their dissatisfaction. As we stood at attention, they would come over and say, “Excuse me, I'm adjusting your tie” and then adjust it so tight that we would start to turn blue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247791">The context and the reason I am saying this is that it shows the thinking of those people in power and why there has to be some kind of limitation. Rights have evolved for all Canadians in this country over a number of years, particularly the last 50 to 75 years. Other speakers today have talked about the fact that Canadians, average Canadians on the street, would believe that those rules and rights apply to all citizens. Therefore, we find ourselves in a situation, and I will not give the history as others have done, where corrective measures were started in previous houses of Parliament. We did not succeed at those times in concluding them. Then we got to the point where Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> was brought forward. I understand it was a year, roughly, since the last report calling for change had been received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247792">There are other remarks I would like to make but I want to speak directly to the amendments that have been proposed today. I want to say very clearly that we do not agree all the time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. However, in these two amendments, she is attempting to go further than the members of the committee were allowed to go by the government, because some of the amendments we proposed in that committee were voted down by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247793">This, at least, affords us all the opportunity to discuss at length some important aspects of the bill that are missing. If we give consideration to the requirement of the Vice Chief of Defence Staff to make a relevant rationale available to the public regarding his or her instructions or guidelines given to the Provost Marshal, that is a very serious application of accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247794">When I describe the things that have changed within the military from those past years, from the live fire in training to striking people and all those things, over time people came to clearly understand what improper usage is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247795">This is one of those cases where now we have the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff put in the public purview where the public will be able to see what his rationale was. I think that would improve the situation. It would require a level of due diligence that is not required today. Therefore, I certainly support that amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247796">The second amendment would require that instructions or guidelines given by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, again, to the Provost Marshal, be in accordance with the respective roles, responsibilities and principles set out in the accountability framework, signed by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff and Provost Marshal back in 1998. Think of that date. We hear government members on the other side talk about how long it has taken to accomplish changes. It certainly has been a while. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247797">Again, I want to stress that the NDP supports these amendments.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247798">The accountability framework states that the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff shall not direct the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal with regard to military police operational decisions relative to an investigation. We have an area here where we are going to have a contradiction in the framework resulting from the amendment, which could be problematic going forward. From our perspective, that whole provision should have been removed. Hopefully I am being clear in the sense of the relationship between these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247799">We do believe, though, that the amendment is an improvement. It does not go where we would like it to go totally, but it is an improvement on what is in the bill. We strongly believe that granting the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff the authority is in clear violation of that previous aspect. Very clearly, that just means, to the government side, that there is going to be more work required here on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247800">I would like to go back to some of the notes I put together a little earlier. I had added those additional thoughts as I was sitting and listening to the debate here. In this place we often comment, particularly across to the other side, about the limitations on debate and the fact that time allocation, over and over, has prevented us from properly looking at a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247801">In this place we all know that sometimes when we are sitting here on House duty that there are debates that do not have the depth that they should have. Most times there is something we can learn from listening to the other members of Parliament. For example, for myself, the first few minutes of my presentation today came about because of the reminders coming from the statements from the government side and from previous members who spoke before me. The value of having that open debate is so important to this place and to what we are able to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247802">Let us go back to a previous bill, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, which I have not studied to the depth that committee members would have. When it came out of committee it had some recommendations that had passed at the committee stage but were left out of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. We are kind of struggling on this side of the House to understand why that was necessary. When there was agreement in the previous committee on Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, why would the government not say, “We have looked at this. We have studied it. We will advance it forward in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>”? The government chose not to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247803">I would suggest a major omission was the failure to include a broadened list of offences, removed from the consequences of a criminal record. During the process on Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, New Democrats, both in the House and in committee, pressed for changes and amendments in that area. The purpose of that was to reduce the effect of disciplinary offences regarding possible criminal records.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247804"> We also challenged the failure of full charter rights in these cases. Full charter rights are as fundamental as it gets. There is no excuse or justification in my mind for a person who is serving their country, in some instances putting their lives at risk, to not have the value of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as every other Canadian has. Our military members, if anyone, who defend our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, who defend our very freedom, should have the absolute rights of all Canadians. I think it is incumbent upon this place to ensure that happens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247835">The important thing to consider is that we hear from the government side how much delay there has been, yet it has delayed repeatedly in the House today by interrupting speakers and questions. Who is doing the delaying?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247836">Getting back to the commentary on the British system, the rights given their military personnel are exactly what Canadians believe we have already. If we were to go out on the street and talk to average Canadians, they would believe that we have that. The government would be wise to consider the approach of the British government in dealing with its military and in protecting its rights. Canadian soldiers, sailors and personnel deserve exactly the same rights as well, as their charter rights.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247837">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate. I had the great pleasure of being before the committee with the Parliamentary Secretary when there were some witnesses who were talking about the very things the amendments today refer to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247838">I am pleased, because during that debate in the committee, there was a sense, on the issue of summary conviction, that we were not going to get to where we needed to be. I can say to my friends across the way from the committee that I am pleased that we almost got all the way there. I say almost, because it was not all the way, in our view. Nonetheless, on the summary conviction piece, it seems that the testimony was heard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247839">Without a doubt, the fact that the government side brought forward a change to that piece was welcome. Those are the things we were talking about during those particular two hours with the witnesses. It was a key piece to finding our way through, as much as we had asked for it before. It had been passed historically. Lots of folks have gone through that history and have noted where we were at certain points in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247840">This brings us back to the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff and his authority. There is no question that ordinary people who have never served in the military—I am one of them; there are more of us who have not served than who have—do not truly understand the nature of the criminal justice system within the defence department, because it is unique. Folks are asked to do things that the rest of us are never asked to do in most circumstances. Some of us may have been asked to do certain things, but certainly not to the same degree. As a result, it becomes a unique piece unto itself. The issue is whether that uniqueness changes our ability to give those folks who are in that unique area the same rights as everyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247841">I am not suggesting that it is easy. It is not. This is a complicated piece. The parliamentary secretary, quite articulately, asked about being under live fire. That does not necessarily mean being at war. It could be a live-fire exercise. Live fire could be on Canadian soil at a base somewhere where they are actually doing something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247842"> How do we make sure that folks do not do that? The government's sense is that we need a chain of command, because that is what the forces are used to. They have a sense of a chain of command and who gives the orders. That is how the system works. It is a hierarchical system, and it has to be that way in the sense that when one gives a command, someone has to follow the command and do whatever that is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247843">How do we fit that piece in a civilian justice system? These are still Canadian citizens, albeit in the armed forces, who we expect to be treated a certain way. I would suggest that they need to be treated in a special way, but not necessarily inside the justice system. That is simply out of respect for them for the things they do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247844">How do we manage to do that piece? I hear the government side saying that we need to have a chain of command, and we need to trust it. I do not want to put words in the government's mouth, but my sense is that the Vice Chair of the Defence Staff can instruct the Provost Marshal and the Vice Provost Marshal to do the right thing. I am not saying that it is wrong to have that trust. However, what if they get it wrong? Is there a check and balance in the system so that if we get it wrong, we have the ability to check it? Unfortunately, the way the legislation is, we do not have that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247845">In a normal justice system, we absolutely have checks and balances. We may see folks who we would all agree should maybe be incarcerated. Perhaps they should be, but the system was not followed the way it was meant to be followed, with the right evidence, the right to a fair trial, the right to be told that one might be charged and the right to representation. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247846">Some of us may have read about, and many of the folks here who are lawyers may have had experiences with, the fact that folks have been discharged from a criminal charge in the civil system because of their rights not being followed in an appropriate and correct manner. Yet we could probably agree that the people might be guilty. However, the rules are meant to protect all of us who might be charged unjustly. The weakness is not so much a mistrust for the armed forces because we have none. The piece is about the safeguards for the individuals. We need to consider whether their rights under the charter have been waived. There is a lot of evidence to say that is not the case. When people sign on the dotted line to say that they intend to come and work on behalf of whomever, they have not waived those rights as individuals under the charter. Therefore, how do we work with those pieces?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247847">My friend from <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> has been working on this file for a while now. I have to thank him for the opportunity to go and sub for him from time to time when he is elsewhere. I have had the great pleasure to hear what folks have commented on this. That was the intent that this side had in proposing amendments. We were pleased the government took hold of the amendment on summary conviction. The other amendment is around this sense of the Vice Chief of Defence Staff and how he or she might instruct an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247848">In the past we have seen where instructions in a civil investigation can go sideways if it looks as though it is not being done in an open, transparent and fair manner. In civil society we then hear the traditional phrase that it is a whitewash because there is no faith in the system. It is not good enough for a system to function, especially a criminal justice system. It must be seen to function not only effectively but fairly and justly, otherwise it is deemed to not be working at all, regardless of who is inside it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247849"> That is the piece we are trying to get the government to see. It is not the case that we cannot trust the Vice Chief of Defence. I do not believe my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> has ever said that. From this side, I have heard a number of my colleagues talk about the great faith they have in the defence department and the men and women who serve in it and the honour they carry forward. The issue is one of how we make the system such that people look at it and deem it to be fair, just and transparent enough so they can say that it works. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247850">I suggest that not everybody who is charged is actually guilty. We get what the parliamentary secretary has called the live fire exercise, which is a situation where we are engaged in hot theatre. Those are two particularly unique circumstances where one would hope the training of the military police officers would not enter into. However, let us assume they did not know there was a live fire at Gagetown, Petawawa, or wherever in the country. Would they expect the commanding officer to say that there was a live fire? We would expect that to happen. The issue then would they could not go in until, rather than they could not go in at all. The problem with a command not doing it at all perhaps becomes not seeing justice done fairly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247851">Both sides are not far away from where they want to be. What we are debating is this whole sense of how we get there. The belief on the government side is to do it through a chain of command that we trust. Our sense is through a civilian piece or a part that looks like a civilian piece that could be included here. Some of the key witnesses who have experience in the area of military court proceedings, whether it be Lamer, Létourneau or other justices of the courts, have said that we ought to head in that direction. Frankly, I place a lot of trust in where they have decided to take us and where they think we should go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247852">Therefore, I would encourage the government to take a look at those pieces and move in a holistic approach to this. A band-aid on a problem is just that, a band-aid. It does not heal the situation or fix the overall piece. It simply puts a band-aid on it, which is really where we are with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247853">I look forward to questions or comments from my colleagues. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247854">Mr. Speaker, I want to go to another portion of section 18 that we have not discussed yet in relation to my amendments. It is one of the ones that disturbs me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247855">We heard from the parliamentary secretary that there are safeguards because these instructions will eventually be made public from the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, who in my view should not be interfering in military police investigations. However, when we look at section 18.5(5), we find that there are instances where the legislation contemplates never making it public at all. The Vice Chief of Defence Staff has given instructions and interfered with an investigation if the Provost Marshal considers “that it would not be in the best interests of the administration of justice for that instruction or guideline to be made available to the public”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247856">We know military justice is different. How far from the Charter of Rights and Freedoms do we move if there are also provisions that these instructions are never made public?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247857">Mr. Speaker, the thing about justice is it must always be seen to be transparent, being done as well as accomplishing a fair trial and process. The justice system is not just about charge and conviction, or charge and acquittal. It is about a process that starts from an investigation, to a charge, to a process trial of some description and an outcome. It has to be seen as being open, fair and transparent. That means we need to be inside that piece. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247858">There is special legislation around certain aspects where that is not the case. However, inside the military in these aspects it is very much necessary for it to be open. It cannot be any other way if we are to truly have a fair justice system that folks respect. That is really what it is about, respecting the system. It is not about the outcome of individual cases. It truly needs to be seen as being transparent. It needs to be seen as being done in a fair and honest way and cannot be done in any other fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247859">To have pieces where we can say “This can go, but this cannot” then starts to impugn the system in the minds of folks looking at it. It is not necessarily the way to have a system that would actually, at the end of the day, deem itself to be fair or seem to be fair. That is a major problem. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247861">I have two main concerns about the motions being brought forward to amend Bill<Document DbId="5156729" Type="3"> C-15</Document> at report stage.

              <ParaText id="3247862">With Motion No. 1, we are setting a dangerous precedent. This is something where we would refer to a technical document in legislation. It could be expanded and become more of a policy document. Usually in legislation we only refer to regulations and never to technical documents. We are taking away the ability of parliamentarians to review everything that is legislatively responsible to Canadians, in this case the Canadian Forces. We are turning that technical document, which is a living, breathing entity that changes from time to time, depending on who the vice chief of defence staff is, and others are, into legislation. That management document should never be referred to in legislation.</ParaText>

That needs to be reviewed by folks who understand the technical aspects and nature of it, and that is fair.

That type of issue would have to be dealt with because it would be a national security issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247864">The court system deals with the rights of privacy all the time. It is judged whether it is in the public interest to be open or to be closed. That happens on the civilian side quite often, such as in the most recent Magnotta trial, where folks ask if it should be closed or open. Those rights are determined by the judge inside of the courtroom. That determination would be done on a case-by-case basis, not a unilateral basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247865"> My view is it needs to be open as many times as it possibly humanly can, with the exception of unique situations that the judge would determine at that moment in time, with the rights to appeal and all those other pieces. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247866">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be on my feet today to talk to Bill C-15 at report stage and to deal with a colleague's proposed amendment to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15, An Act to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247867">The title is interesting. One wishes there were a shorter handle on the title, but it is also more commonly known as the “strengthening military justice in the defence of Canada act”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247868"> We have had lots of discussion this morning on the issue of relevance of the debate and what we are talking about. What is important to understand and appreciate here is that the amendment before us for discussion and debate is a piece of a system. It sits in the broader context of the military justice system. It is important to understand the relationship of that amendment and the issues implicated by that amendment in the context of the broader justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247869"> Members may recall that we had opposed this bill at second reading on this side of the House, but an important amendment has come out of committee that allows us to reluctantly support the bill when we move on to third stage. I say “reluctantly” because the bill would still be far from what it ought to be. It would make a number of changes to the military justice system that would be positive, but not all of its changes would be positive, and that is why our colleague's proposed amendment to the bill is welcome today. It is an important issue to contemplate and debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247870">The bill has had a long history. It was 10 years in the making to get to this point, and it is important that it get a thorough vetting. The parliamentary secretary talks as though his party was not in government for seven of those years, but in fact it was, and he should be asking questions back in the lobby about why we waited around for seven years for this important bill to arrive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247871">Nevertheless, there is a long history to this bill. It emerges out of a couple of very comprehensive reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247872"> The Rt. Hon. Antonio Lamer had a crack at it in 2003. He made 88 recommendations, which is suggestive of some of the very significant deficiencies in the military justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247873">There was a Senate committee report dealing with the same matters. Then again there was another report by a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, Patrick LeSage, and the parliamentary secretary should contemplate why the Conservatives sat on that report for a year before bringing it forward if he is in such a hurry to see this bill and these changes implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247874">In the interim, we have had elections. The Liberals had two years with it as well, and they did not do anything, and we have had a Conservative prorogation. It seems there is a general resistance. In fact, we have even walked backwards from where we have been in earlier Parliaments, when we had Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> die on the order paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247875"> The significance of Bill C-41 was that it dealt with an issue that is very important to our party, and that is the issue of service-related offences that can proceed through summary trial and result in a criminal record. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247876">Former Colonel Michel Drapeau has spoken at length about the unique nature of military justice systems and the need to balance an expeditious justice system providing for deterrence and ensuring discipline, and the importance of that in having efficient armed forces while also ensuring that the rule of law predominates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247877">Therefore, in the military justice system we get this summary trial process which, in the normal course in civilian life, we would not recognize as a form of fair justice.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247878">In this process, one's own commander can sit in judgment and there are no transcripts, no right to counsel, et cetera. This is important, because about 95% of cases that go to trial go through this system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247879">However, we are supporting the bill because at the end of the day we have managed, over the years, to persuade the Conservative Party that fewer of the offences that can go through the summary trial procedure can actually attract a criminal record that a member of the armed forces might take into civilian life. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> would lessen the number of those offences. That is a very positive thing and that is why the bill, with or without this amendment, is worthy of our support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247880">Nevertheless, we are left with an approximate form of justice with this summary trial process, and this is where the importance of the amendment comes in. It is the investigation that precedes that approximate form of justice that becomes extremely important, and that investigation process must be done properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247881">The Conservatives have taken the accountability framework that was put together following the Somalia inquiry that set out the relationship between the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff and the Provost Marshal and are turning that administrative document into statute, which is a worthy thing to do. However, in the course of doing so, the Conservatives have done something quite unfortunate, and that brings rise to the amendment today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247882">This amendment is worthy because the bill would provide new powers to the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff with respect to military police investigations, those very investigations that will end up in summary trials.

              <ParaText id="3247888">Those provisions are there, and they flow from the principles and purpose of the accountability framework.

              <ParaText id="3247889">The purpose of the accountability framework that came out of the Somalia inquiry is to ensure the provision of a professional and effective military police service for independent investigations, to balance competing interests and priorities and, critically, to ensure that the Provost Marshal is accountable to the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff for “developing and maintaining police standards which are consistent with those of other police agencies”. Who in Canada would want to deny the men and women of our Canadian armed forces an investigation into alleged misconduct that is consistent with those of other police agencies? </ParaText>

The general rule and principles set out in the accountability framework should survive in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. It is the expectation of Canadians that any justice system be fair and reasonable; I would even dare suggest that most Canadians would suggest that there be a higher onus on a justice system that applies to the men and women of our armed forces in light of what we ask them to do on our behalf.</ParaText>

There obviously is, because New Democrats are not taking the advice of military people, past and present, who have knowledge of this issue; they are taking the advice of people who want to undermine the core principles of the military justice system and civilianize it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247898">He also said there are no checks and balances. There are. The Provost Marshal is required in the unamended bill to make public the instructions, and if there is improper interference, he has the right to go to the Military Police Complaints Commission. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247899">The only argument we have heard from the other side is what I call the argument from stupidity, from the members for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="170172" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>: the idea that military police are not so stupid that they would ever go to the wrong place at the wrong time.

If the VCDS chooses to obey the law, which this amendment would have him do as we do in a civilian context, by never interfering or breathing a word to military police conducting an investigation, and military investigators went to a place where an exercise or military operation was about to take place that they did not know about, were not informed of and on which they did not have the benefit of secret operational information, where would the responsibility lie?</ParaText>

That accountability framework was signed by Vice-Admiral Garnett, who was the VCDS at the time, and Colonel Samson, who was the Provost Marshal at the time.</ParaText>

I must admit, they made very interesting and very precise speeches on the amendments proposed by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. I thank the hon. member for her efforts and for presenting these amendments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247905">I will come back to that a little later in my speech because it has been mentioned a few times that consideration of the amendments must be very precise at report stage, which is what I will try to do as much as possible today to enlighten my colleagues on this bill and, more specifically, on the amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247906">If I may, I would like to give a little background before moving on to the heart of the subject, even if it does not please my colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247907">I think Canadians listening to us would be very pleased to know how Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> ended up in the House, what we are currently doing and what still needs to be done for it to eventually become law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247908">The process began in 2003. In this debate today, we have been saying that the process began 10 years ago, following on the report of the Right Hon. Antonio Lamer, former chief justice of the Supreme Court. The report contained 88 recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247909">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is a kind of legislative response to the recommendations in that report. However, there is a big “but”, because Bill C-15 does not completely reflect those recommendations. In reality, it responds very little to the report that contained 88 recommendations. In fact, the government has attempted to implement only about 20 of them since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247910">Since 2003, the report by the hon. Patrick LeSage, retired Chief Justice of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has also been presented. That was in December 2011. On June 8, 2012, the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> himself tabled that report here in the House. Although the Conservative government has had the LeSage report for over a year, it still did not incorporate any of its recommendations into Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247911">As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> pointed out, the government has been sitting on that report for a year now and nothing has been implemented. The NDP, however, did try to have some of those recommendations incorporated into Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247912">There have also been several other versions. I will not spend too much time on this, since that is not really what interests us the most at this stage of the bill. However, there was also Bill <Document DbId="2164205" Type="3">C-7</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="3314337" Type="3">C-45</Document>, which both died on the order paper because of the 2008 election after Parliament was prorogued. Then, in July 2008, there was another version, Bill <Document DbId="3546541" Type="3">C-60</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247913">The bill that was most in line with what we wanted was Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, introduced in 2010, also further to the Lamer report. All of the bills introduced after that report were basically in response to that report. Bill C-41, which had fortunately been amended in committee, also died on the order paper because an election was called, which, as some people may recall, was due to a case of contempt of Parliament on the part of the Conservative government, on a question of access to sensitive documents. That is also not the subject of today's debate. We all remember what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247914">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is similar to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, which was the result of committee work in the last session. However, significant amendments made at committee stage during the last Parliament were not included in Bill C-15. When Bill C-15 was introduced, one of our biggest disappointments was that it did not contain all of the changes made to Bill C-41 during the previous Parliament. We were very disappointed, and we wondered why they had not been included in Bill C-15.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247915">However, I should point out that we had a small win in committee and we managed to do some good. Not that long ago, we had to make changes so that nearly 95% of the offences in the code of discipline would no longer result in a criminal record. That is an important win for us. Canadians who do not serve in the Canadian Forces are subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which uses a fair and balanced justice system to protect the public. However, we felt that members of the Canadian Forces were not offered the same protection as other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247916">That brings me to the two amendments proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. I would like to read Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, as it now stands. We are talking about clause 4 of the bill, which would add sections 18.3 through 18.6 to the current National Defence Act, after the existing section 18.2. The two amendments focus on subsections 18.5(3) and 18.5(4), which read as follows:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247919">We tried to amend these provisions in committee. Unfortunately, those amendments were not accepted and the provisions remained unchanged. Today, two motions were moved. We want to expand on clause 4 to make it a bit more specific by adding the following:</ParaText>

All of clause 4 is, in fact, an addition to the current National Defence Act with regard to the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247922">In our opinion, subsection 18.5(3) was much too problematic. The statement that “[t]he Vice Chief of the Defence Staff may issue instructions or guidelines in writing in respect of a particular investigation” means that the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff has the power to give instructions to the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal with respect to a particular investigation. </ParaText>

He spoke about the mayor of a city calling up the local police chief and telling him how to proceed with an investigation or what he can or cannot do. We would regard that as direct interference in the right to an independent police investigation, whether it was being conducted by the civilian or military police. The law must be much more clear and transparent to ensure that there is no interference in investigations, which must remain as independent as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247946">However, because of politics, we are all going to be playing the blame game, pointing to other members and saying they slowed it down, saying they did not do the right thing. The fact remains that our fellow citizens in uniform cannot be too pleased with the way we are treating their legal system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247947">If I might say, it is one thing to be saluting the troops, acknowledging the troops and thanking them, but there is a whole lot more to it than just sending them off to be in harm's way. There is so much more to what it means for a nation to be supporting its soldiers, rather than just waving, saluting and saying “Yay, way to go.” This is one of those times and one of those areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247948">I was looking at the debate last time, and it was interesting because the accusations being hurled from the government members were that we were trying to slow it down, and I think their main reason was that we supposedly did not like defence or we did not like the armed forces, which makes no sense whatsoever. The government side was accusing us of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247949">We kept standing up and saying we did not want to delay it but we wanted to get some improvement. We wanted to get it improved to the point where it was as close as possible to the bill we already agreed on. If we could get that far, we were prepared to support it even if it did not contain all the changes we wanted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247950">However, because of the tenacity of the official opposition in refusing to let go of that issue and in refusing to allow ourselves to be browbeaten into supporting something we did not want to, we were being accused of unfairly holding things up. That argument does not hold a lot of water, given the fact that most of what we were seeking in those previous debates is now here in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247951">We have an opportunity today to make an even greater improvement, and that is a good thing. What would be even better is if the government would take seriously the review of the entire military justice system and not just do it piecemeal. This is not just us. There are judges—and I will probably get a chance to read the quote in a response. This is coming from our jurors, our judges, saying that we should not do it in a piecemeal way, that we would better serve the defence of Canada and the soldiers who staff it if we did an entire review, wall to wall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247952">The government did not do it. It did not even bring in all the recommended changes from the first review. It received another review. It was tabled in June 2012, and there was no response to that one. Interestingly it took the government six months to table it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247953">Then a year later there is still nothing done. It raises the question of how serious the government is. We had to drag it, kicking and screaming, to this point, where we could protect the future of our soldiers through their not having criminal records. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247954">I do not know why the parliamentary secretary is laughing at that. I do not see anything humorous in it. I did not mean it to be humorous. I was pointing out the importance and severity of the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247955">Finally, the official opposition is now at a point where, reluctantly, it will support the bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247956">There has been no artificial delay. We said we would not pass the bill because it did not have these components and in particular this one here, the criminal records. We focused on it. We said so over and over, to the point where the government accused us of just deliberately delaying for some unknown reason. The government accused us of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247957">However, we did not blink. We said no. The government could use its majority and ram it through; we could not stop it, but make no mistake, at every opportunity we had, we would not fast-track the bill. We would not let it go through any more quickly than necessary. We were going to stand up and keep making these points under the leadership of our defence critic, and that is what we did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247958">It is always a bit risky. However, at the end of the day, the government came to its senses enough to realize that, by acquiescing, it not only solved a bit of its problem with the party opposite it in the House, but I would like to think it also realized that this is in the best interests of our soldiers. That is who the legal system is there to serve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247959">Remember, we are a country where one is innocent until proven guilty. We respect so greatly the rights that individuals have. The government accuses us of being soft on crime and all this stuff. This is the same application. All we in the official opposition are saying is that there are ordinary citizens who voluntarily join and offer up, ultimately, their lives to the service of defending this country and its people. They deserve better than a piecemeal approach to reviewing the military justice system; they deserve better than a government just accusing the opposition of not caring enough; and they deserve better than to see it take so long for some justice to actually be brought to our military justice system.</ParaText>

Why is the NDP favouring this amendment to an article of the bill whose version in the previous Parliament, in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, it was prepared to accept? What is it in the tenacity of the NDP that leads it to invent a principle, invent a commitment that it never showed in committee, in this Parliament or the previous Parliament, at the last minute, and put up a number of speakers today to delay debate on a point that is now suddenly important to it, which we have never heard it speak on before, in four parliaments?

              <ParaText id="3247965">Mr. Speaker, one of the issues on the amendment that has come up from time to time is what I call a bogus issue of the live fire exception: that somehow the VCDS—not the commanding officer, not the guy in the field—will know that there is potentially a live fire operation. When it is the VCDS sitting in Ottawa, the guy who tells the chief of police—that is, the Provost Marshal—what to do and not the investigators in the field, the real worry here is other types of investigations. What about detainee issues in Afghanistan? What about the incident that occurred when our committee was in Afghanistan, when the commanding officer was charged with conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline and sent home because of an inappropriate fraternization with another officer? What about potential interference with those things?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3247968">Mr. Speaker, my first thought is how lucky we are in the official opposition to have such a fantastic defence critic who understands these issues so well. I am not a lawyer, not everyone here is. I am a layperson so I bring whatever practical experience and knowledge, as well as tapping into expertise. However, I listened to the hon. member point out in a very short period of time the flaws in the one example that the Conservatives stand on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247969"> Is that not what people do when they do not have a really good argument? I have done it myself, so I know it works. They take one good issue and put it down on the ground and just stand on that one little thing and do not move. That is their one position. That one example is not nearly enough for us to be swayed to see this differently.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3247971">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, an act to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, and to speak to the amendments made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247972">Let me begin by underscoring the fact that there are many important reforms in the bill, and the NDP will be somewhat reluctantly supporting this long, overdue update to the military justice system when it comes up for a vote at report stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247973">That being said, New Democrats also recognize that the legislation is just a first step, with much more left to accomplish to effect the type of change we are seeking for Canada's military justice system. Members of the Canadian Forces are held to an extremely high standard of discipline, and they in turn deserve a judicial system that is held to a comparable standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247974">At its core, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is similar to the version of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, which came out of committee in the 40th Parliament. However, important amendments passed at committee stage in the last Parliament were not included by the government in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. One such omission was the failure to include a measure to broaden the list of offences removed from the consequences of a criminal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247975">Most Canadians would be shocked to learn that the people who bravely serve our country can receive a criminal record from a system that lacks the due process usually required in civilian criminal courts, which is why New Democrats fought relentlessly to ensure that the necessary changes were made to streamline and modernize Canada's military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247976">When Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> was first presented in October 2011, New Democrats immediately recognized the deficiencies of the bill and set to work, both in the House and at committee, to ensure the legislation was the best it possibly could be to achieve the goal of modernizing Canada's military justice system. My colleagues at committee pressed for the necessary changes and amendments to reduce the effect of disciplinary offences, of possible criminal records, and challenge the failure of the legislation to grant full charter rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247977">Thanks to the hard work of New Democrats on the defence committee, particularly the member for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation>, the list of offences and the number of cases that will not attract a criminal record has been broadened and now account for approximately 95% of offences. New Democrats additionally fought to ensure that previously convicted CF members would actually have their records expunged. We also moved a series of amendments to improve the bill, demonstrating our commitment to reform. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247978">Some of the key amendments presented by my colleagues included: giving the Chief of Defence Staff the financial authority to compensate CF members in the grievance process; changing the composition of the grievance committee to include a 60% civilian membership and exclude active duty CF members, enhancing the independence of the board; a provision ensuring that a person who is convicted of an offence during a summary trial is not unfairly subjected to a criminal record; and clarifying the letter of the law, as recommended by Justice Lesage, to make it clear that a charge must be laid within a year of a service offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247979">In spite of all of the successful amendments that New Democrats were able to make at committee stage, we recognize that much still needs to be done to ensure that Canada's military justice system is the best that it can be. Some of the changes New Democrats would still like to see include conducting an independent wall-to-wall review of the military justice system, and providing a legislative response to the Lesage report within a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247980">Here the NDP stands with esteemed Justice Létourneau in calling for the Canadian government to end its one-off approach to amending the military justice system and to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of the entirety of the sections of the National Defence Act pertaining to the military justice system. In addition, the NDP is calling for the Conservative government to bring a legislative response to the Lesage report within one year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3247981">The members of the Canadian Forces deserve no less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247982">Let us look at the reforming of the summary trial system. Although some progress has been made, we believe that further reforms are necessary and a review of the summary trial system is required. Currently, a conviction of a service offence from a summary trial in the Canadian Forces may result in a criminal record without proper procedural fairness for the CF member. Summary trials are held without the ability of the accused to consult counsel. There are no appeals or transcripts of the trial, and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. This process can have an unduly harsh effect on the offender in question and lacks traditional judicial standards. New Democrats would like to see more reform in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247983">We would also like to see the expansion of the service offences exempted from receiving criminal records. The New Democrats understand that minor service offences should not lead to criminal records that impact CF members outside of their military duties. We fought for an expansion of these offences since Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> was first introduced and we will continue fighting on behalf of the service men and women whose post-military lives could be affected by minor service offences that result in criminal records.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247984">We need to reform the grievance system. A major flaw in the military grievance system is that the Chief of Defence Staff presently lacks the authority to resolve any and all financial claims arising from a grievance, contrary to a recommendation in the Lamer report. Despite the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> agreed to this recommendation eight years ago, the matter is still not resolved. The New Democrats believe that the minister should finally implement this recommendation at the earliest possible date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247985">We also believe that the government needs to strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> gives the Vice Chief of Defence Staff authority to direct military police investigations. This measure is inconsistent with existing arrangements in the accountability framework as a clear violation of maintaining the independence of the Military Police Complaints Commission. Allowing the chain of command to interfere with military police investigations is an irresponsible measure that flies in the face of the harsh lessons learned from the Somalia inquiry. Past and present chairs of the Military Police Complaints Commission have stated as much. Come 2015, the New Democrats will work to make the changes necessary to ensure the full independence of the MPCC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3247986">In conclusion, with colleagues such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170509" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>, and their continuing commitment to military families and our veterans, Canadians can be assured that the NDP will continue fighting to bring more fairness to the Canadian military justice system for the members of our armed forces who put their lives on the line for the service of Canada each and every day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248004">Mr. Speaker, it is ironic to me that the opposition, both official and otherwise, is basically saying that this is good and is a move forward but that it is not perfect and could be better, and here is a small way in which it could be made better. Yet we get this wall of resistance to what is ultimately a relatively minor change. This is what happens in committee. This is what happens here. We get this bizarre system of ridicule, which makes it very hard to support the government, even when, by the operation of random luck, it actually gets it right, or mostly right. </ParaText>

It lets him or her tell the police that this is where they go, this is where they do not, and this is how to conduct its investigation. It is a pretty serious issue. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="170207" Type="2">Mr. Alexandre Boulerice (Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3248010">Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> on military justice once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248011">I would like to begin by saying a few words about what was truly an excellent week for the official opposition, the NDP. Yesterday evening, speaking of justice, one of our colleagues succeeded in getting a bill on sexual identity and the protection of transsexual and transgender people passed. Congratulations! That was a good example of our New Democratic values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248012">We also put forward a motion on science, which the Conservatives rejected. We revealed the truth about the Conservative government: it does not like science, rational thought or facts. We already knew that, but now we have incontrovertible proof. What a victory for the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248013">Now, with this bill, thanks to the hard work of my New Democratic colleagues in committee and in the House, we have persuaded the government to listen to reason and we have improved this bill, which, initially, was deeply flawed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248014">This is a step in the right direction, and I am very proud of the NDP's work. The official opposition has made things better and ensured greater respect for the men and women who defend our country and serve in the armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248015">There is room for improvement in this bill. The government waited too long. We need a comprehensive overhaul of the military police justice system. Unfortunately, the Conservative government has dragged its feet. It has made small changes here and there that do not meet the needs of the men and women of our armed forces. It has refused to adopt a comprehensive approach that would solve all of the problems at once.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248016">Justice Lamer's report came out in 2003, and it is now 2013. That means that these recommendations have been pending for 10 years, over several Parliaments. Both Liberal and Conservative governments have dragged their feet, proving that even though they claim it is a priority, they do not have much respect for the men and women who serve in the Canadian armed forces. Sadly, their actions prove that this is not a priority. There is also the issue of respect for our veterans, which comes up often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248017">The official opposition is often accused of not liking the armed forces. The Conservatives often make somewhat dishonest, vicious and mean attacks in that respect. The NDP's work in this area shows how rigorous we are and how much we respect the people who serve in Canada's armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248018">We ask a lot of them. We often ask them to sacrifice their family life, to go abroad and put themselves in extremely dangerous situations where they risk not only getting hurt, but also losing their lives. We cannot ask these Canadians and these Quebeckers to give so much unless we, as a country, as a government, as legislators, put in place a set of mechanisms that will ensure that they are treated with respect, fairness and compassion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248019">More and more countries are thinking about how to ensure that the military justice system in large part respects human rights and international conventions. Thanks to pressure from my NDP colleagues, we managed to improve the situation of our soldiers. Since we are asking so much of them, we must give them back as much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248020">As the representative of the people of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, I believe it is important to move in the right direction. That is what we have done and what we are continuing to do here today. I say this in anticipation of the parliamentary secretary's question when I finish my speech in 10 minutes. Our successful work means that 95% of disciplinary code breaches no longer lead to a criminal record. That progress is in large part responsible for the fact that the NDP caucus is now united in supporting Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248021">At the time, I remember rising in the House and making much more critical comments, because there had not been amendments, which were made later.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3248022">We had a problem with the current system because relatively minor disciplinary infractions left a permanent mark on the lives of these people, who are often relatively young when they retire from the armed forces and who have a career after leaving. Members can imagine how difficult it can be for them to find a new job, new occupation or new profession, especially if their military criminal record, resulting from a breach of conduct or bad behaviour when they were members of the Canadian armed forces, follows them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248023">It was unfair. This hung a millstone around people's necks and put them at a disadvantage for the rest of their careers. However, we fought for them. We stood strong. We argued. The members of the committee did their work. Our excellent defence critic led the fight on this. Today, given the improvements made to this bill, the NDP caucus will support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248024">The amendments made to clause 75, which pertains to criminal records, are a great victory for the NDP. That is why I started my speech by talking about our recent victories, which always make us happy, despite the fact that we are dealing with a majority government that rarely listens to parliamentarians or Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248025">That is not all. I also wanted to point out that the NDP fought to ensure that many members of the Canadian Forces who have already been convicted can have their criminal records erased. This is not simply for the future; it also rights past and present wrongs. That was very important to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248026">We also moved a series of amendments to improve the bill in order to show our commitment to our men and women in uniform, as well as to a more comprehensive reform of the system that would make it possible to implement a more logical, consistent and respectful structure. For example, we suggested giving the Chief of the Defence Staff the financial authority to compensate members of the Canadian Forces as part of a grievance resolution process. This is found in the amended version of clause 6 of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, in direct response to a recommendation made by Justice Lamer 10 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248027">We also want to make changes to the composition of the grievance resolution committee to include 60% civilian membership and to not include active members of the Canadian Forces. This was the amended clause 11 of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, which would help make the committee more independent. These changes are important to us, because there is a problem with the current system, in that the judge is both judge and jury. The danger of being judged by one's peers is that they are involved. We believe the judicial process must be independent to protect the rights of the accused. That is a basic judicial principle that is generally applied in civilian society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248028">We think that the process should be made more civil, in the sense that more civilians should be involved in the process so that people who are directly involved do not end up judging their subordinates, especially in cases of insubordination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248029">We also proposed a clause to ensure that a person convicted of an offence during a summary trial is not unfairly subjected to a criminal record. This is the bill's famous clause 75.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248030">The NDP also proposed that we guarantee the independence of the police by abolishing subsections 18.5(1) to 18.5(5), in clause 4 of the bill, to prevent the Chief of Defence Staff from issuing specific instructions on an investigation to the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal. Once again, this is a matter of independence, respect and the basic principle of justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248031">Lastly, we asked for precisions regarding the letter of the law, as recommended by Justice LeSage, to indicate that a charge must be laid within a year after the offence was committed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248032">This concludes my speech to show how much the NDP—the official opposition—cares about this issue. We care about the men and women who defend our country, who bear arms and who risk their lives. They do their job, and we—in the NDP and in the opposition—do ours too, in their best interests and in the best interests of all Canadians. </ParaText>

However, before there is too much back-patting, I want to note that the NDP has in some respects moved the debate forward in terms of a simple and elegant way of dealing with the very subject that the hon. member spoke to, namely, the disconnect between the severity of the offence and the actual service offences.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248056">After reading what happened in committee, I was not surprised to see that they took this path, which does not do justice to the file we are debating. The majority of those who have spoken in the House have said that this is not the first time this has been studied during a parliament. However, it could be said that this is being used as an aggravating factor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248057">It is clear that, on a number of occasions, federal parliaments have decided that changes needed to be made to military justice.

Out of gratitude as well as justice to these soldiers, Bill C-15 should be first aimed at protecting their rights, not creating more bureaucracy, military lawyers, and military judges. It should be written from the perspective of soldiers and their commanders, not the military legal staff serving in the safe enclave of National Defence Headquarters. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3248067">I have been hearing a bitter undertone to these criticisms even though the debate should touch on as many aspects as possible out of respect for the men and women who sacrifice themselves, dedicate themselves and do things on a daily basis that very few of us would do. They risk their lives in defence of our values. They deserve more than a petty debate that cannot seem to get past the comments and insults that I have read about people who gave their lives. I am astounded at how some Conservative members treated some of the witnesses, including Colonel Drapeau, by accusing them of just trying to sell books.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248068">Back to the amendments. I would like to go off on a tangent because even though I am not an expert on the subject, this issue is important to me. Many of the people who live in the riding of Gatineau work for the armed forces. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248069">Yesterday evening, I was reading testimony to prepare for this and become more informed about the subject, knowing full well that I would be hearing the outraged and sometimes outrageous remarks of my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="170866" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. Life is full of coincidences. I realized that one of the witnesses who appeared before the committee was a former law school classmate, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Marie Dugas. I would like to give him my regards. He came to talk about his experience as a lawyer and as the director of the Canadian Forces Defence Lawyers. I would also like to congratulate him on the work he has done defending the rights of these people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248070">The Green Party amendments were not pulled out of thin air. The <Affiliation DbId="170866" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> may have been ignorant of the facts or may have failed to understand, when he said that the NDP never suggested any amendments. That is false and insulting and not the case at all. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170172" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> was absolutely right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248071">The good thing about the NDP's proposed amendment is that it was based on something even better than what the Green Party amendment attempts to do. It was based on the recommendation of the Military Police Complaints Commission. That is exactly what the NDP suggested. The commission recommended removing the section in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248072">However, as we know, and I see it all the time at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, government bills are often so badly written and fundamentally flawed that we know they will wind up in court one day. We would like to be able to delete clauses, but we all know that we cannot. They cannot be deleted simply because they go beyond the scope of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248073">When these kinds of amendments are proposed, we are told that they cannot be presented. We have to proceed as our Green Party colleague did and introduce an amendment that makes the bill a little more palatable, although not perfect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248074">I probably will not have time to repeat everything that the Military Police Complaints Commission had to say about the famous new subsection 18.5(3) in clause 4, the subject of the Green Party member's amendments. Basically, the Commission believes that there is a problem in the clause related to the independence of operations and accountability. We would have preferred that the clause be deleted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248075">I highly commend the NDP members who sit on the Standing Committee on National Defence. I commend them for their patience. They were subjected to a number of unpleasant and mean-spirited comments. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170207" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> mentioned this earlier.

We want to avoid such interference. The parliamentary secretary gave examples of investigators that could find themselves in the middle of a conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248078">I would like the hon. member to better define the concept of interference. I think that there is a distinction to be made between a situation in which a commander tells someone that this may not be the best time to conduct an investigation without necessarily being able to say why and one in which he gives instructions and interferes in an investigation.

I will avoid doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248080">Since my colleague has presented me with the opportunity, I would like to quote the commission. The commission said that it does not take issue with the general supervisory role of the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff—the VCDS—vis-à-vis the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal—the CFPM—set out in subsection 18.5(1), nor with the authority of the VCDS to issue general instructions to the CFPM in respect of the discharge of his responsibilities. The problem arises when those instructions start to interfere in cases. Then it comes dangerously close to interference. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248081">The government's problem is that it did not make a distinction. The government is not detail-oriented, which is not a compliment. This is a bad habit that would be in the government's best interest to break, particularly when it comes to such important portfolios that affect our men and women in the Canadian Forces. These people give of themselves to serve our country and I think that we should try to stick as closely as possible to the principles of justice, fair play, natural justice and equality before the law. There is not necessarily any evidence of that in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, at least not as much as there should be.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248087">We did better.

The NDP called for the clause to be removed completely. That would be a very smart amendment to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248088">However, the amendment was not in order because it went beyond the scope of the bill. It could have been accepted by the government opposite. Just because an amendment is not procedurally in order does not mean that we cannot continue. It makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248089">I argued before the commission about this clause. The commission feels that it would be best to remove the clause. That is what should have been done.

The Weedon we know today, which is part of Quebec's relay-village network, is the result of an amalgamation of four entities in the 1990s: Saint-Gérard, Fontainebleau, the township of Weedon and the village of Weedon. The people of this region have shown courage, bravery and tenacity in the face of socio-economic challenges over the past few decades.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248362">In the meantime, I can tell hon. members with certainty that with that objective of job creation in mind, economic action plan 2013 will not contain the NDP's risky proposals to hurt our economy and job creation. It will not include, for example, a tax hike on Canadian job creators, the one that was advocated by the leader of the NDP when he was on his visit to Washington arguing against Canadian jobs, a tax hike that Canadian manufacturers and exporters have said would cost 200,000 Canadian jobs off the top just in their sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248363">The budget will not include the over $56 billion in reckless past NDP spending proposals and, of course, our economic action plan will not include the NDP's signature initiative, its $21 billion carbon tax, a concept that has already been rejected by Canadians. We will undoubtedly hear about these differences in priorities over the course of the four days of the budget debate, which our rules provide. Those days will be tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248372">I did do my Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal celebration on February 23, which consequently was also Black History Month. The reason I took note as a separate item of these distinguished medal recipients is precisely for the same reason we have a Black History Month. We have not yet reached the point where there is integration. Therefore, to celebrate the individual successes of Canadian blacks is important. It is important to commend that. I hope it is understood by the member opposite that is the spirit we have achieved. We will reach the point where it becomes our shared history, where we all embrace that aspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248373">In terms of the specific term used, I did counsel with the former curator of the North American Black Historical Museum to ensure that I was accurate both in the speech I gave on February 23 at home and also with respect to my statement in the House when recognizing members. I did want to be very sensitive to that, so I hope the member understands there was no intention of any type of a slight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248374">This is a major celebration for all walks of life, but I thought it was appropriate because it was Black History Month. I did counsel with those who would have knowledge, including one of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal recipients I spoke of, Ms. Elise Harding-Davis, who is a very well-noted expert on black history in Canada, a history going back as well to fugitive slaves and underground railroad history. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248380">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to continue speaking to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248381">Before question period, I explained that this bill had been introduced during the 40th Parliament, and that it had been studied. Some changes proposed by the opposition parties had even been adopted. Unfortunately, the government did not do its homework before reintroducing Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, which means that we had to debate it all over again. I know that the <Affiliation DbId="170866" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> complained during debate at second reading that we were debating these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248382">I would also like to remind him that in the House, not only must we debate bills, but we must also explain to Canadians the issue being discussed. It was only through that debate and the fact that the opposition was in a position to put forward all those factors, that the government backed down and accepted the amendments in order to improve the bill. Unfortunately, although we said that this bill was a step in the right direction, it includes one point that is still problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248383">I heard the parliamentary secretary ask a number of times this morning why the NDP is speaking today when it did not raise these questions in committee. However, that is not the case. Our position is clear. We raised it in committee; we discussed it. The Conservatives hold the majority in the House and in committees. They choose what they want to accept and they have accepted certain amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248384">I am thinking in particular about criminal records for members of the Canadian Forces. For someone who wants a normal life after having served his country, having a criminal record has some very negative repercussions. I remember rising here in the House to push the issue. We are happy that the government listened to us, that it listened to the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248385">However, it backtracked on aspects that had been agreed upon during the 40th Parliament. Turning back specifically to the Military Police Complaints Commission, the MPCC, we are asking that the commission be truly independent. The proposal set out in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> has a negative impact. This bill gives the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff the authority to establish guidelines and to issue instructions regarding police investigations. We also feel that has an impact on the terms set out in the current accountability framework and that it goes against the principle of independence. We feel it is a type of interference, which his problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248386">Glenn Stannard, chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission, raised this point when he testified before committee. I am not going to reread what he said, but I would like to make it clear that people will trust the independence of the military police when it is truly independent and when there is no interference. That is important. Again, when we say that we respect our military personnel and that they are important, we also must make sure that we have the best possible system in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248387">That is why we are rising today. We are standing up for a better military justice system because the members on this side of the House have a great deal of respect for our men and women in uniform who have served and are still serving our country, and I know that the members opposite do as well. In fact, all members of the House have a great deal of respect for them. However, we must respect them not only when they are working to represent us but also once their work is complete. It is our turn, as legislators, to ensure that they have all the tools they need, to ensure that those tools are in their best interest and to support them in their return to civilian life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248388">Peter Tinsley, former chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission, testified in committee as an individual, and he supports the NDP's position.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3248389">He said that Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is a step in the right direction. However, he also said that the independence of the police, recognized by the Supreme Court in 1999, is also a problem. The provision we are talking about right now, namely, subsection 18.5(3) of the bill, violates the judicial independence recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1999 as a fundamental principle underlying the rule of law. What is more, the subsection deviates from the norm with regard to the relationship between the police and the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248390">That is why we are rising today. This morning, the <Affiliation DbId="170868" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> repeated the same question several times. He was trying to find out why the NDP did not rise. I would like to answer him by saying that this was something that we raised in committee and that was put forward. Some progress was made on the issue and the government agreed to certain amendments, but there is a problem with this provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248391">The motions moved by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> are a step in the right direction, but they are not exactly what we wanted. However, we know that, at this stage, these motions will allow us to move forward. That is why we are discussing this subject. It is important to debate it in the House. We have seen that this can have a positive effect because the government can learn from what is happening and move in the right direction.</ParaText>

The government clearly sees that the opposition is highlighting the issues, proposing amendments and trying to work to make the legislation the best it can be. He clearly said, "in the best interest of military justice". That is what we are trying to do and what we are trying to propose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248396">Unfortunately, when we arrived with some very reasonable amendments that the government could have accepted, they rejected them.

              <ParaText id="3248406">Justice Antonio Lamer's authority was well established, and the government had every reason to take the former chief justice's many recommendations into account. To a certain extent, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is a response to those concerns. However, because it does not go far enough, we proposed amendments in committee. One of our amendments was agreed to, but the others were rejected, unfortunately. Nevertheless, we are pleased that Bill C-15 was improved enough for us to be able to support it at third reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248407">By way of context, it is important to note that our military justice system operates separately from our criminal justice system because our military personnel play a special role in our society. Because of their role, they have certain special powers that ordinary citizens do not. Along with that, they have to comply with very high disciplinary standards related to the hierarchy and organization of the military system on the ground so that they can respond effectively during military operations. A lot of very structured preparatory work also has to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248408">There is a very specific way in which the military justice system must answer to that structure, which is separate from society. The system must be held to very high standards and must not needlessly trap veterans and former members of the Canadian Forces after they have finished serving. They find themselves trapped in needless uncertainty because of mistakes they made that, normally, would not result in a criminal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248409">We can be pleased with the fact that, in committee, the NDP was able to get a major amendment passed, which changed nearly 95% of disciplinary code infractions so that they will no longer result in a criminal record.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3248410">That is the main reason we are now supporting Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248411">As everyone knows, a criminal record comes with very unpleasant consequences. For example, a criminal record can keep a member from starting a new life and pursuing a second career, a career that could be limited by the member's inability to travel to the United States or to fulfill certain duties that he is qualified for because of his military experience and training. The fact that it is so easy to have a criminal record after spending one's life in the armed forces is a major irritant and totally unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248412">I mentioned two reports, one by Justice Antonio Lamer and one by a Senate committee. However, we would have liked the government to respond more quickly, and we want it to respond with tangible measures to the report by the former Ontario Superior Court Chief Justice LeSage. He also completed a study on the National Defence Act, which he presented to the government in December 2011. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> does not really cover that, which is very unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248413">Another aspect is rather ironic. I am currently a member of the Standing Committee on Finance. We recently examined Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document>, a huge and very technical bill that makes changes to some aspects of the Canadian tax system. Instead of a gradual, piecemeal approach, we would have liked to see a more major reform, although not a massive one that would make it impossible to study the military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248414">I was a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and I noticed a very similar approach when it was time to change some details in the Criminal Code. There was a real lack of vision, which is truly appalling. Our soldiers, who fulfill a very important and admirable role, both in Canada and around the globe, should definitely not be victims nor should they be subjected to such improvisation on the government's part. It is really appalling. Our soldiers would be much better off if the military justice system had the same or similar standards as the civilian justice system, since this would bring us in line with other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248415">When the NDP forms the government in 2015, our party will be committed to doing more to make a real difference, which will allow us to offer all members of our armed forces a justice system worthy of that name and, above all, worthy of the appearance of justice earned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248416">That is probably the most important aspect, and the final point I wanted to make. Ensuring the appearance of justice is a fundamental principle of our justice system. This appearance is especially fundamental because it forms the basis of public confidence and, therefore, the confidence of members of the armed forces in the military justice machine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248417">I hope the government has listened to our hopes and wishes. I thank the government again for accepting a fundamental amendment regarding the consequences of possibly getting a criminal record.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248427">Mr. Speaker, it appears that the government cannot take yes for an answer.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3248435">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, which would amend the National Defence Act to strengthen military justice. This is following a couple of studies and papers put forward, one in 2003 and one in 2009. The 2009 report was of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248436">Among other things, the bill would provide greater flexibility in the sentencing process. It would provide for additional sentencing options. It would include absolute discharges for minor offences, intermittent sentences and restitution. It would modify the composition of a court martial panel in accordance with the rank of the accused person. It would modify the limitation period applicable to summary trials and would allow an accused person to waive the limitation periods. It would clarify the responsibilities of the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal and would make amendments to the delegation of the Chief of the Defence Staff's powers as the final authority in the grievance process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248437">As we heard earlier today, the New Democrats are supportive of this legislation because it would be a step forward. Unfortunately, and perhaps anticipating a question from the parliamentary secretary from <Affiliation DbId="170437" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation>, why take one step when we could take two, three, four or more steps? It has been a pattern with the current government in legislation that comes forward. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170437" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> is a very intelligent and well-spoken man, and I am sure he understands more steps could be taken but is unwilling to take them. Perhaps in the question period we will have an opportunity to hear from the member about why he will not take that extra step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248438">For the most part, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> would be a step in the right direction. However, as we have heard from other speakers, it could go further. Let me speak to a couple of amendments that are coming forward at report stage from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248439">There are two amendments, and although they are not perfect, they could be amendments that need to be discussed. Canadians expect us to be in this place, to work in committees and to make legislation the best it can possibly be. That means putting forward amendments. Sometimes the amendments are not perfect, but if an amendment is not perfect as put forward, it should be the responsibility of the committee, and in particular of the parliamentary secretary on that committee, to ensure that there could be a counter-amendment, or other amendments or things that could make the legislation better in almost every instance as it comes before the committee. Canadians expect us to do that. Therefore, I hope these amendments from the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands, which I will briefly outline, will be considered in the light in which they were given, which is to improve the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248440">The member put forward two amendments at report stage regarding proposed subsections 18.5(3) and 18.5(5) of the National Defence Act. Clause 4, which would add section 18.5 to the National Defence Act, would give the Chief of the Defence Staff authority to direct military police investigations. The Green Party's amendments would amend that section of the act, which the NDP targeted as problematic and attempted to amend without success during committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248441">The second amendment put forward by the member is a measure that would increase the transparency of this problematic authority that would be given to the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff by Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. While this amendment would be an improvement, we strongly believe that granting the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff this authority could be a violation of maintaining the independence of the Military Police Complaints Commission, so we will be looking at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248442">When these amendments are put forward, we and all Canadians expect both opposition and government members of the committee to look at them, take them in the spirit in which they were brought forward and deal with them in an appropriate manner to make the legislation better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248443">What we as the opposition are hoping for, and what I hope the government members are also interested in with this bill, is to come up with a fairer military justice system. That is the bottom line on Bill C-15. It could be fairer than the final product is likely going to be, and it would be nice to have gone that extra step forward. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3248444">There are many important reforms in the bill, and the NDP supports this long overdue update to the military justice system. Members of the Canadian armed forces are held to a very high standard. In turn, they deserve a judicial system that is also of a very high standard. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to understand that this is a step forward, although there could be another step and another step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248445">Let us briefly talk about, in the time I have left, five items that either need to be looked at or that are included in the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248446">The first thing, and maybe one of the most important, is conducting an independent wall-to-wall review of the military justice system and providing a legislative response to the LeSage report within the year. One of the things that has not happened is a wall-to-wall review. Recently, a recently retired judge of the Federal Court of Appeal and Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada, Gilles Létourneau, outlined the need for such a review. Therefore, there are still things that will need to be done moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248447">A reform of the summary trial system is another thing. Currently, a conviction of a service offence from a summary trial in the Canadian Forces may result in a criminal record without the proper procedural fairness for the Canadian Forces member. Summary trials are held without the ability of the accused to consult counsel. There are no appeals or transcripts of the trial and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. These are things that will be looked at as we move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248448">Another item is expanding the service offences exempted from receiving criminal records. There are a number of minor service offences that result in criminal records right now and I believe this will be expanded by about 95%. That is certainly a good thing. I do not think that the military term is “goldbricking", but I know there is an official term and perhaps the parliamentary secretary will help me out with that in the questions. However, offences such as that should not lead to criminal records as often happens outside of the military duties of the Canadian Forces members. Certainly, outside of the Canadian Forces, it would not be an issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248449">In my remaining time, let me talk about strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission. I know, again, that the parliamentary secretary will have a comment on this. While a lot of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is a step forward, it does not move forward enough. Elements of clause 4 regarding the complaints commission are a clear step backward within the military justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248450">I have been listening to the debate over the course of today and the parliamentary secretary was commenting to some of the other speakers about this particular issue. The reason I am bringing it up at the end is that we might have an opportunity to speak to it further. He will probably be concerned about why we did not say or do anything about it earlier in the process of the bill. We moved amendments earlier in committee on Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> to remove the power to interfere with military investigations. This was after listening to the testimony of a number of witnesses. We opposed that power then and we still oppose it. However, we do support the bill on the whole because it is a step forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248451">This is a dilemma that we have had since 2006 with the government putting forward legislation that may have something in it that would not allow us to vote for it in all good conscience. The government may also put something into a bill where it could have gone further and taken the steps necessary to make it good legislation, perhaps legislation that would not be challenged in court at a later date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248452">I want to emphasize that we do support Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, but it certainly could have been better.</ParaText>

It was not raised in the 78 often repetitive, to be very honest, speeches by him and his colleagues at second reading. It was not raised in the 40th Parliament. It did not even feature among the amendments brought forward at report stage in the 40th Parliament where we were in a minority position and the NDP had much more influence over the shape of the bill.

              <ParaText id="3248462">I would be interested in the hon. member's speculations as to why the government is putting up such bizarre reasons for what many argue is a simple fix.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248463">Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the government has a piecemeal approach to these sorts of things, and it is not just this bill but all kinds of other bills. I cannot speak on those before 2008, but almost every bill that has come before the House in this Parliament and the Parliament before are piecemeal, rather than having one comprehensive bill come forward and everybody is standing in this House when it comes time to vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248464"> If it were ever deserved by this government, I would be happy to say, “Thanks very much; that is a fabulous bill and I support it”. Unfortunately, the best I can do in this particular case of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, and just about every other bill the government has put forward, is to say, “That is an interesting attempt from the Conservative government, but why did it not go that needed step further to make legislation of which we and all Canadians could be proud?”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248465">Mr. Speaker, I do not have a lot of time for my speech, since it is getting late and there is an important speech coming up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248466">The parliamentary secretary has been repeating the same question since early this afternoon. I just want to point out to him that the NDP proposed 22 amendments and 5 subamendments to improve this bill in committee. We are not talking about one or two amendments. It was 22 amendments and 5 subamendments. How many of these amendments were approved? Not a single one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248467">We worked very hard to get one amendment passed, and this amendment is essential to our support of this bill. This amendment was eventually presented by the Conservatives. We worked very hard to ensure that members of the armed forces do not end up with criminal records.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248468">This bill is very important, even though it is a long time coming. The bill responds to reports dating back to 2003, as my colleagues mentioned earlier. They made some excellent speeches and showed that this bill does a lot of good and that it represents a good step forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248469">I would like to talk about the important point that the NDP gained, because we work very hard in the House and in committee. As a result of our hard work, 95% of disciplinary code breaches will not lead to a criminal record, as was the case previously. That is thanks to the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248470">That is why we will support this bill. We worked hard in committee, did our homework and were on the front line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248471">As I mentioned, we proposed 22 amendments and five subamendments to improve this bill. Unfortunately, the Conservatives voted against them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248472">We are very proud to have managed to get the main amendment. Our Canadian Forces are people who sacrifice their lives and sometimes ruin their family lives to serve our beautiful country and its people. When they leave the Canadian Forces, they do not deserve to have a criminal record for breaches that are not serious or are minor, and for which they would not receive a criminal record in the civilian system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248473">For that reason, I will say that this bill is a step forward. However, I would like to tell the parliamentary secretary who just rose a number of times to tell us that we are not doing serious work, that the opposite is true. We are doing serious work. We proposed 22 amendments and five subamendments in committee. The parliamentary secretary voted against all those measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248474">We finally have a bill that we managed to improve. We are very proud of it. We are very pleased with it. We will not give up, and we will continue on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248475">Some people had some doubts earlier, but it is true that we will be in power in 2015. It is true that we will do what needs to be done in 2015 to have a true democracy and adopt budgets that do not come in an omnibus package and that can be studied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248476">That is how things will go in 2015. The budgets would be proposed in committee and will be studied as they should.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248484">Mr. Speaker, I rise to present Canada's economic action plan 2013, a plan for jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248485">Canada is in an enviable position among the world's industrial economies. We have fared relatively better than most in the aftermath of the worst recession in a generation. As many of our allies and trading partners continue to struggle, we are well placed to prosper. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248486">We have a lot to be proud of: today we find ourselves further ahead than any other G7 country when it comes to creating jobs and economic growth; further ahead than any other since 2006 when it comes to income growth; and further ahead than any other when it comes to our debt to GDP ratio. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248487">Now we stand among just a handful of nations the world over with our AAA credit rating, and Government of Canada securities are among the world's most sought-after investments. This means that investors here and abroad are confident in our government's ability to manage the economy now and into the future by sticking to the long-term view and by taking strong, decisive actions whenever it has been required. We have grown stronger, even as many have weakened. It is imperative that we continue along this path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248488">Make no mistake; there are still significant risks ahead. The global economy is still fragile, and some of our biggest trading partners are among the worst affected. This makes our job more difficult, but it is also clear to the world that Canada has picked the right path and the right plan, a responsible plan for jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248489">Today we outline a course of action in keeping with all of our work so far. It builds on a legacy of success. It is an intentional, consistent plan that we have implemented with firm commitment from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248490">This plan takes action in three important areas. It introduces the Canada job grant, a bold new initiative to transform the way we provide skills training to ensure we connect Canadians with available jobs. It introduces a new building Canada plan, the largest and longest federal investment in building roads, bridges and public transit in Canadian history. It also introduces a plan to assist our manufacturers and other businesses as they innovate to compete in the global economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248491">Families are the building blocks of every nation and indeed the foundation on which Canada rests. The measures outlined in economic action plan 2013 build on our government's steadfast commitment to Canadian families. Much of what I announce today is aimed at making this country an even better place to raise a family, to work and to establish a business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248492">However, before I proceed, I need to make one thing very clear. It is simply this. Our government is committed to balancing the budget in 2015. In uncertain global economic times, the most important contribution a government can make to bolster confidence and growth in a country is to maintain a sound fiscal position. Every Canadian family knows that. When expenses outstrip income, the future of the whole family is at risk, and our government knows—even if some in the House do not—that no nation can borrow its way to long-term prosperity. We will not put the future of Canadian families at risk. We will not waiver from our commitment to create jobs and fill jobs for Canadians. We will not spend recklessly. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248494">We are also doing our part by looking inward. Our plan introduces measures, for example, to reduce spending on travel and to end duplication of internal government services.

              <ParaText id="3248495">We will not reduce transfers, whether it be transfers to individuals, children and seniors or transfers to provinces and territories for critical services like health care and education. In fact, we have increased funding for health care, education and other important social services by almost 50% since 2006, and funding for these important social programs will continue to rise each and every year our government is in power. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248496">We will not raise taxes, but new measures to close tax loopholes will help ensure that everyone pays their fair share. We will not back away from our steadfast commitment to fiscal responsibility. We will not balance the budget on the backs of hard-working Canadian families or those in need. However, we will balance the budget, and we will do it in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248497">Sir Clifford Sifton, who was a cabinet minister in Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government, had some good advice that still stands today. Sir Clifford wrote in a letter to his son, “In time of prosperity, prepare for trouble”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248498"> In 2006-2007, when few could foresee the magnitude of the trouble that was coming, we prepared. We cut taxes for families and for job-creating businesses. We paid down billions in national debt. We launched the building Canada plan to modernize roads, bridges and public transit in cities and communities across Canada.

              <ParaText id="3248499">For, when the crisis hit, Canada was in good shape relative to other nations. Our strong financial sector remained solid. Our reputation among investors remained strong. In 2009—the darkest days of the recession—we took quick and decisive action to stimulate the economy. In fact, we gave the economy a $64-billion shot in the arm. That, too, worked. Now, Canada is recognized around the world as a safe, stable place to invest. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248501">Abroad, our neighbours to the south and our European partners continue to face significant economic hurdles. Much of Europe—the world’s largest economy—is still in recession and needed reforms are not certain. The U.S. is burdened by massive debt and recovery is sluggish. As a result, the appetite for Canadian exports is unsteady.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248503">At home, we have concerns about the high level of household debt, and we have a significant challenge in the labour market. In fact, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business points out that one-third of its members say that a shortage of skilled labour is constraining growth. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has identified the skills shortage as the number one obstacle to the success of its members. I can see why. There are too many jobs that go unfulfilled in Canada because employers cannot find workers with the right skills. Meanwhile, there are still too many Canadians looking for work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248504">Do not get me wrong. Canada's workforce is among the very best in the world. As job creators, we have an enviable record. Not only have we recovered all the jobs lost during the recession, we have added almost half a million more. That is more than 950,000 jobs since the recovery began. These are overwhelmingly good, high-paying, full-time jobs in the private sector. In fact, more Canadians are employed than at any other time in our history. Yet I believe that we can and must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248505">Training in Canada is not sufficiently aligned to the skills employers need or to the jobs that are actually available. This means higher unemployment and slower economic growth than we should otherwise expect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248506">Unless we act now, this problem will be compounded as the recovery continues. Demographics are not on our side; the skills shortage will only get worse due to an aging population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248507">You might think this is just a problem for specific sectors like energy, mining or construction, or, specific regions like the west, but it is not. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248510">Matching the needs of employers with the training Canadians are getting is key to turning this trend around. Fortunately, by providing the right training, we can significantly reduce the mismatch between employers and job-seekers. That is why our government is taking bold, innovative steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248511">Today I am announcing the new Canada job grant. The Canada job grant would transform the way Canadians receive training. The Canada job grant could provide $15,000 or more, per person, to ensure that Canadians are getting the skills employers are seeking. Up to $5,000 would be provided by the federal government. To show their commitment, the employers would be required to provide matching funds. The province or territory would match the final third.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248512">For the first time, the Canada job grant would take skills training choices out of the hands of government and put them where they belong: in the hands of employers and Canadians who want to work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248518">Just as important as training is on-the-job experience. That is why today I am also announcing new measures to support apprentices. We would work with the provinces and territories to harmonize requirements for apprentices and would examine the use of practical tests as a method of assessment. Most importantly, we would ensure that government contracts and funding for infrastructure and maintenance would support the employment of apprentices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248519">For example, we would renew the investment in affordable housing agreements with the provinces and territories. By encouraging the use of apprentices, these agreements would help train young Canadians in the skilled trades with funding from these programs. For example, Habitat for Humanity has trained thousands of high-school and college students for the skilled trades.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3248524">As well, we will be making a three-year investment of $70 million to support 5,000 new paid internships so that new post-secondary graduates can obtain vital job experience. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248525">These new initiatives, and others announced today, will build on our commitment to Canada's young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248526"> In 2011, we expanded eligibility for student loans and grants. Right now there are more than 500,000 students benefiting from these programs. Last year's budget expanded our youth employment strategy by $50 million over two years. This has provided tens of thousands of young Canadians with the work experience and skills training needed to succeed in the job market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248527">Expanding educational opportunities and skills training would help Canada compete, but even these measures will not be enough. We must also look to the world for help. To that end, we would continue to reform our immigration system to make sure that Canada is the first choice for skilled workers from around the globe, that the best young people who come here to study could remain afterwards to try Canada out, that potential immigrants with the right skills could move to Canada faster, and that new Canadians could integrate quickly and find and keep good employment or start successful businesses that would add to Canada's prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248528">We would also introduce measures to ensure that first nations could fully participate in the economic opportunities that are available. We would work with the first nations to improve the on-reserve income assistance program to ensure that young recipients have the incentives necessary to gain employment. We would also continue to work with first nations to develop a first nations education act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248529">In addition, measures introduced today would further help Canadians with disabilities get the support they need to be active participants in the job market. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248530">As a former governor general Lord Tweedsmuir once observed, “Canada is a nation of bridges”.

Former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen knew that when he said, “Vigour, faith and enterprise are the only weapons with which any individual, any family, or any nation can face the future”. It is, indeed, the vigour and enterprise of Canadian individuals and families that have made this country great, and their faith, faith in their own dreams, resourcefulness and abilities, faith that their government will be a benign and silent partner in their enterprise and not an overwhelming behemoth squeezing them at every turn. Sadly, this is not a faith that all Canadian governments have kept, but ours has.</ParaText>

The minister said he would not cut transfers to provinces or individuals, yet he is plowing ahead with cuts to pensions, health care and EI and ignoring the serious threats facing our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248596">Let me make a point that has been recognized by the IMF, by the World Bank and by many economists around the world, which is that we cannot cut our way to growth. The deficit we are facing was not caused by government spending. Rather, it was the recession that caused the deficit, and curing the recession will lead to curing the deficit. Therefore, we need to be focused on jobs, improving wages and getting more taxes into the government coffers through better jobs and more employment—in other words, by putting people to work. There is no need to trample on government services or take serious austerity measures, which can simply make the recovery more difficult and make any downturn even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248597">We are concerned that the government is cutting the money that is going to infrastructure, because it is not taking inflation into account. I appreciate that inflation is low, but there is still an increase to the cost of living every year, and by the time this money is rolled out, it will mean a reduction of the moneys that have already been in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3248598">I appreciate that the minister has not been great in projecting growth targets—he missed his 2012 target by 35%—and we appreciate that we are in difficult global economic times that present serious challenges. However, we do not believe that the way forward is through austerity. It creates more insecurity. We believe the way forward is through strong job creation.</ParaText>
