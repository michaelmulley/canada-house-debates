                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That this House condemn the tax hikes introduced by the government in Budget 2013 on hospital parking, bicycles, baby strollers, coffee makers, iPods and other goods and services, which break the promise the government made to Canadians during the last election.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273924"> He said: Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on a motion that calls on this House to condemn the tax hikes introduced by the Conservative government in budget 2013. It raised taxes on hospital parking, bicycles, baby strollers, coffee makers, iPods and other goods and services, which, in our judgment, breaks the promise the government made to Canadians during the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273925">In that election, Conservatives ran on a pledge that there would be no new taxes. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “I give you my word: As long as I will be Prime Minister...there will be no new taxes”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273926">In the lead-up to the budget, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> reaffirmed that pledge and again promised Canadians that there would be no tax increases in this budget. In his 2013 budget speech, the minister said, “We will not raise taxes...”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273927">However, as noted, the budget is filled with hundreds of tax hikes on everything from hospital parking, credit unions and workers' funds, to bicycles, baby strollers, safety deposit boxes and the like. Apparently they both forgot this promise. The reality is that there are tax hikes, and they will cost Canadians nearly $8 billion over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273928">I should note at the outset that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170671" Type="2">Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273929">The Conservatives are raising taxes on over 1,200 types of goods, which will hit Canadians in their pocketbooks. These tax hikes will also hurt Canadian businesses, which will now find it harder to compete with their U.S. competitors as the cross-border price differential widens. The government should be supporting Canadian retailers, not forcing cash-strapped shoppers to head south of the border, which is a phenomenon many of us living in southern Canada see growing every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273930">Not content to simply raise prices on hundreds of goods, the Conservatives are trying to help their big corporate friends by attacking institutions that support working families, such as credit unions and workers' funds, with hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes. The Conservatives are unwilling to let anything escape taxation, and even increase taxes on those with safety deposit boxes to the tune of $150 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273931">I predict that we will be told by the Conservatives and their apologists that the new tariffs are not really taxes at all, and that therefore their promises have not been broken. However, hard-working taxpayers know the bottom line: they will have less in their pockets next year, if their incomes remain constant, than they will this year. That is the bottom line that Canadians will understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273932">In anticipation of this argument, I decided to look at some material that defines taxes. I went to the very reputable Canadian Tax Foundation's book, called <I>Tax Policy in Canada</I>, which was given to us at the finance committee not long ago. It defines tax as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273933">

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273934">It goes on to say:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273935">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Taxes are not the only source of government revenue.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273936">Indeed, in the Canadian Tax Foundation's <I>Tax Policy in Canada</I>, under “Principal Elements of the Canadian Tax System”, the first item is tariffs. It spends a lot of time talking about the historical importance of tariffs as important sources of revenue for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273937">Something I rarely do, and I suspect my colleagues on this side of the House rarely do as well, is quote the Fraser Institute. However, when the Fraser Institute referred to the Canadian Consumer Tax Index last year, it said the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273938">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Canadian Consumer Tax Index calculates the total tax bill paid by a Canadian family with average income by adding up the various taxes that the family pays to federal, provincial, and local governments. These include taxes such as income taxes, sales taxes, Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan contributions, as well as “hidden” taxes such as import duties, excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, amusement taxes, and gas taxes.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273939">The most drastic tax hikes in this budget are entitled “Modernizing Canada's General Preferential Tariff (GPT) Regime for Developing Countries”. This measure raises tariffs. We say it is a form of tax, agreeing with the Fraser Institute, on imports of 1,290 types of goods from 72 countries. These tariff hikes will raise the price on goods across the board, hurting consumers and retailers. The government is raising tariffs on over 80% of all imported types of goods from over 70 countries, and it is inevitable that Canadian consumers will feel the effect in their pocketbooks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273940">Canadian retailers are going to have to raise their prices as well. The tariff hikes are going to widen the Canada-U.S. tax gap. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273941">The government is trying to frame the general preferential tariff as a foreign aid program, but Canadians will not be fooled. Changes to the general preferential tariff are simply more tax hikes. According to industry sources, this will raise the price of affected imports by some 3%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273942">The Conservatives have trumpeted their $76 million in tax relief for sporting goods and baby clothes, but this is vastly outweighed by the tax hikes in the general preferential tariff. In their marketing of the budget, the Conservatives have made a virtue out of lowering tariffs on sporting goods and baby clothes in an effort to deflect attention from the massive increase in tariffs on 1,290 types of goods from 72 countries. That is what is going on. The GPT tax hike is going to generate $330 million a year, and by 2017-18 over $1 billion in total.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273943">What about the famous iPod tax? The Conservatives have told us that there is no such thing. I am indebted to Professor Moffatt of the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario, whose analysis can be found in <I>The Globe and Mail</I> and elsewhere. In his judgment, after admittedly tortuous analysis of a very complicated system of exemptions and tariffs, he concludes that there is such a thing as an iPod tax. Also buried in the long list of tariff hikes imposed by budget 2013 is a new 5% tax on MP3 players and iPods entering Canada. It is tariff category 85119.81.29. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273944"> This is a new Conservative iPod tax. They have claimed that music devices and iPods would not be subject to a tariff increase. Why? It is because it is a special exemption dating from 1987 for devices that are plugged into a computer. However, Professor Moffatt's analysis demonstrates that actually qualifying for that exemption is so onerous that it is unlikely any importer or retailer will be able to use it to avoid the new Conservative iPod tax. The Conservatives are just blowing smoke.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273945">Sony of Canada has warned that consumers should expect an increase of 5% to 6% in the cost of its MP3 players and iPods because attaining the exemption is so complicated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273946">The new 5% tax on iPods and MP3 players shows Conservative hypocrisy on tax hikes. Despite the photo op with the <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> at the end of 2010, there is a real iPod tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273947">The Conservatives have always tried to claim that they are the defenders of Canadian taxpayers. They have repeatedly run on platforms focused on tax cuts and promises not to raise taxes; they have broken their promises. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273948">New Democrats believe in doing politics differently. We believe politicians should be accountable for what they say and do. The Conservatives promised Canadians they would neither raise taxes nor create any new taxes. They have violated this pledge to Canadians. My hope is that all members of the House will consider the motion carefully and vote to condemn these harmful tax increases.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3273953">Mr. Speaker, in our judgment, it is not about the amount of taxes, it is about the amount of hypocrisy. The Conservatives have said repeatedly that they are the ones that taxpayers can trust to cut taxes, balance the books and not raise taxes. Those have been the promises. I am trying to demonstrate in the House the difference between the words of the government and the actions reflected in the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273954">A budget is the best expression of a government's priorities. Also, given the things that politicians say in advance of a budget, it gives us a very good barometer on the integrity of a government that promises not to do something and then turns around and demonstrably does the opposite.

              <ParaText id="3273965">Mr. Speaker, it grieves me deeply to be quoting the Fraser Institute on anything, but when it gets it right, it is important the truth be told. It has quoted the Canadian Consumer Tax Index. It has frequently done this. It is not novel for the Fraser Institute. It says there is such a thing in Canada as hidden taxes, and it clearly includes import duties and excise taxes on that list. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273966">That is what we are talking about: the hidden taxes facing Canadian consumers. The Conservatives say there is nothing about income tax, but Canadians know better. They know who pays and what the bottom line is. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3273968">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak to this very important issue, especially after the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="190572" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. He is relatively new to the House, but he gives a really good impression when he talks about financial matters, particularly regarding the Conservative government's hypocrisy when it comes to fiscal matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273969">That is why we are standing up here today and why we are having this opposition day. We want to talk about the Conservative government's hypocrisy when it comes to fiscal matters, particularly regarding its statements on finances, which do nothing to enhance its credibility—quite the contrary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273970">I am sure everyone remembers the now-famous phrase spoken by George Bush Sr. in the 1990s, just before he became the President of the United States. He had just won the Republican nomination and said the following simple phrase: “Read my lips: no new taxes.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273972">The Conservative government, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> had their own George Bush moment here in the House. At least they saved themselves the embarrassment of saying “read my lips”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273973">However, just this past February, at the Economic Club of Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said that there would be no new taxes in this budget. The day after the budget was presented, the <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> said that Canadians would not find any new taxes in it. We went over it very carefully, and there they are, clearly set out in annex 2 of budget 2013 tabled by the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273974">We clearly see an $8 billion increase in taxes over the next five years. We can debate the validity of some of these measures, but that is not what the Conservative government wants to do. It wants to deny the fact that it plans to increase taxes for Canadians to the tune of $8 billion over the next five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273975">There are so many tax hikes that I cannot address them all. However, I would like to mention four in particular. My colleague clearly described how approximately 72 countries will no longer benefit from the general preferential tariff, which applies to the customs tariffs paid by various countries. This measure applied to 72 countries, most of which are developing countries. Over 1,200 products from these 72 countries will no longer benefit from this tariff, which means that the government will be taking between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion more from the pockets of Canadian taxpayers over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273976">The Conservatives presented two arguments. First, they said that they are removing from the list countries that should no longer be there, such as China, South Korea and Taiwan—countries that have now reached a point where they are more developed. In such cases, the measure might be justified. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273977">However, the government is also removing from the list countries that it now considers to be fully developed, such as Kazakhstan, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Venezuela. The Conservative government is justifying the removal of these countries from the list by saying that they are now fully developed and that they no longer need the general preferential tariff. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273978">Yet, the general preferential tariff helps these developing countries, which need markets in order to export their products and further promote their economic growth. The only way the government can justify this measure is on the pretext that the GPT was a form of foreign aid for these countries. That is an interesting rationale. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273979">If Canada wants to develop these new markets, it must work with countries that have the means to purchase our goods. In order to do that, we have to help these countries to improve their economy, particularly through these tariffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273980">What is more, it is not just these countries that pay the price. Canadian consumers are also victims. I would like to talk about a few of the examples mentioned by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="190572" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. Take bicycles and tricycles. Right now, 50% of the bicycles sold in Canada come from these 72 countries. The government is proposing a 4.5% increase in taxes or duty on imports. This represents a tax hike of over $6 million, which will come from consumers' pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273981">Take baby strollers for example. Ninety percent of Canada's baby stroller market is supplied by these 72 countries. It will therefore be difficult for us to avoid these taxes on imports.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3273982">That is the equivalent of taking an extra $1 million or so out of consumers' pockets. Plastic school equipment fares no better in a market where 61% of it is imported. That tax hike equals $1.3 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273983">Ninety per cent of wigs typically used by cancer patients undergoing treatment are imported. The wigs never used to be subject to a tariff, but the proposed increase is equal to about 15.5% of their price. That will rob Canadians of $4.6 million. It does not end there, though. Prices of 1,200 products are going to increase significantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273984">Before I move on, I would like to mention, as my colleague did, the dedication of Mike Moffatt, who is an assistant professor and part of the Business, Economics and Public Policy group at the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273985">This budget contains more than just import taxes, however. It also contains tax hikes because it eliminates tax credits that are crucial to economic development. As I mentioned during debate on the budget, the Conservative government will gradually eliminate the tax credit for labour-sponsored venture capital corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273986">If the Conservative government claims that creating tax credits for sports, the arts and so on is a tax cut, then believe me, eliminating a tax credit is a tax hike for Canadians. This tax hike is worth $355 million over five years, and it will be particularly detrimental to economic development in Quebec, where approximately 90% of these tax credits were claimed. That is an extremely important point, because labour-sponsored funds have been a model in Quebec and an extremely useful tool for economic development. These funds were created in the 1980s, during a time of financial hardship, when venture capital did not really exist in Canada. That is when the Fonds de solidarité FTQ was created. In the past 30 years, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ has invested $10 billion in the Quebec economy. In recent years, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ has created or maintained 500,000 jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273987">This tax credit exists because it fulfills a specific need that other venture capital firms—specifically private-sector ones—do not, and because it makes it possible to invest in companies that are starting up or struggling. This explains why the return is lower with these funds, but that does not prevent small investors from contributing to the funds to save for retirement—since these are a type of RRSP—and also to help develop the local economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273988">In my region, the Lower St. Lawrence, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ assists 25 different businesses that have received absolutely nothing from private funds. On the one hand, the Conservatives are getting rid of this $355 million in tax credits, and on the other hand, they want to give another $400 million for private equity funds. This is absolutely ridiculous, and even Canada's Venture Capital and Private Equity Association, which represents private funds, is opposed to the elimination of the tax credit for labour-sponsored funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273989">The Conservatives have messed up, since this 15% tax credit is not going to the Fonds de solidarité or the CSN's Fondaction, as some may have believed. Small investors—the people who reinvest and who can benefit from this tax credit—are the ones who are being cheated here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273990">With this measure, the Conservatives will not only damage a tool that is essential to Quebec's economic development, but they will also discourage people from saving, which is extremely important, especially in Quebec. Of course, the other provinces are being encouraged to step up and create this type of fund. These funds invest in different businesses, and they also invest heavily in private venture capital firms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273991">I will talk about two other measures quickly, since my time is running out. First I want to talk about the $205 million tax increase over five years, because an additional credit for credit unions is being eliminated. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3273992">Once again, the government is going after credit unions with specific mandates to invest in small rural municipalities. It is making it hard for them to compete with the banks. This represents another tax hike for business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3273993">Second, we can debate the elimination of the tax credit for dividends that specifically affects SMEs and owners of SMEs that are not publicly owned or publicly traded. This represents a significant tax hike. We are talking about a tax grab of $2.34 billion over five—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274015">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to talk about the government's wonderful plan to make sure that we have tax fairness in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274016">When my colleague across the way from the NDP spoke just before me, he indicated that he did not want to answer the question about raising the GST. Here is why. The NDP has made up all this fearmongering dialogue about tax increases in budget 2013. There are no tax increases in budget 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274017">Let me explain for Canadians exactly what the NDP has done. The general preferential tariff, which is what today is all about, is about tax fairness. This foreign aid program was created in the 1970s to give special treatment to help companies in poor countries. That was the crux of what that general preferential tariff was intended to do. However, this program had not been reviewed or thoroughly looked at since the 1970s. That meant that companies in countries such as China and South Korea, whose economies are booming, were receiving privileged access to our market when competing against our Canadian companies, our Canadian businesses. That clearly needed to change, and that is exactly what we did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274018">Tax fairness is what this government is about. A high-tax agenda is what the NDP is all about. It wants to increase the GST. It wants a 45-day work year. It wants a $21 billion carbon tax. It wants to increase corporate taxes by about $34 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274019">Today we are going to address some of those very disturbing policies of the NDP. I am proud to stand here today against that high-tax agenda of the socialists, or are they now known as the social democrat members of the NDP? This weekend we saw a shocking display in Montreal at the NDP convention. The NDP, despite the fact that it debated countless far-left policy resolutions that would nationalize nearly every industry in Canada, raise taxes on every Canadian and rip up every trade deal Canada has ever signed, tried to hide the socialist roots it has entrenched in its party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274020">The NDP can play around with the words all it wants. It can paint its house with a brand new coat of paint, but it cannot hide the fact that it is big government. It believes in big government, and it believes in high-tax socialist policies. We know it. The NDP knows it, and Canadians know it. The NDP does not believe in capitalism.

The new tax-free savings account is improving incentives to save through a flexible, registered general-purpose account that allows Canadians to earn tax-free investment income. We have removed over $1 million low-income Canadians completely from the tax rolls, and we have reduced the overall tax burden to its lowest level in nearly 50 years.</ParaText>

We provided additional annual tax cuts to seniors and pensioners by increasing the age credit and the pension income credit amounts, raising the age limit for maturing savings in registered pension plans and registered retirement savings plans, and introducing pension income splitting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274036">We provided further support to students and their families by exempting scholarship income from taxation, introducing the textbook tax credit and making registered education savings plans more responsive to changing needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274037">We introduced the public transit tax credit to encourage public transit use. What is more, we have increased and enhanced benefits for Canadian families and individuals by introducing the universal child care benefit, introducing and enhancing the working income tax benefit and increasing the amount of income that families can earn in relation to the national child benefit supplement and the Canada child tax benefit. I could go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274038">Seniors and pensioners have benefited considerably from tax cuts. Our government's excellent record when it comes to tax relief means that they pay less tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274039">More specifically, since 2006, our Conservative government has increased the age tax credit for seniors by $2,000. We have doubled the maximum amount of eligible pension income that can be claimed under the pension income credit. It is now $2,000. We have introduced pension income splitting and increased the age limit for maturing pensions and registered retirement savings plans to 71 from 69 years of age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274040">Thanks to those measures, seniors and pensioners benefit from tax cuts worth about $2.7 billion every year. Since 2012, about 380,000 seniors no longer have to pay taxes. Once again, the NDP opposed all of these measures to cut taxes for seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274041">Our government has provided Canadians with nearly $160 billion in tax breaks overall. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274043">What exactly does that mean for Canadian families? Among other things, it means that they can keep more of their earnings to pay their bills, pay down their mortgage, save for their children's studies and save for their retirement. </ParaText>

Let us think about that for a moment. Canadian families can keep an extra $3,200 to put towards their personal priorities, but the NDP does not think that Canadians deserve to hold on to their earnings and benefit from these tax cuts. </ParaText>

As the quotes I just read demonstrate, the NDP members voted against and campaigned against our decision to cut the GST from 7% to 5%, a tax cut that is leaving $1,000 a year in the pockets of a typical Canadian family, and providing more than $12 billion in annual tax relief overall. What Canadians watching at home need to know is that the New Democrats have never admitted that cutting the GST actually left more money in the pockets of Canadians, a move that many economists have heralded for helping Canada's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274063">As Carl Sonnen of Infometrica previously noted, the two-point cut in the GST translated roughly into about 162,000 new jobs.

              <ParaText id="3274076">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your intervention. It was getting hard to hear myself over the noise in the Liberal corner over there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274077">As I was saying, I would like to challenge the NDP members here today, during this debate. I want them to state publicly and on the record the following. I want them to say that cutting the GST from 7% to 5% and leaving $1,000 a year in the pockets of a typical Canadian family was the right thing to do, or at least admit that it actually leaves money in Canadians' pockets, to let them decide how to use it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274078">Today's debate will run for about four hours and will include literally dozens of NDP speakers, and I only ask that one of the NDP speakers today, in front of all Canadians, make that simple statement. I ask if any NDP member will come clean with Canadians. Along with all Canadians from coast to coast to coast, I will be watching here today to see what the NDP will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274079">While I hope at least one NDP member will apologize for their misleading antics, pretending they did not say what they have said, I would bet the NDP members will not once admit that cutting the GST to leave more money in the pockets of Canadians was a positive move.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274080">Again, if the question is put to them, I hope the NDP members will not deflect, as the previous speaker from the NDP did. I hope they will answer the question sincerely and admit that they have stated some misleading things when they try to deny and say they have no intention of raising the GST. I think Canadians have heard their quotes here today. They need to admit to them or correct them or apologize for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274081"> Making sure that we have a low-tax agenda is something of which we are proud. We believe Canadians pay too much tax, and we continue to put forward budget after budget that does not impose new taxes on Canadians, and that includes budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274082"> Anything the NDP members are saying about the general preferential tariff today is false. It is created, just like their attempts to say that raising the GST by their party is false. They have admitted it. They need to start telling the honest to God truth about their plans.</ParaText>

That is the revenue that the government makes from tax measures. Among others, there is a dividend tax credit with an amount in parentheses of $2.3 billion over five years. There is also a measure that would scrap the labour-sponsored venture capital corporations tax credit, with an amount of $355 million in parentheses. Similarly, the general preferential tariff has an amount of $1.2 billion in parentheses.

In fact, Canadian families are benefiting from about $3,200 total every single year of tax income that used to be collected.

              <ParaText id="3274116">The general preferential tariffs is a regime that has not been looked at since the 1970s, and it was meant for poor countries where there are companies working so that we could help them. The budget will change that, so that booming economies like China, India, and Brazil are not benefiting from what was intended for poor countries. Essentially, individual Canadians and Canadian families, while we are working with the Retail Council of Canada, will see that consumers will benefit from lower costs of goods, thanks to measures that--</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274118">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to the opposition motion condemning certain tax increases in budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274119">I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274120">As many Canadians know, the Conservatives promised in the last election that if they were re-elected they would not raise taxes on Canadian consumers and families. They made that promise three times, in fact, in their platform. However, with budget 2013 the Conservatives have clearly broken that promise. They are raising taxes, which are tariffs but are actual taxes, on goods imported from other countries. These tariffs are a hidden tax on just about everything. It is really a hidden tax because Canadians do not see these taxes on receipts. For instance, the HST, GST, provincial sales tax, or consumption taxes are more transparent to Canadians. Instead, these import taxes are included in the sticker price, hidden from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274121"> Budget 2013 increases some tariffs while decreasing others, but the Conservatives' talking points only deal with the tariffs that are going down. The reality is that the budget reduces tariffs on 37 items while increasing tariffs on almost 1,300 products. Overall, it is clear that Canadian consumers will be worse off. Another thing to consider is that when tariffs go up and retailers increase the sticker prices, Canadians have to pay more. However, when tariffs go down, the full savings are not always passed on to the consumer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274122">Mike Moffatt is a business professor at Western University and has been doing a tremendous job on educating Canadians on these tax increases in the most recent federal budget. He has done this in spite of contradictory information from the Conservative government. Professor Moffatt has written that “Canadian consumers will be feeling a major hit to their pocketbooks” as a result of these tax increases. He stated that “the tariff changes make it more expensive to raise a child” in Canada. He pointed out that Conservative tax increases will make it more expensive to buy baby carriages, school supplies, children's bicycles, tricycles, and wagons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274123">He also said that “Canadian consumers will be paying tens of millions more to furnish their homes” because the Conservatives are raising taxes on everything from coffee and tea makers to rugs with synthetic fibres, paint brushes, rollers, plastic tableware, and household goods. He estimates that higher tariffs on imported wigs will cost Canadians an additional $4.6 million per year, which is shameful when we think that a lot of the people requiring wigs are cancer patients. Therefore, the Conservatives are actually taxing people at the most vulnerable times in their lives. Conservatives are increasing taxes on hospital parking, which will, of course, make it more expensive for Canadians to get treatment or to visit sick loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274124">In terms of Canadian retailers, these higher taxes do not just hurt consumers and Canadian middle-class families. They hurt Canadian retailers. The increase to import taxes in budget 2013 will widen the price gap between Canada and the U.S. For example, certain shoes will go from being duty free to having an extra tax of 18%. When the Canadian price is increased by 18% while the U.S. price stays the same, it is going to encourage more cross-border shopping and will particularly hurt retailers in border communities. This is on top of the Conservative move last year to increase the amount that Canadians can bring back from the U.S. duty free, a move that also encourages more Canadians to do more shopping in the U.S. and, as such, hurts retailers in Canadian border communities in particular. Cross-border shopping hurts Canadian retailers, specifically small businesses that are operating on very small margins. It hurts Canadians who depend on the retail sector for their jobs and it is not clear why the Conservatives would want to put these jobs at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274125">There is another perhaps unintended consequence of these tax increases on imports. Caught in budget 2013 changes are employers and employees in least-developed countries, as well as the Canadian businesses that have been working with them as part of their supply chain. Under the current rules, manufacturers in least-developed countries can use some inputs from GPT countries and still qualify for lower tariffs. For example, shoemakers in Bangladesh or Cambodia could use fabrics from China and still meet the rules of origin for least-developed countries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274126">However, by removing China from the GPT list without making consequential changes to the rules for the least-developed countries, that shoemaker in Bangladesh or Cambodia will no longer qualify for duty-free treatment. Instead, his shoes will face an import tax of 18%, which will go directly to the Conservative government. It is worse for the Canadian consumer and it is worse for impoverished labourers in the developing world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274127">It is not just these taxes and these tariffs that the Conservatives are increasing in the budget. Despite their promise not to raise taxes, they have raised EI premiums three times since the last election. EI premiums are a payroll tax that every worker and employer must pay. Conservatives have been known to call it a job-killing payroll tax. The current <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said in the past, “For many businesses, an increase in payroll taxes would make it harder to sustain existing jobs.” The <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> went further. He said, “That is what Canadians do not want, a job-killing payroll tax increase…Those of us on this side of the House will not buy into that socialist scheme to raise taxes.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274128">I am a little surprised that the foreign minister is now, based on his own words, adopting a socialist scheme. In fact, the Conservatives have raised payroll taxes three times. Just when the New Democrats have moved beyond socialism, the Conservatives seem to have embraced it, based on their own words. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274129">Raising EI premiums is another Conservative broken promise. The Conservatives raised the EI tax rate in budget 2011, they did it in budget 2012, and they have done it in budget 2013. In fact, the Conservatives have raised the EI tax rate by 8.7% since the last election. For average workers, that is almost $150 more per year taken off their paycheques. It is $150 less for them to use to pay the bills or to put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274130">The tax increases in budget 2013 will make life tougher for middle-class Canadian families at a very tough time. Canadian households have watched their incomes flatline over the last several years, while the cost of living is going up. At the same time, household debt has skyrocketed, as families take out second mortgages or turn to credit cards to try to make ends meet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274131">Canadian families now owe a record $1.67 for every dollar of annual income. They are barely making ends meet today, with record low interest rates, and they are petrified as to what will happen in the future as rates will inevitably rise. They are worried about the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s recent demand that banks increase their mortgage prices, as though the last few years have not been hard enough for middle-class families. The minister asked Manulife to increase its mortgage rate from 2.89% to 3.09% and asked for other banks to follow suit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274132">What does that mean for a Canadian family with a $400,000 mortgage? It means an additional $12,000 out of their pockets over the next five years. That is an extra $12,000 that a Canadian family will not have to put toward their children's education or for their retirement. They will not have that money to help pay basic expenses or to make ends meet. It is also an extra $12,000 in bank profits, simply because the finance minister decided to meddle in mortgage prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274133">In terms of other broken promises, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he would “preserve the old age security, the guaranteed income supplement, and the Canada pension plan, and all projected future increases to these programs”. We all know that in budget 2012, the Conservatives broke that promise. Instead of preserving old age security and the guaranteed income supplement, they cut it by raising the age of eligibility from 65 to 67, hurting the most vulnerable seniors. We know that 40% of seniors receiving OAS make less than $20,000 per year and that 53% make less than $25,000 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274134">It is clear that Conservative broken promises will make it harder for Canadian middle-class families to make ends meet. We know that these latest tax hikes in budget 2013 on imported goods are going to disproportionately affect young families by making it more expensive for them to buy shoes and bicycles for their children. The hikes will also make it more expensive to buy basic furnishings for their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274135">This comes at a time when middle-class Canadian families are struggling. It is a time when young Canadians are struggling to find work. Education costs, student debt, and the lack of opportunities are creating a situation where almost 30% of young Canadians between the ages of 25 and 29 are living back at home. There is a lot of hardship out there and this is no time for the Conservatives to be raising taxes on middle-class families, on young families that are struggling today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274139">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member because he is absolutely right. It is about choices. In fact, hosting the G8 and the G20 actually cost Canadian taxpayers and Canadian families over $1.2 billion.

It is effectively tax dollars that hard-working Canadian middle-class families are sending to Ottawa and are expecting us to manage it well.

That comes at a real cost to Canadian families that are struggling to make ends meet. </ParaText>

They should think as well of the attack on seasonal industries and seasonal workers by the increasing taxation through EI premiums on both employers and employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274152"> My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> in summary basically has said that the budget increases tariffs on a host of consumer goods, imposes the GST on pay parking at hospitals and colleges, increases taxes on small credit unions and continues employment insurance tax increases on Canadian workers and employers. It is not going the right way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274153">The issue of the removal of the preferential tariffs is a decision the government has made in the same manner it has made most of its decisions, in secret in a sneaky kind of way. The announcement contained in the budget of March 21, 2013, on pages 134 and 135 relating to the general preferential tariff, is worth noting. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, in a statement on December 21, 2012, indicated the department was accepting submissions in the consultation period concerning the issue of preferential tariffs between December 21, 2012 and February 13, 2013. The budget was presented on March 21. Who was consulted in that period? Again, Canadians have no way of knowing, no matter how one slices it, how this decision will cost them in consumer goods. How was that decision made?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274154">Beyond the secrecy and the sneaky way of increasing taxes, let us look at the wider issue, and that is the Conservative government's record on international trade generally. Taxes and trade are part of the government's agenda. There are some key facts that we should consider. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274155">According to Statistics Canada, our country continues to be marred by a continual merchandise trade deficit. In the most recent Statistics Canada publication on merchandise trade, which was tabled on April 5 of this year, Canada's merchandise trade deficit increased for the first two months of 2013. What is most disturbing is that our exports are 5.1% lower than in 2008, the year the global economic crisis began. This means that in spite of the rhetoric of the government, 39 of the last 51 months have seen the country marred by a trade deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274156">Prior to the Conservative government assuming office, Canada had been experiencing trade surpluses since the 1970s. According to the World Bank, since 2009 Canada had been running an ever-increasing current account trade deficit. The facts reveal that Canada, when compared to 17 of the other strongest economies, has consistently been at the bottom of the list in terms of trade performance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274157">A recent report from the CIBC has found that the hyper-trade negotiating agenda of the Conservative government has failed to live up to expectations. The report found that Canada remained dependent on our United States trading partner and that in spite of the Conservative government turning away from the United States toward other markets, the result was that non-U.S. trade had actually declined on a year-over-year basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274158">In the past five years all of the growth in terms of exports to developing countries has been with China. The past decade has seen our exports stall while our imports have increased by 45%, which translates into what the CIBC describes as a lost decade for exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274159">The government claims that it brings in trade. Some would ask why I would talk about trade when we are talking about tariffs. Tariffs and trade go together. The government claimed that 2013 would be the year of trade. However, when it comes to trade, there has been an absolute failure on the part of the government. There has also been an utter failure on the part of the government when it comes to how tariffs and taxes affect middle-class and low-income Canadians, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170626" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> has outlined so well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274160">Just to sum up on trade, I want to quote from a business press article published in 2009 entitled “Trade deficit Canada's first since 1976”, which states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274174">Mr. Speaker, the truth is that if our government were raising taxes, the Liberals would be supporting it. Our government has lowered taxes for Canadians in every way in which the Government of Canada collects taxes. In fact, a family of four today has $3,200 more in its pocket than it did when our government first came into office. If the hon. member really believes in putting more money in families' pockets, he must really hate himself for not having supported those tax cuts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274176">With regard to government ads, he said that the government is wasting money on government ads. We are spending less money on government ads than the Liberals did when they were in government. If he is against government ads, he must really hate himself for his track record. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274177">He talked about the importance of deficits. The truth is that our government has cut the deficit in half. As a matter of fact, when we did our stimulus spending, the Liberals opposite all voted in favour of that spending and said that we should be spending more. If he is against deficit spending, boy he really must hate himself for voting for our economic action plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274178">With regard to trade, Canada is at the table of the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We are negotiating the Canada-Europe trade agreement.

Ever since, we have seen deficits from that government.</ParaText>

Canada is playing second fiddle to the United States and Europe in negotiations. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274191">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, in his budget speech just this year, said, “We will not raise taxes”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274192">It is profound hypocrisy to then, in this budget, forget this promise and raise taxes for Canadians that will mean nearly $8 billion out of their pockets. The Conservatives are raising taxes on over 1,200 types of goods that will hit Canadians right in the pocketbook, things Canadians have to pay for every day—basic goods and services—whether it is school products for kids, household utensils or bicycles. Even iPods are not exempt. The list of taxes is quite significant. Over 80% of consumer goods will be affected. They include baby carriages, school supplies, as I said, shoes, clothes, and many other consumer products in a time of a still very fragile economic situation. The economy is still in a fragile state, and to have this kind of tax on everything is very difficult for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274193">I want to emphasize the iPod tax, which is, of course, buried among the taxes listed in budget 2013. It is a new 5% tax on MP3 players and iPods that are coming into Canada. To emphasize the hypocrisy of this tax, I want to cite the <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages</Affiliation>, who, in December 2010, said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274195">However, that is exactly what the government has introduced. This is going to be hitting more than 80% of Canadian products, things such as safety deposit boxes and insurance programs and even more substantial programs, such as labour-sponsored venture capital corporations, which are investment bodies that create jobs and help build communities across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274196">I have spoken to chambers of commerce and investors who are very concerned that the government has simply misunderstood what these venture capital corporations are about. It saw the word “labour” and thought maybe it would just be attacking unions by raising taxes on these labour-sponsored funds rather than attacking communities and jobs and upsetting business and the investment community.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274197">The government has also raised taxes on credit unions. We believe that competition is a healthy thing, including in the financial sector; credit unions provide healthy competition for the major banks in this country, but instead the government has opted for a cash grab that is going to impact the operation of credit unions across this country. Again, I do not know whether this is just an exercise in hypocrisy or whether they really do not like credit unions, because the impact of this tax on credit unions is going to be significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274198">In sum, Conservatives are increasing the costs on average Canadians, but let us look at the record of the government when it comes to profitable companies and when it comes to the wealthy in this country. We have seen the current government, like the Liberal government before it, cutting tens of billions of dollars in taxes on profitable corporations. At the same time, it has turned a blind eye to tax havens and money going offshore that could be contributing to the public coffers. Maybe it would mean Canadians would not have to be taxed on iPods, bicycles and kids' shoes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274199">Fully one-quarter of all Canadian foreign direct investments has gone into tax havens. In 2011 alone, Canadians invested, so to speak, $53.3 billion in Barbados and $25.8 billion in the Cayman Islands. Is this money that should be here in Canada, being taxed and contributing the public good in this country? Would that not be a fair way to treat Canadian tax dollars? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274200">At a time when nearly 1.4 million Canadians are unemployed and when in March alone Canadians lost 54,000 full-time jobs, we have seen a record increase in temporary foreign workers. They have tripled in number. Companies are allowed to pay them 15% less than Canadian workers, so we are seeing the suppression of Canadian wages and the undermining of jobs and taxes here in Canada at the same time as the dinging of average consumers in the pocketbook, which will affect every Canadian family across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274201">It is the height of hypocrisy. It is a betrayal of the needs of Canadians during this fragile economic period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274202">We believe that fair is fair. We should all be contributing fairly to the good of this country to make sure that our social programs and services run in a manner that Canadians want to see and contribute to the public good right across this country.</ParaText>

It gave an advantage to countries like China and South Korea, which had privileged access to Canada in terms of competing with Canadian businesses. It seems a bit like crocodile tears when the opposition members say we do not provide the necessary support to Canadian businesses while on the other hand they are against the changes we are proposing, which will actually make it much more fair in terms of competing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274216">I am well aware that some, if not most, Conservative government members like living in the past. However, at some point, they need to get with the times and adopt measures that are relevant to Canada's current conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274217">I certainly agree with some government members who claim that the general preferential tariff or GPT regime needed to be modernized. Unfortunately, these changes are too late for some countries. In fact, one could easily say that the changes are 20 years too late for some of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274218">What is more, the government is applying the new regime to a wide range of countries, some of which still need the GPT. This is a really unfortunate aspect of the budget and is symptomatic of the government's complete unwillingness to consider any insight that could help it to implement measures that would assist Canadian families and companies. Perhaps the government is naive or just ignorant in its very narrow perspective, its blindness as to what is going on with the economy. We will continue to work, to keep an eye on the issue and to demonstrate the government's ignorance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274219">When I say that this measure is 20 years too late, I am thinking about certain specific countries and the overall erosion of Canada's industrial sector. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were very quickly lost under this Conservative government.</ParaText>

This measure will only exacerbate the problem. Indeed, especially considering the product categories that will be affected, the proposed regime can even be compared to a flat tax that will hit the middle class and our small and medium-sized businesses most of all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274221">I say this because, as the member for Beauport—Limoilou, I know very well which sectors and segments of the population will be directly affected and hit hard by this in their daily lives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274225">Clearly, everyone agrees that the various sectors of our economy are operating under conditions that are forcing them to adapt. Certain changes have taken place that have forced some companies to shut down, while still others have had to cut back their operations. However, the reprehensible abandonment of many industry sectors in the face of justifiable and inevitable globalization—for which the government should have positioned itself so as to be able to adapt—is almost criminal. This has driven many people in a number of our large communities into an abyss that they just cannot get out of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274226">I do not know who, on the government side, could answer the legitimate questions that young families in Limoilou, people in their 20s and 30s, are asking. These families have chosen to live downtown, near their workplace, and they have chosen to stand up for a good quality of life. However, they are going to have to deal with tariff hikes, which are a type of forced tax that the government is applying improperly. We should not be surprised by what this government is doing. This is exactly the type of unilateral measure that the Conservatives implement, just like those they imposed on the provinces with regard to health transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274227">The government does not consult Canadians and does not even examine the issues. The measures that it implements seem to be the result of the sort of misguided inspiration that comes from too little sleep. It is really shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274228">As I had the opportunity to mention today, I have the great privilege of being a member of the Standing Committee on Finance, and I have also had the opportunity to serve on the Standing Committee on International Trade. On many occasions, I took the time to speak out against the government's shameful naivety when it comes to international trade. Our country is suffering a great deal as a result of this government's extremely simplistic views and policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274229">Take China, for example. It is one of the countries that is being targeted by the changes to the tariff regime. A country's place in the economy deserves to be debated in order to determine the role it must play. However, when the government lets things go, does not react and does not take into account the conditions that exist in other countries of the world, it should not be surprised when it gets results as poor as those we are currently getting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274230">I would like to talk about China since this country's success is in large part due to the fact that it is an extremely interventionist country. It is therefore rather ironic that the government is trying to teach everyone a lesson without even taking into account the objective conditions of the world economic order. I am not necessarily asking the government to be protectionist, but it must be aware that it has to do something when other countries fail to engage in fair play. This is the kind of thing that the NDP will not just put up with. On the contrary, when countries seek to attack Canada, the NDP will react and respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274231">In conclusion, I would like to say that China has taken a very interventionist approach when it comes to currency. It has kept the value of its currency very low. It has taken a very interventionist approach to job and business creation and has paid out massive subsidies in the guise of loans to companies by Chinese banks that did not even require repayment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274232">Now our core industry has been ravaged. This measure comes too late, is completely useless and places an unnecessary burden on our small and medium-sized businesses as well as our families.</ParaText>

In the most recent budget, the Conservatives would take the liberty of decreasing 37 different tariffs. Canadians were told in many forums that the Government of Canada took great pride in the fact that it would reduce tariffs. What the Conservatives did not say at the time is that they would actually increase more than 1,300 tariffs at the same time within the same budget. That increase in tariffs would generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually in different forms of revenue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274235">Might the member provide some comment on why the Conservatives might have been a little selective in terms of exactly what message they were trying to send Canadians on the whole issue of tariffs, when in fact quite the opposite might be the case, where the Conservatives would increase so many, compared to decreasing?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274239">The government seems to be focusing on one thing in particular, and that is the fact that 72 countries will no longer be covered by the general preferential tariff, which is an import tax that is lower for certain countries.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3274247">Mr. Speaker, as <Affiliation DbId="170862" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, I am pleased to stand today against the NDP's opposition day motion. It is another opportunity to remind Canadians of the NDP's record on taxes. That record speaks for itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274248">Time and time again, NDP members stand in this place and vote no against our Conservative government's actions to lower the tax burden, protesting efforts to leave Canadian families and businesses with more money to help them grow our economy. Even worse, the NDP continues to call for billions in new taxes on Canadians; that is, from a carbon tax that would raise the price of everything, to a $10-billion-a-year tax hike on businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274249">Unlike the NDP, our Conservative government believes that leaving more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadians is the right thing to do, and we have the record to prove it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274250">Since coming to office in 2006, we have cut taxes more than 150 times, reducing taxes in every way that government collects them. Actually, I just noted that, in one of the NDP mail-outs to its constituents, the whip encourages Canadians to ensure that they take advantage of these tax reduction opportunities. Even in its mail-outs to its constituents, the NDP is acknowledging the very important measures we have provided. It was quite gratifying to see the NDP actually sending out that mail-out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274251">We have cut taxes more than 150 times, and we have reduced them in every way that government collects them. We have removed more than one million Canadians from the tax rolls altogether, and the overall tax burden on Canadians is now at the lowest point in more than five decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274252">Today, I would like to highlight some of these important measures that our government has done to support job-creating businesses across Canada—tax relief that the NDP consistently opposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274253">Our approach to business taxation follows simple logic. Lower taxes make Canada's economy stronger and create stable, long-term jobs. Today, Canada has the best record of jobs and growth and recovery among the G7 nations. We can see how that plan is meshing and is working. In fact, a recent study by KPMG concluded that Canada's total business tax costs—business income taxes, capital taxes, sales taxes, property taxes and wage-based taxes—are more than 40% lower than those in the United States. Again, I just think we need to compare how Canada is doing against the United States fiscally and in terms of our net GDP-to-debt ratio in order to know our plan is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274254">In short, our government has created an environment that encourages new investments, growth and job creation, one that ensures Canada has the strongest fiscal position and the lowest business tax costs in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274255">When we consider our Conservative government's unparalleled commitment to lowering taxes, especially for job-creating small businesses, the NDP motion is a scary prospect for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274256">The NDP position is very well known. The<Affiliation DbId="182412" Type="7">opposition House leader </Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>, in British Columbia, summed it up best when he said, “...tax cutting is seen to be a failed strategy...”. That is absolutely wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274257">Let me now highlight some of our government's key initiatives that demonstrate our continuing leadership in lowering taxes for businesses, all of which, again I have to point out, the NDP voted against.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274258">Canadians understand that a competitive business tax plays a key role in supporting businesses in all sectors of the economy to invest, grow and thrive. Our government has implemented broad-based tax reductions that support investment and growth. These cuts are delivering more than $60 billion of tax relief to job-creating businesses over a six-year period, ending in 2013-14.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274259">For example, to spur investment and productivity, we have reduced the federal business tax rate to 15% in 2012 from 21% in 2007, which is amazing support for our corporations. The small business tax rate was reduced to 11%, and the amount of income eligible for this lower rate was increased to $500,000 in 2009.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274260">Canada's system of international taxation was improved to better support cross-border trade and investments. These actions are part of a policy framework that increases the productive capacity of the Canadian economy as well as Canadian living standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274261">Lower business tax rates and other tax changes have increased investment in Canada and reduced the costs of expanding, giving businesses strong incentives to invest and hire in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274262">Our government's low-tax plan is helping to guide the Canadian economy along the path of sustainable economic growth. Real business investment in Canada is now 8.1% higher than its pre-recession peak, while no other G7 country has even returned to its pre-recession levels. Again, having a positive business environment encourages people to come and invest. It encourages the job creators in the country that produce the wealth for those important social services program and the things we value. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274263">More examples include tax relief for new manufacturing machinery and equipment that will help businesses invest for the future. The accelerated capital cost allowance for machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing and processing sector was first introduced in budget 2007 and extended in budget 2008, budget 2009 and budget 2011 in response to the ongoing global economic challenges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274264">The ACCA allows businesses to write off eligible investments faster, providing them with the support they need to retool and remain competitive. Canadian businesses from across the country have applauded this measure, which is very important in helping them to expand. Indeed, as the finance committee heard from witnesses from across the country, this was a consistent message in terms of ways that we could support the business communities. In total, more than 25,000 businesses in the manufacturing and processing sectors, employing Canadians in all regions of the country, have taken advantage of the accelerated capital cost allowance since it was first introduced in 2007. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274265">On the advice of the Canadian Manufacturing Coalition and others, we will provide $1.4 billion of tax relief over four years to the manufacturing and processing sectors through a two-year extension of a temporary accelerated capital cost allowance for new investment in machinery and equipment. This tax relief will encourage manufacturers and processors to accelerate and undertake additional investment in machinery and equipment, making their operations more productive and globally competitive. It will enable manufacturing and processing companies to plan and invest over the coming years and help create jobs in a sector that has been particularly hard hit by the global recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274266">Key measures introduced by our government are already delivering substantial tax relief to small businesses and small business owners. Reductions in the small business tax rate to 11% and increases in the small business income limit to $500,000 are estimated to provide small businesses more than $2 billion in tax relief in 2013 and more than $10.4 billion over the 2008-09 to 2013-14 period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274267">I would like to give an example. A small Canadian controlled private corporation, with $500,000 in taxable income, has seen its federal corporate tax bill decline by more than one-third, from $83,600 in 2006 to $55,000 in 2013. That is a tax saving of over 30%, or $28,600, that can be reinvested in the business to fuel the growth and expansion that creates new jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274268">Again, I have to point out that the NDP shamefully voted against all those tax reductions for small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274269">However, we are doing even more than this. The lifetime capital gains exemption on qualified small business shares was increased to $750,000. It was at $500,000 in budget 2007. We are looking at the first increase in an exemption since 1988. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274270">This LCGE, as it is known in short form, is estimated to be delivering almost $1 billion of federal tax relief annually to small business owners, farmers and fishermen, and certainly every one of us in our ridings see the challenges small business owners face and the very important role they play in our communities. They are the first people supporting jobs, training for young people and communities and the many endeavours undertaken. It is a giant first step in 2013 and will go up to $800,000 in 2014. In addition, to ensure that the value does not erode over time, we will index a new $800,000 LCGE limit to inflation, which is for the first time ever, something members of the finance committee heard people across Canada ask for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274271">Representatives of job-creating businesses, large and small, have told us time and time again that this tax relief is crucial in helping them expand their operations and hire more Canadians, but again opposition members are just not listening.

In recognition of the critical role that small businesses play as job creators in the Canadian economy, the economic action plan proposes to extend for one year the temporary hiring credit for small businesses. This temporary credit will be available to an estimated 560,000 employers, allowing small businesses to reinvest approximately $225 million in job creation in 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274281">Certainly, in my role as parliamentary secretary, I am especially pleased that economic action plan 2013 has announced that CRA will take even more action to reduce red tape and improve services for small businesses. For example, CRA has created a dedicated team that is responsible for coordinating and addressing small business issues. The CRA has mandated the team to ensure that the agency takes a small business lens approach to service improvements, with a renewed and enhanced focus on cutting red tape. This focus on engagement with small business stakeholders will ensure that the perspectives of the small business community are continuously taken into account in every aspect of the work that CRA does. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274324">I want to begin by thanking my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="190572" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, for moving this motion. He is giving us an opportunity to elaborate on certain aspects of the budget brought down by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274325">During the election campaign, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> publicly and formally promised Canadians there would be no new taxes. Not even six months ago, his <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> reiterated that promise in anticipation of budget 2013-14. Meanwhile, they accuse their adversaries of wanting to increase the tax burden and they claim to be standing up for the taxpayer. We now know that was just malarkey. In reality, the Conservatives were secretly preparing massive tax hikes that affect all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274326">With support from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> went against every one of this government's public positions and basically increased Canadians' tax burden. The <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> challenged us to find tax increases in the budget. We found them handily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274327">No less than 1,290 types of products will be subject to higher tariffs. These new tariffs on a wide range of sectors in more than 70 countries are significant: 5% more for bicycles, 11% for scissors, 3% for strollers, 6% for table fans, 10% for vinegar and so forth. There is even a new 5% tax on iPods even though the Conservatives falsely accused the official opposition of promoting such a measure. This is another example of the government's hypocrisy when it comes to economics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274328">Generally speaking, we are not talking about luxury items here. We are talking about standard consumer products that are used by the majority of Canadian households. It is not the importers of these products who are going to absorb the bulk of these new tariffs. It is the consumer who is going to be stuck with the bill. It is not just consumers who are going to feel the impact of this unjustified measure. Retailers located close to the Canada-U.S. border are going to see their sales decline again because of this new price gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274329">This is an ironic choice by a government that falsely claims to defend taxpayers and help the economy. Unfortunately for Canadians, the Conservatives did not stop there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274330">In addition to these tariff increases, the government is eliminating the 15% tax credit for money invested in labour-sponsored venture capital corporations. The government got this money back over a three-year period because businesses grew and formerly unemployed workers paid more taxes. Instead of addressing the fact that Canada is behind when it comes to venture capital, the Conservatives decided to go after Canadian taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274331">I want to point out that the government is eliminating the preferential tax rates for co-operatives. This means that co-operatives such as Mouvement Desjardins will support fewer small and medium-sized businesses and fewer projects. This also means less money in the pockets of depositors, who are once again being affected by the Conservatives' policies. Add to that the end of the tax exemption for things such as parking and safety deposit box rentals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274332">As a result of these measures, taxpayers will have less wiggle room and will have to either spend less or go more into debt, which is never good news for the economy. Over a period of just five years, the 2013-14 budget is increasing the tax burden by $7.8 billion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274333">This burden will go from $500 million this year to $2.3 billion before the end of the decade. Between 2010 and 2018, the Conservatives will have increased the tax burden by nearly $20 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274334">The public is the government's first victim. After cutting all federal government services to the public in their 2012-13 budget, the Conservatives are now dipping into taxpayers' pockets. Now, Canadians will be paying more for fewer services. The Conservatives will have to take responsibility for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274335">This government made a choice. True to form, it decided to spare major corporations and the wealthy and force the general public to suffer the consequences. The main impact of the $12 billion in tax cuts for the private sector was to increase the financial reserves of Canadian businesses from $185 billion to $575 billion over a period of 10 years. While major corporations will benefit from the Conservatives' handouts, Canadians will be paying more to live their lives. This is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274336">Why make Canadian taxpayers suffer because of the government's budget cuts? Why cut the number of employees at the Canada Revenue Agency by 6% when the government is losing tens of billions of dollars to tax evasion? Why eliminate tax cuts that stimulate the Canadian economy when the economic outlook is still uncertain?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274337">The current motion condemns this situation. We want to speak out against this government's poor choices. The latest budget cuts will affect people's day-to-day lives. This wide range of new taxes will undoubtedly impact consumer confidence and debt levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274338">The Conservatives refuse to admit that tax cuts for big business severely limited the government's room to manoeuvre but did not have much of an impact on economic growth. They refuse to admit that their decisions are catching up with them and that Canadians are the ones now paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274339">With that in mind, I ask the members here to support the motion moved by the member for <Affiliation DbId="190572" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, thus sending a clear message to the government: the significant tax hikes set out in the latest budget are unacceptable, inappropriate and unjustified.</ParaText>

As businesses struggle with the new tariffs that are imposed on them, the burden of these taxes will be passed directly to the already cash-strapped end consumers, who will do more and more of their shopping across the border in the United States. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3274357">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and speak to our opposition day motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274358"> First, the Canadian public is getting all too used to not taking what the Conservative government says to them at face value. In 2008, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claimed that “As long as I will be Prime Minister...there will be no new taxes”. In the budget speech, the finance minister claimed that his budget would not raise taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274359">Yet, all too predictably, the budget that was presented to Parliament last month shows that the Conservatives are not living up to their promises. In fact, the budget detailed three separate types of tax increases: first, through changes to the general preferential tariff regime; second, by changing current tax rules relating to credit unions, safety deposit boxes and workers' funds; and finally, by adding the GST and HST to previously exempted types of parking, including at schools, at municipal parking lots and, most shockingly, at hospitals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274360">The tax hikes detailed in budget 2013 would cost Canadians $8 billion over the next five years. The Conservative MPs will no doubt say it is not a tariff and is not a tax, but this simply is not true. Let us stamp out that argument from the outset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274361">Even the <I>Encyclopedia Britannica</I> defines a tariff as “a tax levied upon goods as they cross national boundaries, usually by the government of the importing country”. The government can call these tariff changes whatever it wants, but that does not change what they are: a tax increase, and one that will hit the poorest Canadians the hardest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274362">Mike Moffat, an assistant professor at the University of Western Ontario, summarized the entirety of these tariff changes most succinctly when he said, “These tax increases are also likely to be regressive in nature”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274363">What products will be hit by these tax changes? It is a pretty long list, including bicycles, baby carriages, coffee makers, scissors, rubber sandals, vinegar, umbrellas, paint brushes and perfume, just to name a few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274364">Let us look at some of these in a little more detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274365">Canada imports bicycles worth $125 million from countries covered by the general preferential tariff regime. The changes in the budget will see the tariff on imported bicycles increase from 8.5% to 13%, which will cost Canadians between $5 million and $6 million a year. Ironically, the government was all too happy to shout from the rafters about its cut in tariffs on sporting equipment, but while it gives with one hand, it takes away with the other. If the government is aiming to make it cheaper for Canadians to get active, why is it increasing the cost of bicycles, which not only help Canadians stay healthy but also offer an environmentally friendly method of transportation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274366">The increased tax on baby carriages is equally perplexing. Again, the government was happy to sell the reduction on tariffs on baby clothes, but I do not remember any Conservative MPs or government spokespeople talking about the $1 million annual tax increase on baby carriers. Roughly 90% of all baby carriages imported into Canada come from countries covered by the general preferential tariff regime. This means that a huge majority of baby carriages will see a 3% tariff rise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274367">However, probably the most surprising of these tax increases is the government's iPod tax. The hypocrisy of the Conservatives on this is shocking. Not only did they promise no new taxes, but they have specifically promised no tax on iPods. A joint statement issued by the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> and the then Minister of Industry in December 2010 stated, “During this fragile economic recovery, the last thing Canadian families and consumers need is a massive new tax on iPods”. Given this statement, why is the government now implementing a tariff increase on MP3 players that equates to a 5% iPod tax?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274368">The Conservatives would have us believe that this tariff will not be applied to iPods due to a special exemption dated back to 1987 on devices that are plugged into a computer. The problem with this argument is that it has already been refuted by a government department.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274369">An internal memo from March 2012 by the Canada Border Services Agency states that it is cracking down on this exemption as the application process, which has not been fulfilled on most MP3 players, requires a certificate for each product to be signed by the consumer. CBSA, explaining its crackdown, said: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274370">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As the vast majority of end-users of these products are consumers, it is expected that the required certification will not be available as the onus is on the importer to have the required certificate completed by the consumer, typically at the time of sale.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274371">Further, the crackdown “will likely result in a significant amount of customs duty being reassessed, and will not be well-received by the importing community.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274372">In fact, the final nail in the coffin of the Conservatives' argument is that CBSA has already written to one importer of the iPod touch 8GB to tell it that the product is subject to end-user verification for each and every product sold in order to get the tariff exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274373">It makes no sense for the Conservatives to increase the taxes on all these consumer goods, especially when the government's other austerity measures, as pointed out by <I>The Economist</I>, mean that the Conservatives are essentially relying on consumer spending to get the Canadian economy into gear. In fact, both BMO chief economist Doug Porter and Martin Schwartz, CEO of the bike manufacturer, Dorel Industries, have pointed out that the most likely consumer response to these tariff changes would be an increase in cross-border shopping, therefore hurting Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274374">I will also talk briefly about some of the other tax increases in this budget. The elimination of both the tax credit for labour-sponsored venture capital corporations or workers' funds and the preferential tax rate for credit unions smack of ideological attacks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274375">The elimination of the workers' funds tax credit would particularly hurt middle-class Canadians who were eligible for a tax credit of 15% on investments of up to $5,000. This tax increase would seem to be a direct attack on the labour movement, which would hurt the venture capital sector in Canada more generally. Just last year, the Conservatives announced their desire to help Canada's venture capital industry which lags behind its U.S. counterpart. Then, they turn around and kick one of the legs away from under it. It is no surprise that Canada's Venture Capital and Private Equity Association has expressed its disappointment with this tax increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274376">Similarly, the elimination of the preferential tax rate for credit unions would seem like nothing more than a cash grab on an industry which offers ethical and lower-risk financial services to Canadians. The elimination of the preferential rate would add $10 million to $75 million in tax costs to credit unions, costs which unfortunately would have to be passed on to the credit unions' customers or would lead to cuts in the great community work that credit unions do from coast to coast to coast. In fact, the only people who are happy with this proposed decision are the bankers, who would see their competition weakened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274377">It is quite clear that the tax increases announced in this budget would do nothing to help consumers, would hurt Canadian businesses, as more people look to shop in the U.S., and would weaken competition in the financial sector. However, they also would prove that Canadians cannot trust the promises made by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274378">It is time that the public can trust that the government will do what it says. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274379">Mr. Speaker, I listened very intently to this member's speech. I wonder if the New Democrats' idea of helping our manufacturers is to give our competitors an advantage that our own Canadian manufacturers do not have. We know that the New Democrats spent the entire weekend trying to convince Canadians they are what they are not. That is free traders, people who understand how the economy works; people who understand that reducing taxes for families, businesses, and individuals helps spur economic growth, the type of growth that we have seen here, with over 900,000 jobs created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274380">Does this now mean that the New Democrats are in favour of free trade? Do they actually now agree that free trade helps create business and boost the economy? Are they supportive of free trade with the United States? Are they supportive of North American free trade? Are they supportive of our efforts on free trade with Europe? Do they support our entrance into the trans-Pacific partnership? Is this what the New Democrats are saying? Since they want to reduce and take off all the tariffs across the board, are they now finally free traders, and do they finally understand how important it is to have an economy that can trade with the rest of the world?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274383">NDP members support Canadian businesses and Canadian families, and when it comes to the tax increases that the Conservatives have put in this budget, we are not the only ones who are calling them out on this. The CEO of the Bank of Montreal had this to say, “One wonders if this doesn't potentially lead to even more of a problem on the price gap. I have to wonder if this isn't taking from one hand and piling on to the other...aggravating cross-border shopping.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274384"> If the Conservatives are talking about trade, we are not going to see much because we are going to have all of our Canadian consumers going over to the U.S. to buy products because they keep raising the tariffs, making things more expensive for those in Canada.</ParaText>

None of these facilities are operated by the private sector.  Budget 2012 was clear: the government has not built a single new prison since 2006 and has no intention of building any new prisons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274676">The government is committed to the idea that the work of guarding inmates should be performed by employees of the Government of Canada.  CSC currently uses some privatized services for the delivery of specialized, non-correctional programs and services, e.g., medical professionals and educational services, which are provided through contracts with the private sector. In addition, CSC does contract, or enter into agreements, with not-for-profit organizations and communities, which operate community residential facilities, also known as halfway houses, or healing lodges, or which provide a service to CSC.  </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274677">With regard to (a)(i) and (a)(iii), CSC had previously engaged in discussions with Public-Private Partnerships Canada, or PPP Canada, but has no plans to pursue the use of PPP.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="3274706">Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a), the government undertook several initiatives over the past decade that assessed the impacts of amendments to the Canada Grains Act, CGA, including market impacts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274707">The CGA required that an independent and comprehensive review of the CGA and the Canadian Grain Commission, CGC, be undertaken in 2006 in response to concerns that the CGC had not kept up with grain industry needs and to deal with long-standing funding issues. Compas Inc., contracted by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, AAFC, completed this review and tabled its report in the House of Commons on September 18, 2006. Compas Inc. recommended that inward inspection become optional and that the CGC’s inspection services be contracted out to reduce costs to the industry. Compas Inc. also recommended exploring alternative producer payment protection models that provide optimal security at optimal prices and clarity to producers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274708">The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, SCAAF, studied the Compas Inc. report and, in December 2006, tabled its own report outlining unanimous all-party recommendations. SCAAF recommended moving to optional inward inspection to reduce unnecessary regulations and costs. SCAAF also recommended that an alternative model for producer payment security be explored to reduce costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274709">The government attempted to act on these recommendations on two occasions prior to budget 2012. Unfortunately, members of Parliament from the NDP, the Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois colluded to prevent the passage of this legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274710">In 2010-12 the CGC consulted with producers and industry organizations regarding changes to its user fees, using consultation documents that included service descriptions and standards as well as proposed fees. Stakeholders responded that changes to the CGA were required before its user fees were updated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274711">In 2011 the working group on marketing freedom, established to advise the minister on the Canadian Wheat Board, CWB, recommended that an updated CGA would complement the proposed changes to the CWB. These reforms would serve to transform the Canadian grain sector to a more competitive, market-oriented environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274712">In 2012 the CGC asked for additional stakeholder feedback on possible changes to the CGA. Specifically, input was requested on the governance and mandate of the CGC, producer payment security, licensing, inspection and weighing, enforcement, and any other matter pertaining to the CGA. It was estimated that the elimination of CGC-provided inward inspection and weighing and the changes to producer payment protection would result in about $20 million in savings in CGC costs per year. Stakeholders, including producers, continued to request that the CGA be modernized to reduce costs for the sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274713">In 2012 the CGC conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed user fee regulations for the CGC’s updated services, based on changes to the CGA. This included an assessment of the costs and benefits of the elimination of CGC-provided inward inspection and weighing and registration and cancellation of elevator receipts. It was found that over a 15-year period, the net benefit of the changes to industry stakeholders, including producers, is a savings of $87.54 million for the elimination of CGC inward inspection and weighing and registration and cancellation of elevator receipts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274714">Officials from the CGC and AAFC appeared at SCAAF on November 6, 2012, to discuss these changes. Members of Parliament provided valuable feedback at that time. It should be noted that the committee and both Houses of Parliament agreed with the government’s approach and passed this legislation without amendment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274715">With regard to (b), the studies and consultations indicated that producers ultimately pay for any CGC services since the costs of these services are passed through grain companies on to farmers. Therefore, the impact of the projected net benefit of $87.54 million over a 15-year period for the elimination of CGC inward inspection and weighing and registration and cancellation of elevator receipts will ultimately benefit producers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274717">Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a), the CFIA continues to consider options for moving forward with these regulations and will need to conduct additional consultations prior to publishing regulations in Canada Gazette. Currently there are no draft regulations that are ready to be published.

              <ParaText id="3274721">Mr. Speaker, with regard to (a), (b), (c) and (d), Natural Resources Canada, NRCan, has not done a formal study or report on the economic impact of increasing Canada's refining capacity. However, we keep developments in the refining sector under constant observation.  In fact, NRCan has recently appeared before both parliamentary and Senate committees to provide insight on these matters. Canada has the second-highest refining capacity per capita among G8 countries; however, at 85% capacity utilization, it is currently experiencing significant overcapacity. This overcapacity is the result of a decline in North American demand for refined petroleum products.

</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274722">In Canada we have a market-based approach that relies on market forces to signal when and where new refining capacity should be built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274723">With regard to (e), the Government of Canada supports the construction of a west-to-east pipeline and notes that the private sector has brought forward two possible projects. Given Canada’s market-based approach to energy policy, NRCan believes that the industry is best placed to determine how to move crude oil to markets, whether it be by rail, pipeline, ship or other mode of transport. All proposals for such pipelines are required to submit a detailed application to the National Energy Board, NEB, the independent federal regulator, which will then conduct a comprehensive regulatory review that could include public hearings and the submission of evidence on issues relating to but not limited to socio-economics, environment and public safety. Through this review process, concerns and questions regarding the economic impacts of a west-east pipeline would be addressed.  </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274724">NRCan has extensive expertise and knowledge regarding the development of crude oil pipelines, oil markets, and the economics surrounding the development of oil and gas pipeline infrastructure in Canada. NRCan is able to support policy decisions concerning the development of energy infrastructure in Canada through the analysis and synthesis of information from many credible sources, including, but not limited to, internal reports and studies, publicly available reports and studies, academics, industry experts, non-governmental organizations and other governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274725">NRCan continuously analyzes retail gasoline prices across Canada and publishes extensive information on gasoline prices and the factors that influence gasoline prices. This material is publicly available at www.fuelfocus.nrcan.gc.ca.  The Fuel Focus report is published every two weeks, while gasoline price information is updated daily.

              <ParaText id="3274795">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a specific and important matter requiring urgent attention. Under Standing Order 52, I ask that, today, you grant my request for an emergency debate. Here are the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274796">For the first time in history, the Supreme Court has decided to launch an internal review after allegations that Laskin violated the fundamental rights and rules regarding the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The Supreme Court has confirmed that this is a serious situation. Yet, having the Supreme Court investigate itself will not demonstrate that we have an open and transparent justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274797">With regard to the information contained in the book <I>La bataille de Londres</I>, which was published last week, historian Frédéric Bastien stated—with evidence to support his statement—that former Supreme Court chief justice Bora Laskin provided information to Canadian and British government officials during Supreme Court deliberations on the legality of the plan to repatriate the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274798">What is more, another Supreme Court justice at that time, Willard Estey, also secretly exchanged information with London on the same topic in the fall of 1980. By so doing, these judges ignored the separation of powers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274799">The very operation of our democratic institutions is based on this fundamental principle of the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. These judges violated this rule by violating the confidentiality of the deliberations and by submitting themselves to the will of the executive branch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274800">The information contained in <I>La bataille de Londres</I> raises serious concerns that alone are enough to justify a public inquiry. Patrick Taillon, a law professor at Laval University, Benoît Pelletier, an expert on constitutional law and law professor at the University of Ottawa, and Henri Brun, a constitutional expert, have all come to the same conclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274801">Mr. Bastien and some analysts confirm that, by definition, this violation of the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive constitutes a <I>coup d'état</I>. “When a person violates a constitutional rule in the name of constitutional change, that is a <I>coup d'état</I>,” Mr. Bastien said. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274802">John Ford, who was the British high commissioner in Ottawa at the time, also described the situation as “a real attempt at a <I>coup d’état</I> in order to change the balance of powers within Confederation”. This quote is taken from correspondence between Ford and the British foreign affairs minister at the time, which Mr. Bastien obtained from the Foreign Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274803">In light of this new information, I ask for an emergency debate on this issue, which calls into question the integrity and independence of the Supreme Court, as well as the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, which form the very basis of democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274804">Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the attention that you will give to this request, which is fundamental to the trust that Canadians must have in the separation of powers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274807">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being allowed to speak to this question of privilege. It is the first opportunity I have had to speak to the point raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>, so I would like to add my thoughts for your consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274808">Speaking in the House of Commons is a fundamental right of members of this place. That is the most important starting point for all of us in this chamber. It is fundamental to what this chamber is all about. The real question in front of you, Mr. Speaker, on this question of privilege is really this: who gets to decide who speaks on the floor of this House? Is it the parliamentary party House leaders, the parliamentary party whips or is it you, the Speaker, who ultimately has the power of recognition? That really is the heart of the fundamental question that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> raised. It is the question as to whether or not you, as Speaker, still have the power of recognition over members' statements. The most important point to make in the context of this question of privilege is that the fundamental right of all members in this place is speech, the ability to use words to articulate points of view in this place, whether the members are independent members of Parliament not recognized as a parliamentary party, or whether they are members of Parliament who are part of recognized parliamentary parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274809"><I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, also affectionately known as “O'Brien and Bosc”, states:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">By far, the most important right accorded to Members of the House is the exercise of freedom of speech in parliamentary proceedings. It has been described as…a fundamental right without which they would be hampered in the performance of their duties. It permits them to speak in the House without inhibition, to refer to any matter or express any opinion as they see fit, to say what they feel needs to be said in the furtherance of the national interest and the aspirations of their constituents.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274811">It is the reason why members in this House enjoy immunity from libel and slander laws. It is the reason why it is a breach of a member's privilege to prevent a member from physically getting to this House to speak on the floor. It is a reason why all these privileges exist. It is for us to be able to speak freely on this floor of the people's place, the House of Commons. Speaking is what we do here. In a democracy, we do not solve our debates or disagreements through the tip of a sword or through violence. We solve them through words: words of praise, words of caution, words of criticism. That is why this question of privilege is so important. We settle debates in a democracy through words, and the ability of members to express those words on this floor is the heart of the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274812">Party whips and party House leaders for decades have served a coordinating and scheduling function as to who gets to speak on the floor of this House of Commons. They have played for decades the role of coordination and scheduling in terms of who gets to speak during debates and who gets to speak during other parts of Parliament's life. For example, during debate, the party's House leaders and the party whips coordinate among the three recognized parliamentary parties as to who is going to speak when during the debate, which members, and which rotation. However, if a member of a recognized parliamentary party caucus were to rise at the very end of that list of members that had been coordinated by the three recognized parliamentary parties, a member who had not yet spoken to the bill and who was not on the list that had been prepared by the respective parliamentary House leaders, you, Mr. Speaker, would recognize him or her, even if the party whip or the party House leader sent you a note in the chamber and said, “Do not recognize this member”. Why? Because it is a fundamental right for a member to rise in his or her spot to speak to the chamber.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274813">Unfortunately, over the decades the coordinating and scheduling function of party House leaders and party whips has shifted to that of a command and control function. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274814">I want to draw everyone's attention in the chamber to what has happened to question period over the last 30 years. Before the 1980s, any member of the House could pose a question of the government. After the leader's round was finished, any member of the chamber had the fundamental right to rise in his or her place and ask a question of the government, both opposition and government members. Therefore, six or seven members would pop up at once, like we do in questions and comments, to ask questions of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274815">After the introduction of television in 1977, a significant change to question period was introduced by Speaker Sauvé. According to Mr. Marleau, the former clerk of the House, in the interests of making things more orderly, the speaker decided to request lists of members from the respective parliamentary parties in order to better organize question period. This was done to assist the speaker in scheduling and coordinating which members were going to ask what questions during the 45 minutes of oral questions. It was not intended to serve as a stripping away of the power of recognition of the speaker to recognize or not recognize members during question period. It was not intended to give command and control over who got to ask questions during question period in the chamber, but  over the last 30 or so years, that is precisely what has happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274815">Today in the chamber, members of Parliament cannot ask questions of the government to hold it to account. They no longer have that fundamental right, whether they sit on that side of the aisle or on this side of the aisle. The only people who get to ask questions in the chamber during oral questions are those who are given approval by the House leader or party whips, who create these lists that are submitted to you, Mr. Speaker, before 2:15 p.m. on Monday through Thursday and before 11:15 on Friday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274817">Despite Speaker Jerome's ruling of April 14, 1975, that it is a right of members to put questions to the government during question period, today members of the House of Commons no longer have that right to ask questions of the government and to hold it to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274818">That shift from the early 1980s to the present during question period from a coordinating and scheduling function on the part of the House leaders and party whips for you,  to one of command and control over who gets to ask and answer questions in this place is instructive of the question in front of us today as to what we should do with members' statements. That shift has eroded the basic principle on which modern Canadian political institutions are based. That is the basic concept of responsible government, the idea that the executive branch of government is accountable back to the legislature and that members in the House have to play that fundamental role, including members in the government caucus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274819">This shift from scheduling and coordinating to command and control has stripped members of the right to ask questions during question period and is now threatening to do the same during members' statements. It has also eroded the power to hold the government to account, the fundamental concept of responsible government. It is something that our forebears felt important enough that a monument to Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin, figures in Canadian history in building these institutions, was erected behind Centre Block overlooking the Ottawa River, proclaiming responsible government in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274820">It is something that the rebellions of 1837 were all about, the idea that Crown prerogative was not unfettered and unchecked and that ultimately, the executive branch was accountable to the legislature. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274821">In short, the idea that the executive is accountable to members of a legislature is a fundamental underpinning of modern political institutions in Canada,  and the shift that has happened in question period and is starting to happen in members' statements is eroding this very fundamental principle. This shift, Mr. Speaker, has also eroded your power of recognition,  a corollary of which is your power of non-recognition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274822">Some in the chamber have argued that parties have the right to discipline members and that parties have the right to curtail members if they say something the party has not approved of, and I agree with that principle. I agree that parliamentary parties, parliamentary leadership, has the right to discipline members for saying things either in the chamber or outside the chamber of which they do not approve. That discipline could involve removing a member of a parliamentary committee. That discipline could involve removing a member as chair of a committee. That discipline could involve removing a member from his or her duties associated with Parliament. However, that discipline should take place after the fact of speaking in the chamber and, most important, that discipline cannot include preventing a member from speaking in the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274823">It is clear to me that there exists a case of privilege. I ask that you, Mr. Speaker, see it also and that you take over the scheduling of S. O. 31 members' statements from the party whips and  party house leaders, restore your powers of recognition during members' statements and strengthen the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274831">It is evident that members have certain privileges and immunities to allow the maximum use of this freedom of speech. Some members have risen to indicate to you, Mr. Speaker, that there have been occasions where they have been denied the opportunity to raise certain subject matters in their S. O. 31 statements. It is clear that the House considers it extremely important for an MP to have freedom of speech to the fullest extent possible and that this fullest extent would naturally extend to the freedom to raise a subject matter on which to speak, as one cannot utilize the freedom of speech privileges and immunities established in the House if one cannot rise to speak in the first place. I believe this highlights the importance of the S. O. 31 issue presently before you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274832">S. O. 31s are one of the only opportunities that a member of Parliament has to speak to a matter that is not constrained by a debate already before the House. For example, when debate is on a particular bill or motion, an MP cannot raise a completely unrelated matter. I know you are as generous as possible, Mr. Speaker, in allowing latitude in terms of an MP's remarks in debate, but if the matter raised by the MP is not germane to the debate, he or she would be ruled out of order. In other words, when an MP rises to speak in the House, his or her comments must be relevant to the matter in front of the House at that time except when giving an S. O. 31.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274833">The S. O. 31 offers a unique opportunity to an MP to speak on any matter and, as a result, MP privileges in this regard must be protected. Allow me to provide a concrete and relevant example of what I mean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274834">Last Thursday, March 28, the procedure and House affairs committee tabled a report in this place that rendered Motion No. 408 non-votable, a most surprising and disappointing determination. As the House knows, Motion No. 408 reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274835">
                <Quote>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274836">Mr. Speaker, as you know, there are clear criteria that have been established by the committee on procedure and House affairs by which bills and motions may be determined to be votable or non-votable. When Motion No. 408 is reviewed with respect to these criteria, one readily arrives at the conclusion that Motion No. 408 is votable and should have been deemed so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274837">Motion No. 408 being a motion and not a bill is an expression of condemnation, the type of which the House has expressed many times on a wide variety of issues. By inviting the House to condemn discrimination against females, Motion No. 408 is within the federal jurisdiction and it does not violate the Constitution Acts. An independent analyst, whose responsibility it is to research and be knowledgeable in these matters, was clear that Motion No. 408 did not concern questions that were substantially the same as ones already voted on by the House of Commons during this current session of Parliament. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> pointed out, no other piece of government or private member's business has called on Parliament to condemn discrimination against women and girls occurring through sex-selective pregnancy termination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274838">Last, I would point out that there is widespread support for a motion such as Motion No. 408, and I think we saw this when the CBC televised its program on the airways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274839">Motion No. 408 is the first motion of its kind. It clearly meets the criteria for votability and it is therefore votable, and herein lies the problem and the importance of freedom of speech for S. O. 31s. In short, I do not support the determination that Motion No. 408 is non-votable. It is important to note as well that this determination of non-votability infringes on my right to vote on a matter before the House that should be votable. In fact, the right to vote on a matter is the natural extension of the right to freedom of speech. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274840">In one sense, voting for or against a motion or bill is the final word in a debate. It is a decisive action upon a matter before the House, an action that is deliberately taken once all is said and done, so to speak. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274841">Motion No. 408 should be votable and I believe many Canadians and members in this place know it should indeed be votable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274842">As I mentioned, the determination of non-votability infringes upon the natural conclusion of freedom of speech, that of being able to vote on a matter. Because of this, it is my hope that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> will appeal this determination of Motion No. 408 being non-votable to the House so MPs may reflect upon their rights and privileges and correct what has taken place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274843">The matter I have just spoken to relates to S. O. 31s, in that I am now receiving correspondence from constituents asking my view on this matter. Do I agree or disagree with the determination of non-votability? Do I defend this decision? Have I spoken publicly on this? This is indeed the challenge. If I were not to speak on this matter, it would be reasonable for my constituents to assume that I support the finding of non-votability, when this is clearly not the case. This would apply to my colleagues in all parties if they too disagreed with Motion No. 408 being declared non-votable and were prevented from saying so in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274844">Today I am fortunate to participate in the question of privilege raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>, but if there were no relevant question of privilege before the House, the only other opportunity to raise such a matter would be in an S. O. 31 statement. For this reason, a member of Parliament must have maximum freedom of speech in speaking to an issue such as this, but more important, being able to raise it in the first place. I say this because it is conceivable that, if a member were prevented from being able to speak about Motion No. 408 itself, it is equally conceivable that they could also be prevented from speaking about their views on the non-votability of Motion No. 408.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274845"> It would indeed be an infringement on the rights and privileges of a member of Parliament if members were not able to rise to clarify their position on such important matters, or to give voice to the concerns of their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274846">Lastly, it is possible for the current S. O. 31 convention to change and I would suggest that it would be possible for you to manage S. O. 31s in the same way as you do petitions, Mr. Speaker. When the time comes to table petitions, it is you, Mr. Speaker, who recognizes MPs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274847"> As Speaker, I have noted you very capably find the appropriate balance by rotating between members of different parties. I also note there is no pre-screening of petitions before they are tabled. A member simply rises and when recognized, tables a petition, and it can be on any subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274848">I conclude by stating that I support the question of privilege raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> and that members must be afforded the greatest opportunity in latitude in being able to raise important matters and fully represent those Canadians they have been elected to represent.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3274851">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the NDP's high-tax agenda. It is shameful that the NDP, which has voted against every single tax cut we have introduced since 2006, would question our government's record on keeping taxes low with today's motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274852">Moreover, to suggest the NDP, if given the opportunity, is not planning to raise taxes on Canadians or Canadian families is simply preposterous. It is and it will, starting with a $21 billion carbon tax. In contrast, our Conservative government has a proven track record of success when it comes to supporting families, individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. One aspect of this support is our government's commitment to keep taxes low. We strongly believe that lower taxes for families, individuals and businesses fuel job creation, economic growth and long-term prosperity. Small and medium-sized businesses are vital to Canada's economic success. When businesses pay less tax, they can grow and create more high-quality jobs for Canadians, the kinds of jobs necessary to compete in the 21st century economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274853">Furthermore, our Conservative government believes in leaving more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadian families. By doing this, the government gives Canadian families more flexibility in making the choices that are right for them. Indeed, since 2006, we have cut taxes more than 150 times, reducing the overall tax burden to its lowest level in a half century. This is no exaggeration. We have cut taxes in every way government collects them. This includes personal taxes, consumption taxes, business taxes, excise taxes and much more, making Canada a magnet for new jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274854">Since the NDP does not seem to realize this and seems to have forgotten that it voted against all of those tax reductions, I will take a few moments to highlight some of these measures. Since 2006, we cut the lowest personal income tax rate to 15%; we increased the amount Canadians can earn without paying tax; we reduced the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%, putting an estimated $1,000 back in the pockets of an average family; we introduced and enhanced the working income tax benefit; and we introduced the tax-free savings account, the most important personal savings vehicle since RRSPs. The list goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274855">Now the NDP might be asking, “You have cut taxes, but are tax cuts good for Canadian families?” Interestingly enough, the leader of the NDP does not really believe tax cuts are all that important to Canadians. In fact, back in 2007, after we cut the GST to 5%, he said, “I don't think the average Canadian is going to see that much of a change”. The leader of the NDP could not have been more wrong. Canadian families like low taxes, not high NDP taxes. The NDP should take note of the measures I have just described, as well as the other tax-reduction measures our government has introduced. Indeed, the leader of the NDP might be interested to know that as a result of these measures, a typical family of four is saving over $3,200 in taxes each year. Not only that, but this has helped remove more than one million low-income Canadians from the tax rolls. I am sure those one million Canadians notice a change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274856">I am sure Canadian seniors noticed a change. Indeed, since 2007, over $2.7 billion in annual tax relief has been provided to seniors and pensioners. These include introducing pension income splitting, increasing the age credit amount by $2,000, doubling the pension income credit to $2,000, increasing the amount the GIS recipients can earn through employment without any reduction in GIS benefits, increasing the age limit for RRSPs to RRIF conversion to 71 from 69, introducing the largest GIS increase in more than 25 years, and much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274857">Overall, we have removed more than 380,000 seniors from the tax rolls. In fact, a single senior can earn at least $19,892 and a senior couple at least $39,784 before paying any federal income tax. That is a proven record behind which I am happy to stand.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274858"> I would much rather take that record to Canadians than try to justify imposing a $21 billion carbon tax that would raise the price of everything Canadians buy, everything from gas to hydro to groceries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274859">I will never understand why the NDP's answer to everything is tax, tax, tax. On this side of the House, we believe in low taxes and keeping more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadians and their families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274860">One way to keep taxes low is ensuring that all corporations and Canadians pay their fair share of taxes. That is why our government has been diligent both at home and abroad to ensure everyone pays their fair share of taxes and to crack down on those few who attempt to game the system or break the rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274861">Since 2006, and including measures proposed in economic action plan 2013, our government has introduced more than 75 measures to improve the integrity of our tax system. The tax loopholes we are closing would amount to over $2.5 billion in 2013-14 and more than $2.6 billion in 2014-15. Not only would this help keep Canada's tax rates competitive and low but it would keep Canada's tax system fair and equitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274862">To be clear, we would be closing tax loopholes that a select few are exploiting to avoid paying taxes. Why would the NDP stand up for tax cheats? Loopholes do not serve an economic purpose. They do not grow our economy and they do not put people back to work. Why would the NDP stand up for tax cheats? By closing loopholes and putting an end to this type of exploitation, we can keep taxes low for Canadian families, seniors and businesses. Why does the NDP stand up for tax cheats?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274863">Our government uses a variety of tools to identify and combat international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. Economic action plan 2013 proposes a number of measures to enhance the CRA's ability to track down international tax cheats. Specifically, our government announced the stop international tax evasion program, a program that would allow CRA to pay individuals who have knowledge of major international tax non-compliance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274864">In addition, Canada has one of the most extensive tax treaty networks in the world, with 90 tax treaties and 16 tax information exchange agreements now in force, 3 other TIEAs signed and another 11 TIEAs under active negotiation. Through these agreements our government would make sure that everyone, whether at home or abroad, pays their fair share. That is the bottom line, and it is the right thing to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274865">Unfortunately, the flaws with the NDP motion do not stop there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274866">In tabling the motion, the NDP has demonstrated a clear lack of understanding around how tariffs actually work, as well as the action our government has taken to reduce tariffs and expand our pro-trade agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274867">Let me begin by highlighting our government's record on tariff reduction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274868">Since 2009, our government has eliminated close to 1,900 tariffs and concluded 6 free trade agreements. Not only is this providing $590 million in annual tariff relief for Canadian consumers and businesses, but this action made Canada the first G20 country to become a tariff-free zone for manufacturers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274869">However our tariff reductions do not stop there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274870">Economic action plan would build on our government's strong record of reducing tariffs for consumers and retailers by announcing the elimination of tariffs on baby clothing, hockey gear and most sports and exercise equipment. Overall this would translate into $76 million in savings, a move welcomed by the president and CEO of the Retail Council of Canada who referred to these changes as “a win-win-win for consumers”. That is what I call real action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274871">Switching gears for a moment, I would be remiss if I did not take this time to clear the air on the issue of iPods and MP3 players, an issue the NDP clearly does not seem to understand. To be absolutely clear, there is no iPod tax; there never was and there certainly never will be under this government. Let me say it again: MP3 players, iPods and devices of this sort would continue to come into Canada duty-free. That is the way it was before economic action plan 2013, and that is the way it would continue to be after economic action plan 2013.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274872">Instead of spreading lies, the New Democrats should do their homework and be honest with the Canadian people. Unfortunately, we have seen this before with the NDP, always eager to cast allegations of hypocrisy and lies without checking the facts. Well I have checked the facts, and the simple fact is that the opposition parties are the only ones pushing for an iPod tax. This just shows their lack of understanding of how tariffs work, including the general preferential tariff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274873">Allow me to dedicate some of the time I have left to enlighten my NDP colleagues on how the GPT operates. With respect to the GPT, let me be clear. This is a foreign aid program that was introduced in the 1970s to help the world's developing countries. At its foundation, this program was designed to help developing countries increase their exports. I do not think anyone in this House would deny that the world is very different today from 40 years ago. It is for that reason that many of the countries initially part of this program no longer need preferential access to Canada's market to grow their economies. For example, countries like Brazil, Russia, India and China have developed substantially over the past 40 years and today boast economies that are highly competitive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274874">I should note that this does not mean we are getting rid of this program. The GPT will provide incentives for Canadians to import from more than 100 countries remaining as beneficiaries of the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274875">What does this mean? It means more support for the poorest countries and more incentives for other countries to sign free trade agreements with Canada; so in addition to the creation of jobs, this highlights yet another reason why our government has pursued an aggressive free trade agenda. I ask that the New Democrats listen to the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters association on a recent edition of CTV's <I>Question Period</I>, when it stated:</ParaText>

This is a government that in general has been getting rid of tariffs, but we had to update the general preferential tariff. I mean it's 39 years since we updated it. It was meant to help developing countries...we were giving them preferential tariffs while their per capita GDP is higher than Canada's. The solution is what the government is doing, trying to negotiate free trade agreements with countries around the world so that we not only drop our tariffs but they drop their tariffs as well.... ...we're pushing the government to negotiate trade agreements that provide reciprocal benefits to both Canada and our trading partner.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274877">I should note that since 2006 our government has implemented six free trade agreements with nine countries, free trade that the NDP has opposed. Why is the NDP ideologically opposed to free trade? Is it because it expands markets for Canadian business and creates more jobs for Canadians, or is it because it provides consumers with cheaper goods? As a matter of fact, these trade agreements have resulted in the elimination of some $63 million in annual tariffs on imports from these countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274878">Given this, can members imagine what benefits we could realize through a free trade agreement between Canada and Europe? In fact, it is estimated that such an agreement would eliminate an additional $750 million in annual tariffs on imports from the EU. However, again the NDP is opposed. Indeed, the NDP's Canada–U.S. border critic backed the Canadian Auto Workers union's call to end trade negotiations altogether with the European Union. Once more, we have proof positive that the New Democrats have no interest in creating more jobs for Canadians or reducing the cost of goods for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274879"> It is very clear that keeping taxes low is a central element of Canada's economic action plan. Economic action plan 2013 is the next chapter in our government's long-term plan to strengthen the Canadian economy in an uncertain world and create jobs and growth while keeping taxes low for families and businesses, all while balancing the budget by 2015, and nothing shrinks deficits faster than a growing economy. To be clear, we will take no advice from the brothers and sisters in the NDP who believe we can tax our way to prosperity. In fact, they should think again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274880">Just this past weekend, the New Democrats had Joe Stiglitz, an economist from the U.S., speak at their convention. This is the same Joe Stiglitz who said that Greece in 2010 was having a “short-term liquidity” problem, claiming that Greece would not ever be in default.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274883">The measures our government has introduced since 2006 are not driven by politics. Our government remains focused on what matters most to Canadians: jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. That is the bottom line.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274885">What is interesting is that the minister would not have even had to raise all of these taxes on Canadians if he had watched his own spending. I will give an example.</ParaText>

There are so many falsehoods in his remarks that I do not even know where to begin, but let me start by saying that the current regime of general preferential tariffs that Canada has in place was negotiated in 1972, which was a very different year and time from 2013. The countries of India, China and Brazil were developing economies at that time. The GPT is a foreign aid program. As those countries have now developed, the Canadian taxpayer should not be subsidizing the manufactured goods of China, India and Brazil for import into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274889">For example, the United States renegotiates its general preferential tariff agreements every two years.

              <ParaText id="3274892">Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that in the 1990s, during booming economic times, when the unemployment level never fell below 7.2% during that decade when the Liberals were in power, they chose to balance the budget on the backs of Canada's seniors, students and children by gutting our social programs and moving them to the responsibility of the provinces and gutting the employment insurance program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274893">We have no lessons to learn from the Liberal Party. In fact, in 2005, when we proposed $1,200—that is $100 a month—for child care, it was the Liberal Party that said, “Don't give people $25 a week to blow on beer and popcorn”. </ParaText>

New Democrats are tax-fighters all right, but they are fighting for higher taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274905">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170119" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> this afternoon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274906">I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="190572" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> for putting forward this motion for debate today for a couple of reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274907">First, the motion goes to the heart of what we as the official opposition are meant to be doing in the House, which is holding the government to account for the promises that it made to Canadians and identifying promises gone unfulfilled or breaches of promises made. This is a government with such little respect for Canadians and for the truth that there is no shortage of these. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274908">In this instance, I am talking about the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise not to raise taxes and his breach of that promise, a breach repeated by his finance minister while tabling the budget and, in turn, by his parliamentary secretary. Budget 2013 contains almost $8 billion of tax increases on nearly 1,300 types of goods, from hospital parking to bicycles to baby strollers to coffee makers to other goods and services, including MP3 players and iPods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274909">Second, the motion invites us to talk about what could be done, about what would be possible if only we had a government with some sense of policy innovation or creativity, if only we had a government with an eye to the future of this country, or if only we had a government that was sufficiently humble to look at what other governments are doing around the world as those governments turn their eyes to the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274910">I want to take a look this afternoon at just one of the almost 1,300 consumer products that are going to become more expensive because of the tax increases in this budget. That product is the bike. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274911">It is estimated that the cost to Canadians as a result of the government increasing the tariff on bicycles from 8% to 13% will be in the range of $5 million to $6 million annually. It is, in fact, a $5 million to $6 million disincentive to a healthy, active, environmentally friendly form of transportation at precisely the time when cities across this country—including, if not especially, my own city of Toronto—are struggling enormously with the very costly and frustrating combination of traffic congestion and underfunded, and consequently overcrowded, public transit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274912">When we as a country are struggling with a high and growing rate of obesity and chronic diseases related to obesity and the world is hurtling toward a radically different future owing to greenhouse gas emissions and the consequent climate change—a problem the government refuses to even acknowledge, much less address—enter the bicycle, the modest bike, as at least part of the solution to these issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274913">I have spoken many times in the House about the economic implications of traffic congestion in Toronto. As of 2006, Toronto's traffic congestion was estimated to cost the economy about $6 billion per year in lost productivity. The Toronto Region Board of Trade has further reported that this cost will increase to $15 billion by 2030 in the absence of some significant change. The members of the Toronto Region Board of Trade identify the issue as their greatest concern. It is a problem that ought to be addressed, and quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274914">With respect to the issue of health, Toronto Public Health's 2012 report, entitled “Road to Health: Improving Walking and Cycling in Toronto”, advises that 70% of Torontonians commute by car. Toronto Public Health further advises that about 55% of all trips in Toronto are less than seven kilometres and are therefore conducive to cycling. We know that physical activity aids in preventing or ameliorating a number of conditions, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Collectively, improved health leads to lower health care costs, and Toronto Public Health estimates that savings in direct medical costs arising from citizens engaging in active forms of transit such as walking and cycling would provide a further economic benefit of $110 million to $160 million each year in Toronto alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274915">The environmental impact of Toronto's traffic congestion is huge. For every litre of gas burned, approximately 2.4 kilograms of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere. That adds up quickly in a city of nearly three million people stuck in traffic.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274916">Data from the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group shows that Toronto emits 29.1 million tonnes annually of CO<Sub>2</Sub> alone. Of that amount, 35% comes from transportation. It is by no means just a Toronto problem. Countries and cities around the world are confronting the same challenges and making their own unfortunate contributions to climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274917">However, countries around the world are also recognizing that within the simple, modest bicycle is embedded great opportunities to mitigate these challenges. In part, the response has been one of investing in cycling infrastructure. Denmark is a prime example. In April 2012, Denmark opened its new bicycle superhighway to facilitate commutes between Copenhagen and its outer suburbs. The first of 26 such planned routes, it aims to encourage more and more citizens to choose cycling over other methods of travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274918">The city of London, England, is on a similar path. About his revolutionary cycling plan for the city, London's mayor said “Cycling will be treated not as a niche...but what it is: an integral part of the transport network”. London's transport commissioner adds “this is about so much more than routes for cyclists. It is about the huge health and economic benefits that cycling can bring”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274919">It is in part at least, with an eye to the economic benefits, that a number of countries have implemented plans to make cycling, in fact, less expensive. That is the opposite of what the government is doing with budget 2013. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274920">In 2009, for example, Ireland initiated a national cycle to work program. This program provides a way for employers and employees to receive tax breaks for getting out of cars and onto bikes as their means for commuting to work. Under the program, the benefit, that is the bicycle itself, is not subject to a benefit in kind taxation. Employees can save up to 52% of the cost of the bike, while employers save about 11% in pay related social insurance contributions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274921"> The United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark and cities in other countries have similar and similarly named programs to incent cycling as a form of commuting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274922">A study done by the Irish Bicycle Business Association called the scheme in Ireland a “massive success” measured against a number of different criteria, including benefits to local economies and, importantly, net revenue benefit to the government. This was mainly through increases in sales tax revenues from increased bike sales, safety accessories sales and servicing and income tax revenues from job creation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274923"> I noted in a recent column by Lisa Rochon, the architecture critic for  <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, about the values of young people living in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary, that the issue of bike lanes was identified as one of a number of urban features of great importance to the millennial generation. It is reflective of a new way that they want to live in, own and experience their urban environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274924">That all of this escapes the Conservative government is reflective of a government that is a poor economic manager, one that fails to understand or care about cities and how they work and one that is deaf to voices young and old alike who want to talk about the future, what the future looks like and what we need to do now to preserve a healthy and prosperous one for coming generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274925">Some might say that I have made too much of the bicycle here today. It is, after all, just one of about 1,300 consumer goods that would be made more expensive to Canadians under budget 2013. However, the modest bike represents opportunities for economic growth and productivity, along with healthier living, healthier cities and a healthier planet.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274940">It has already been mentioned on a number of occasions in the House that, once again, this government has broken its promises to Canadians. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> had promised that Canadians would not have to pay any new taxes under a Conservative government. Just recently, the <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> challenged us to find tax increases in his budget. People took on the challenge and looked at the budget. Their findings were very troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274941">The Conservatives' budget 2013 is actually filled with tax and tariff hikes on more than 1,200 types of product, which will hit Canadian families right in their wallets. We are talking about bicycles, baby strollers, shoes, clothes, coffee makers, plastic school supplies, iPods, hospital parking and so on. It is all fair game. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274942">Because of this government's misguided economic decisions, Canadians will have to take on an additional tax burden of nearly $8 billion over the next five years. Eight billion dollars. Once again, we are confronted with the Conservatives' bad faith and hypocrisy when it comes to the economy. However, does this really come as a surprise to us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274943">Since the beginning of this debate, the beginning of their mandate in fact, the Conservatives have been trying to confuse Canadians and obscure the facts. Unable to defend their record and justify their bad decisions, they prefer to spend millions of dollars of public money to spread their propaganda and demonize the opposition parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274944">As I was listening to the Conservatives' presentations this afternoon, I felt I was back in a McCarthy-era hearing or in the middle of a witch hunt for communists worthy of the 1950s. Their rhetoric was incredibly demagogic, but they were not able to justify why they were going after Canadian families in this way. It is easy to blame the opposition parties for all the wrongs and accuse them of not wanting to co-operate with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274945">How can we support the decisions of a government that brings in those types of measures, which directly and negatively affect our Canadian families?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274946">The Conservatives spent all day accusing the NDP of wanting a carbon tax. This accusation is refuted almost daily in newspapers across the country. I find it rather ironic to hear a number of Conservative members talking about freedom of speech and the right to speak and asking that these be upheld in the House. They rise every chance they get to spout half-truths or facts made up right in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office, without even thinking twice about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274947">That is what we have seen in the House again today. They want their freedom of expression, but as soon as they have it, they are not prepared to use it properly and intelligently to clearly explain the truth to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274948">They are going to bring in taxes on nearly all goods that Canadian families consider necessities. They would have us believe that Canada's general preferential tariff for developing countries is a program that financed foreign companies, but Canadians are not stupid. They know the truth and know that this government would rather put its friends' interests ahead of the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274949">Since the Conservatives won a majority, it has become increasingly clear to Canadians that they cannot trust this government. In 2010, the Minister of Industry and the Minister of Heritage proudly declared:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274953">The exemption that currently exists under law, that applies to certain imported products and that could have prevented this unfortunate situation, does not really apply to this type of product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274954">Eligibility for this exemption is prohibitively expensive, and applying for the exemption requires the importer to obtain a signed certificate from every user, therefore every consumer. This certificate has to indicate their name, address, occupation, and even what they use the merchandise for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274955">For a party that constantly boasts about wanting to cut red tape for our Canadian businesses, it seems rather absurd to want to subject importers to such an administrative burden just so that they can keep telling Canadians that there is no tax on iPods. That is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274956">Sony Canada, to name just one company, has already warned Canadian consumers that they can expect the price of this type of device to go up by 5% to 6%, because this so-called exemption is not realistically applicable in this situation. This is just one example of tariff increases in disguise in the Conservatives' recent budget. Unfortunately, there are many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274957">These tax increases will affect the wallets of thousands of Canadians and will also have a major impact on Canadian businesses, which will have a harder time competing with their U.S. competitors, as the cross-border price gap continues to widen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274958">A number of my colleagues who live in border regions across the country are already seeing this happen, and the changes have not even come into effect yet. We can only imagine the repercussions that these new tariff barriers will have on the Canadian economy when they actually come into force. That is when we might see some very unfortunate consequences for a number of regions in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274959">Another troubling aspect of budget 2013 is without question the application of GST and HST on parking lots that were previously exempt, such as school and hospital parking lots. This is an example of a tax that did not exist before and will be applied as a result of this Conservative government and its 2013-14 budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274960">We hear them say that they are keeping their promises and that they are not increasing taxes, but the example we are providing here is very clear. They are eliminating an exemption simply to apply a new tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274961">One of the factors restricting access to health care services in our country is certainly the expenses related to a hospital visit, particularly parking costs. We do not yet know how much revenue the government hopes to take in with this new tax, but we do know that it will directly affect thousands of vulnerable Canadians and families that are facing hard times. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274962">Last week, in my riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, I had the opportunity to meet the families representing the latest Leucan shaved head challenge. I met the parents of two children in my riding who fought cancer and overcame it. These parents were courageous enough to devote their time and energy to helping other families facing the same challenges they faced. We had the chance to speak at length. They told me of their journey, filled with obstacles. It required perseverance and caused a lot stress within the family. As you can well imagine, they spent countless hours at the hospital to ensure that their children received the care they needed. Just imagine the cost of these numerous trips to the hospital. Then add the rising costs of parking and the wigs given to those fighting cancer. These taxes will directly affect those families and people going through extremely difficult situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274963">This is not the first time the Conservatives have broken their promises to Canadians, and if nothing changes, it will not be the last. We need to do better for Canadian families, and that is what the NDP is trying to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274964">Instead of raising the taxes of honest Canadians who are working hard and paying their fair share into the system, it is time this government stopped breaking its promises and reversed its bad decision to stick Canadian families with nearly $8 billion in new taxes. It is unacceptable that the government is so proud of its unwavering support for big business and big oil, providing them with excessive tax breaks while forcing these tariffs on Canadians.</ParaText>

Clearly, my Conservative colleague just does not get it. For the benefit of all my colleagues—who should be listening to the interpretation in order to ensure that they understand correctly—a regressive tax is one that hits those with low incomes much harder than it does those with higher incomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274969">That means the middle class, as well as small and medium-sized businesses, will be hit particularly hard by the changes to the tariffs, as established. I would like my colleague to comment and give her opinion on this situation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274971">A 15% hike on a specific product will have much more of an impact on low-income households than it will on wealthier ones. Tariff hikes—even small ones—will make it much harder to get these necessary consumer products. Perhaps a 3% hike does not mean much and will not make a very big difference to the monthly budgets of the wealthy, but such is not the case for middle-class families with lower incomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274972">The Conservatives often tell us that they have already proposed a number of measures to help families. Yet what they propose 99% of the time are tax credits that do not help low-income families because they are not eligible for them. On top of being unable to benefit from the help that the Conservatives are trying to give, as minimal as it may be, families will now have to spend even more to continue to accomplish their daily tasks and meet their needs. That is completely unacceptable. </ParaText>

That is really and truly what it is. Some might argue it is indirect. Some might argue that it is not a tax increase; that being the Conservatives. However, at the end of the day, government revenues are going to be increasing by $300 million because the government has made the decision to put a tariff increase on 1,300-plus items.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3274976">Indeed, the NDP has been talking about this from the beginning. If you read the motion, that is exactly what it says. We are talking about a tax hike. I said so in my speech. Parking at hospitals and schools was tax-exempt. However, the government is introducing a new tax. As for tariff increases, they are another form of hidden taxes. Just because it is not specifically called a tax does not mean that is not what it is, considering the very real impact of these measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274977">There are other ways the government could go about increasing revenues to replenish its coffers. Since the NDP became the official opposition, we have been working hard on the whole issue of tax havens. We are asking the government once again to do something to recover the money that is being hidden outside the country, money that should be used for the benefit of honest Canadians who pay into our system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274978">The government could also cut back drastically on the tax breaks it gives the oil companies and big banks, which do not need them. There are ways of finding money. The government could have reviewed the F-35 contract a lot sooner and saved loads of money there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274979">There are many things the government could be doing differently in this country to replenish its coffers and guarantee Canadians the services they need, without digging directly into their pockets in such a hypocritical matter, as it is doing right now.</ParaText>

As law enforcement works to determine responsibility for this terrible tragedy, we extend our support to the men and women in emergency services who are working tirelessly to help those in need. Our thoughts and prayers are with our American friends and their families at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274981">I appreciate this time to speak to the opposition motion and speak against the high tax agenda of the NDP. Let us be clear from the start. The NDP supports higher taxes on Canadians. It has opposed our low tax agenda. The facts also show in no uncertain terms that the economic action plan 2013 and our low tax agenda are the right steps in building on our record of creating jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity while keeping taxes low for families and businesses and balancing the budget by 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274982">Let us look at the facts. Unlike the tax-and-spend NDP opposition, we do not believe Canadians should pay more taxes. Since coming to office in 2006 our Conservative government has taken action that leaves more money in the pockets of Canadians. Today a typical family is receiving more than $3,200 in extra tax savings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274983">How did we accomplish this? Rather than listening to the NDP who would hike taxes on businesses and entrepreneurs by $10 billion a year and impose a new carbon tax, we did it with real actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274984">For example, we fulfilled our commitment to reduce the GST to 5% from 7%, benefiting all Canadians, even those who do not earn enough to pay personal income tax. At the same time we have maintained the GST credit level, translating into more than $1.1 billion in GST credit benefits annually for low- and modest-income Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274985">We have increased the amount that all Canadians can earn without paying federal income tax. We have reduced the lowest personal income tax rate to 15% from 16% and increased the amount of income that individuals can earn before facing higher tax rates by increasing the upper limit of the two lowest personal income tax brackets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274986">We have introduced the tax-free savings account, the TFSA, a flexible, registered, general purpose savings vehicle that allows Canadians to earn tax-free investment income to more easily meet their lifetime savings needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274987">We have provided further support to students and their families by exempting scholarship income from taxation, introducing the textbook tax credit, and making registered education savings plans more responsive to changing needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274988">Our government has introduced the public transit tax credit to encourage public transit use and the volunteer firefighters tax credit to better support communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274989">We introduced the universal child care benefit, which provides $100 per month to families for each child under the age of six.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274990">We introduced and enhanced the working income tax benefit, lowering the welfare wall and strengthening work incentives for low-income Canadians already working while encouraging other low-income Canadians to enter the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274991">Our government has increased the amount of income that families can earn before the national child benefit supplement is fully phased out and before the Canada child tax base benefit begins to be phased out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274992">We introduced the tradesperson's tools deduction, which allows tradespersons to deduct from their income part of the costs of the tools they must acquire as a condition of employment, benefiting more than 25,000 tradespersons in 2010 alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274993">We brought in the apprenticeship job creation tax credit to encourage employers to hire new apprentices in eligible trades by providing a tax credit of 10% of the wages payable to eligible apprentices in the first two years of their apprenticeship program, benefiting more than 10,000 businesses in 2010.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3274994">Canadians at all income levels are benefiting from these tax reductions, with low- and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionately greater relief. Overall, personal income taxes are now 11% lower with the tax relief provided by the government, and more than one million low-income Canadians have been removed from the tax rolls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274995">In total, our government will have provided almost $160 billion in tax relief for Canadian families and individuals in just six short years. Our government has introduced more than 150 tax relief measures since 2006, bringing the overall federal tax burden to its lowest point in 50 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274996">What do these 150 measures have in common besides helping to keep more money in the pockets of Canadians? The NDP voted against every single one of them. Each and every time our Conservative government moved to lower taxes, the NDP stood in this Parliament and voted no. This is all on the public record. This is a fact. The NDP is a party of high taxes, taking more and more money from the pockets of Canadians. Our Conservative government is the party of low taxes, keeping money in the pockets of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274997"> Economic action plan 2013 builds on this unprecedented record of tax savings for Canadians with measures that will provide $76 million in annual tariff relief on baby clothing and sports and athletic equipment to reduce the gap in retail prices Canadian consumers pay compared to those in the U.S. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274998">Economic action plan 2013 also promotes adoption by enhancing the adoption expense tax credit to better recognize the cost of adopting a child. It expands tax relief for home care services to better meet the health care needs of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3274999">These tax reductions help individuals and families, with greater flexibility to make the choices that are right for them. They help build a solid foundation for future economic growth, more jobs and higher living standards for Canadians. I would encourage the NDP to stop opposing these measures and support economic action plan 2013 so that we can continue putting money back into the pockets of Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275000">While the opposition wants to raise taxes and kill jobs, our government is also focused on lowering taxes for Canadian manufacturers and businesses. These lower taxes will help them succeed in the global economy and will provide support to the individuals, families and communities that depend on them. These broad-based tax reductions are supporting investment and growth by delivering more than $60 billion in tax relief to job-creating businesses over a six-year period, ending in 2013-14. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275001">Our government has reduced the business tax rate, eliminated the federal capital tax and provided an incentive for provinces to eliminate their own general capital taxes. The last provincial general capital tax was eliminated in 2012.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275002"> We are leaving more money in the hands of entrepreneurs and businesses so that they can grow and hire more Canadians, unlike the NDP, which would simply want to hike taxes by $10 billion a year. Canada now has an overall tax rate on new business investment that is the lowest in the G7 and is below the average of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275003">We have increased the capital tax allowance rate for manufacturing and processing buildings and have introduced a temporary accelerated capital tax allowance for manufacturing or processing machinery and equipment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275004"> We have expanded the scope of the accelerated capital cost allowance for clean energy generation and conservation equipment so that a broader range of applications and technologies qualify for this measure. We have extended this temporary incentive until 2020. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275005">We have eliminated more than 1,800 tariffs on imported machinery, equipment and manufacturing inputs, thus providing $450 million in annual tariff savings and making Canada the first tariff-free zone for industrial manufacturers in the G20. These steps have established an international tax advantage that has allowed Canadian businesses to create jobs and drive economic growth. </ParaText>

Responsible fiscal management assures the sustainability of public services and low tax rates for future generations, while providing room to manoeuvre in the event of an adverse development across our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275023">Our government is committed to returning to balanced budgets by 2015 and will focus on what it can control in order to achieve this result. Such a commitment explains why, alone among the G7 countries, Canada continues to receive the highest possible credit ratings and a stable outlook from all the major credit rating agencies. Among global investors, Canada has a well-earned reputation for building an internationally competitive tax regime and for responsible fiscal, economic and financial sector management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275024">In conclusion, today's NDP motion, which attacks economic action plan 2013, is shameful when we consider Canada's record of achievement and the actions we have taken to lower taxes for Canadians. I would therefore encourage hon. members to not only reject the NDP's high-tax agenda but to support the timely passage of economic action plan 2013 so that it can continue to deliver tax relief for Canadians.</ParaText>

In the last election, the Conservatives promised not to raise Canadians' taxes. They are doing quite the opposite. In fact, the tax hike on more than 1,200 types of goods will have a huge impact on consumers' budgets, especially families' budgets. These tax hikes will also hurt Canadian businesses, which will find it even more difficult to compete with their American competitors.</ParaText>

They have become obsolete, quite frankly. We are talking about countries that no longer have third-world status. We are talking about countries such as China. China is an aggressive trading partner.

              <ParaText id="3275032">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170479" Type="2">York Centre</Affiliation> said that the Liberals in 2005, in critiquing the Conservative plan at the time to give families of young children $1,200 a year for child care, had said, “Do not give people $25 a week to blow on beer”.The person who made that statement at the time was an aide to the Prime Minister, who then publicly apologized, and for the record, the Prime Minister at the time, Paul Martin, said, with respect to the Conservative plan, and I think the House needs to have that on the record, “They are going to use that money in a way that I am sure is responsible.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3275054">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on this opposition day motion which is a very important one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275055">The core of the matter is what we see in budget 2013 is the Conservatives are raising taxes even though they promised Canadians that they would not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275056">I have a quote here from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said, “As long as I will be prime minister...there will be no new taxes.” I assume that leadership conventions are not finished yet, and that there will be one on the other side of the House sometime before 2015, if he is in fact true to his word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275057">The Conservatives promised that there would not be any new taxes, but of course they are increasing taxes on a whole host of things. I will be mentioning some of them. There is even a new tax, HST on parking at municipal parking lots and at hospitals. People who go to visit a loved one or who go to the hospital for some service will now be paying HST on parking services. The list goes on. There are really two reasons, and I do not know if they have been touched upon during the debate today. The first question is, “Why are the Conservatives raising taxes?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275058">I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170673" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275059">Why are the Conservatives raising taxes when they are cutting everywhere else? One would think that the Conservatives would not have to raise taxes because the cuts are so deep. I will use one example here. According to FedNor's website, $23.6 million less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275060">Last year, the Conservatives announced they were getting rid of some initiatives, including the LIC grant program. That used to provide up to $5,000 for non-profits, including municipalities. I know that one of our communities, Atikokan in my riding, took advantage of that grant to update their website to help promote business and their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275061">Those things have all disappeared. The first question is, “Why are the Conservatives raising taxes when they are already making these cuts everywhere else?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275062">It also says on that site that there is a drop in funding for community economic development programs which are the core funding mechanisms for FedNor initiatives. Also, 20 people are going to lose their jobs. Why are the Conservatives raising taxes when they are cutting? This is just one example of a program that is being cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275063">We have heard the Conservatives talking today and saying that they are not raising taxes, they are just making things more expensive for Canadians to buy. We have all heard the rhetoric from the government the last two and a half years, about that sort of thing. They call them taxes, so I do not know why they will not be honest with Canadians and tell them that these are in fact taxes when they raise the prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275064">There is one thing that has not been talked about today, and I have been listening intently. For those of us who have a number of border communities, I have three border crossings in my riding, out-shopping is a big problem, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses in the riding. If these things become more expensive, and I am going to talk about “these things” in a minute, that will simply promote crossing the border to shop. It is counterintuitive to raise these taxes, particularly on the things that I am going to talk about. I will use one example, bicycles. We import about $125 million in bicycles every year from 72 different countries. Now the tariff will increase from 7.5% to 13%. It will cost Canadian cyclists between $5 million and $6 million a year. That is what the tariff or tax on bicycles is going to cost Canadian consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275065">For the second reason, I am going to counterpoint what I have just said. As I talk about the examples in this budget, I am going to counterpoint with actual examples of really inappropriate spending by the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3275066">I just need to take one area, and I am going to talk about the G8 legacy fund. The G8 legacy fund was $1.2 billion all together, and a significant portion of that was used by the <Affiliation DbId="170841" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>, the minister for the Treasury Board, to spend some money in his riding. I will talk about some of that spending right now, and then you, Mr. Speaker, can tell me whether this was really appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275067">Let us begin with the famous gazebo. With some sidewalk upgrades, some landscaping and the gazebo, that came in at $745,000. By the way, if people watching or MPs would like to go and see this, it is at 15 Humphrey Drive in the township of Seguin. It is there, and people can see what $745,000 bought them. The point I am making is that if one does not cut and one spends money appropriately, one does not need to raise taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275068">Let us take another one, baby carriages. Nearly 90% of all baby carriages come from these countries with tariffs, so there would be a 3% tariff hike. That is a tax, and that 3% hike would cost Canadian consumers about $1 million annually. However, the <Affiliation DbId="170841" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> of course thought it was okay to pay for some signage in Muskoka Lakes and some sidewalks, decorative street lights, benches, waste receptacles and flower pots to a tune of $1,060,000. I am not sure that was really G8 legacy fund money. That money could have certainly counterbalanced the money the Conservatives need to bring in now by raising taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275069">Turning to school supplies, 61% of imported plastic school supplies are from these nations that now have new tariffs on them. There was a tariff before of 3% and now it is 6.5%. So these school supplies are now going to cost Canadian consumers $1.3 million a year. That is counterbalanced of course with some street lighting upgrades and new outdoor furniture for the town of Gravenhurst during the G8 legacy fund spending. That was $1,200,000. Is that appropriate spending?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275070">Some other costs to consumers include wigs. Let us say that for perhaps medical reasons, people may need to buy wigs. Those wigs would now cost Canadian consumers $4.6 million more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275071">Plastic tableware and houseware—I guess plastic spoons and forks—would have a tariff or tax on them that would cost $11 million. However, the taxes would be raised because in the township of Burk's Falls there were some sidewalks and one electronic sign and public washrooms that cost $150,000. The town of Parry Sound got new sidewalks and trees, a welcome sign and some landscaping and a fountain too, at a cost of $1,321,750. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275072">These figures I am giving members were not easy to find. It took us a long time to find these figures, and I am passing them on to everyone in this House and everybody who is watching on television because if we spend taxpayers' money appropriately we do not need to raise taxes, as the Conservatives would in this budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275073">Let me talk about the iPod tax and that on MP3 players. The Canada Border Services Agency has written to at least one importer to indicate that the iPod touch 8GB would be subject to end-user verification in order to get a tariff exemption. Sony has said it is way more trouble than it is worth. So we would see those things increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275074">I will give the grand total of the spending on the G8 legacy fund. I itemized a couple of things, but the grand total is $45,758,945, money spent inappropriately. This is one of the reasons that the government has to raise taxes, to make up for the shortfall.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275081">Mr. Speaker, it is a question of convenience for the Conservatives. If we raise tariffs in the country, it will cost Canadians more for those goods, and as far as I am concerned, that is a tax. It is a tax when the goods come across the border. It is an increase in price. We are talking about millions and millions of dollars, particularly right to the end of 2018. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275082">There really is no difference. Taxes increase the costs to consumers. Tariffs increase the cost to consumers. In fact, if we look at it that way, the tariff would increase the cost of that piano I was just talking about, and then there would be even more tax on that piano because the price of that piano would be even higher. Canadians get hit all the way around with this big increase, in this budget.</ParaText>

That is what we should be working toward. However, what is happening now with the budget, and with what the Conservatives have been doing since 2006, is that they have made that gap wider, meaning poorer families in my riding, just as in the member's riding and right across Canada, are the ones who suffer when the governments increase tariffs and taxes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275111">What we are looking at in this budget are taxes, which is what they are, on a huge number of goods. They have been listed over and over again by a number of my colleagues, so I will not go through every one of them. Basically, what we are looking at is absolutely astounding because we are not talking about pennies or hundreds or thousands of dollars. We are talking about taxes to the tune of billions of dollars, $7.8 billion over the next five years. That is what Canadians are going to be experiencing in the way of tax increases. To me, nobody, not even my colleagues across the way, can argue that they are not tax increases, whatever name they want to give them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275112">That again raises the question of credibility. When we look at the budget, the process of modernizing Canada's general preferential tariff regime for developing countries is being done at the same time as the Conservatives keep saying there are no tax increases. However, going back to the dictionary definition, these are taxes. There is no other way to look at them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275113">Looking at the detailed examples, bicycles have been explained enough times, but let us look at baby carriages. Ninety per cent of baby carriages are made overseas. This is going to hit low-income and middle-class people the hardest because when people have babies, they need baby carriages, and these taxes are very regressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275114">Let us look at school supplies. Single parents and low-income families are already telling me they are stretched to the limit in having to pay additional school fees and picking up the cost of supplies. What we are looking at are huge increases, from 3% to 6.5%. We are looking at almost double the taxation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275115">Another cost that absolutely has touched my heart is the tax on wigs. Those who suffer from alopecia cannot get wigs covered. They definitely cannot get them covered in my province of British Columbia. Now we have a tax on wigs. It breaks my heart to see that. I have a granddaughter who suffers from alopecia. I know the pain and agony that families go through and this is definitely an additional burden on families. When one thinks about it, it is very mean-spirited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275116">Let us put out there that my friends across the aisle do not understand tariffs being duties or taxes. How do they justify taxing credit unions? They have taken away funding from credit unions, which means it is going to cost credit unions more at the very time they are giving huge tax breaks to their big bank friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275117">Let me talk about the last one, which is paid parking. What does this have to do with tariffs on imported goods? This is about people going to see their loved ones in the hospital. It was bad enough there were parking costs, but now there are going to be taxes collected on it. This is a tax on the sick and their families and it is unacceptable. As for credibility, I look across the aisle and say, “Look in the mirror”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275136">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to join in the chorus of condemnation of the Conservative government's attempt to hide a $330 million tax hike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275137">It is a bit weird, however, that we have the NDP, which is traditionally protectionist, pushing for lower tariffs and we have the Conservatives, who are traditionally non-protectionist, pushing for higher tariffs. We Liberals are the only consistent ones because we traditionally push for lower tariffs, which is what in fact we are doing today.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3275138">In general, if you meet someone and ask him whether he thinks tariffs are a good thing and he says yes, you are probably talking to a New Democrat. If he says no, you are probably talking to a Conservative or a Liberal.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3275139">Therefore, the NDP seems to find itself in a situation of some confusion, relative to its normal state of mind. Nevertheless, we agree with the NDP fully on this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275140">The decision by the Conservative government represents a massive broken promise and will have negative implications for middle-class Canadian families, Canadian retailers and even some of the world's poorest countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275141">I was surprised to read about these tariff increases in budget 2013, as I clearly remember reading in the Conservatives' 2011 platform, in bold text no less, that they would “not raise taxes on Canadian consumers”. That is exactly what they have done here, a massive $330 million tax on consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275142">With all due respect to the sanctity of the House, I would make the general proposition that from a normal or intellectual point of view, this debate is totally ridiculous because everybody knows, as stated by our new Liberal leader in question period, the dictionary definition of a tariff is a tax on imports. Everybody knows the Conservatives have raised tariffs by $300 million, so they have raised taxes. That is clear and it is logical. I do not see any argument against it. If a tariff is a tax on imports, if imports go up $330 million, that is a tax hike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275143">Now it is true the Conservatives cut some tariffs, but by a much smaller amount. Therefore, net tariff revenue has gone up, ergo, a tax increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275144">This ridiculous argument that if it is the tariffs on China and India that go up, then it is not an tariff increase is stupid. A tariff is a tariff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275145">The market does not care whether it is a justified tariff or an unjustified tariff. If the tariff goes up, the cost of the good and the price of the good goes up and it is a tax. It does not matter whether members will argue that China and India no longer deserve these low tariffs. It still is the case that if those tariffs go up, prices go up, and that is a tax hike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275146">Mr. Speaker, I hope you will not mind if I mention a bit late that I would like to share half of my with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275147">That is the first case. This tariff hike is a tax hike. Any normal person would agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275148">A second example is these EI premium tax hikes that the Conservatives keep doing. They have had three increases in EI, coming to nearly $2 billion per year. Is that not a tax hike? If it is, how dare they say in the budget that they will not have any tax hikes. It is a tax hike. An employment insurance premium is a direct tax on jobs. Any increase in EI premiums is a tax hike, not just any old tax, but a tax on jobs, to the tune of close to $2 billion a year. That is the second case where they were wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275149">I suppose the Conservatives could muddle around and say the word “tax” is not there. It is employment insurance premium, so we will not call it a tax hike. That is just fiddling with words. EI premium is a tax, it is a tax on jobs and it has to be counted as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275150">However, if they can pretend that a tariff increase is not a tax hike or an EI premium increase is not a tax hike, they certainly cannot pretend that an increase in the income tax rate is not a tax hike.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3275151">That is what the Conservatives did in 2006. They increased the income tax rate by half of a percentage point. This was published by CRA. It was a done deal. They tried to claim that they were lowering the tax rate by a half point.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3275152">What I am trying to say is that the Conservatives have increased taxes at least three times, whether we are talking about income tax or taxes related to employment insurance benefits or tariffs. Each time they denied what was obvious, but in each instance they increased taxes.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3275153">Why do the Conservatives play this game, which from an intellectual point of view appears to be ridiculous and evidently wrong? I think the only reason is that when we add the political element, they think they can get away with it. We all know that what they are saying is wrong. However, when they say repeatedly, again and again, that they are not raising taxes, even though it is evident that they are, the Conservatives hope that the public will not notice and that they can carry this message, even though it is untruthful, through to the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275154"> That is why we have motions like this today. It is to try to get the information out to the public that the Conservatives are doing what we all know they are doing, which is raising taxes. That is why, among other reasons, the Liberal Party is pleased to support this NDP motion in an attempt to help educate the public as to what the government is in fact doing, as opposed to what it says it is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275155">These taxes make it extremely hard for middle-class Canadian families to make ends meet. This is a tax directly on the items Canadians need to make their households run properly. It is a tax on bicycles, blankets, wigs, coffee makers, paint brushes, kitchen knives and iPods. Yes, the dreaded iPod tax is here, thanks to the Conservative government. This is the best part: the only way to avoid the iPod tax is to join the iPod registry. Does that sound like the gun registry? My goodness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275156">Some of these tax increases demonstrate a heartless disregard for Canadians. I have mentioned the tax on wigs. What group makes the greatest use of wigs? It is actually Canadians undergoing chemotherapy. I cannot believe that the Conservative government would willingly attack Canadian cancer patients like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275157"> What we are seeing is the end product of a hastily made policy done on the back of an envelope to meet an artificial deficit reduction deadline. In its 2011 platform, the government set an unrealistic deadline to eliminate the deficit. Now the Conservatives are scrambling to make it happen by doing calculations on the backs of envelopes and raising taxes on middle-class families when they said that they would not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275158">The government should understand that the Canadian tariff regime is a complex machine with many moving parts. To do something at the snap of a finger on the back of an envelope will obviously have unintended consequences, such as the example of chemotherapy. I do not think that the Conservatives deliberately set out to attack people on chemotherapy, but they did not think things through. That is one of the unintended consequences of this very bad legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275159">I will end with one last point. I am not sure if this is an intended or unintended consequence. There are negative effects on the least developed, poorest countries in the world. When those countries import inputs for the manufacture of clothing, for example, from countries that are now seeing higher tariffs, such as India and China, Canada, when it imports things from these least developed countries, will have to impose higher tariffs, which will impose a burden not only on Canadian consumers but also on the residents of these least developed countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275160">In conclusion, from the point of view of government honesty, to deny that it is raising taxes is a travesty. Indeed, these measures have negative effects for Canadian consumers, for people living close to the border and for some of the poorest countries in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275161">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments on the Conservatives' efforts to raise taxes that are really going to hurt the average Canadian family. We have heard about taxes on school supplies, bicycles, shoes, iPads, iPods and hospital parking. I want to talk about the latter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275162">A few years ago, we had a family member who had a sudden illness and was in the hospital for about six weeks. Every family hopes to avoid something like that, but sometimes family members are in hospital for weeks or sometimes months. I know we were at the hospital every single day, and boy, the parking adds up. For an average family, paying that every single day as an unexpected charge can really hit a family hard at a time when they are already down with a family illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275163">Could the hon. member comment on why the Conservative government would possibly hit Canadians while they are trying to deal with a family emergency like a major illness?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3275164">Mr. Speaker, the short answer is because they are Conservatives. The longer answer is that I said earlier that I did not accuse them of deliberately going after people taking chemotherapy. I do not think Conservatives would that, nor would any other party in the House, but I think they knew what they were doing in imposing higher parking charges on people visiting loved ones in hospitals over an extended period of time, and I agree with the hon. member that it is not an appropriate action for people in such conditions. Savings should be found in other ways that do not bear down in such an unfair and strong manner on a select group of vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275165">Mr. Speaker, first I would like to ask the hon. member a question on preferential tariffs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275166">Preferential tariffs were given in 1974, the last time the program was reviewed, specifically to aid developing countries. I mentioned Brazil, Russia, India and China. It is in many of these countries that we see the most economic growth. When would the member support this policy being reviewed, if not now? Again, these tariffs have been around longer than I have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275167">Second, my understanding is that the Liberal Party has traditionally stood for free trade. If we do not have tariffs at some of these levels for some of these countries, there is no incentive for them to bargain and come to the table and enter into free trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275168">Finally, this government has reduced tariffs by over $590 million, particularly around manufacturing equipment, because we see manufacturers producing right here in Canada. I would ask the member to please look at supporting those kinds of measures, because they are going to keep our economy growing.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3275169">Mr. Speaker, in this budget the tariff increases are $330 million a year and the tariff decreases are $76 million a year. I would remind the hon. member that 333 is bigger than 76, so it is a net increase in tariff revenue, which means a net increase in tax. The member's government said it would not have any increases in tax, and that is my basic point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275170">In terms of the member's other point, an increase in the tariff on goods from China, India or Brazil is an increase in the tariff as much as an increase on any other country in the world. It is equally a tax increase and would equally disadvantage Canadian consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275171">If the government thinks that low tariffs on China are a bad thing but does not want to hit Canadian consumers, it should raise the tariff on China and reduce the tariff on other countries so as to neutralize the negative effect on Canadian households. The Conservatives have deliberately created a strong negative effect on Canadian middle-class households. It is a tax hike, and that is wrong.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3275172">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity that the member provided by agreeing to share his time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275173">It was just last week that a poll came out indicating that Canadians believe the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is actually quite secretive and has failed to govern with high ethical standards. One only needs to reflect on some of the things that have been said today from the government benches to get a better understanding of why so many Canadians from coast to coast to coast have this feeling that they just cannot trust the Conservatives, that there is a hidden message out there, and that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not being straightforward with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275174">There is some irony there. The Leader of the Liberal Party gave a specific quote. He quoted a dictionary, the <I>Collins English Dictionary</I>. He stated that the dictionary said a tariff is “a tax levied by a government on imports”. It is a tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275175">If Canadians are asked what a tariff is at a breakfast nook or a Tim Hortons, or wherever it might be, or what it is when the government increases a charge on a product coming into Canada, chances are they will appreciate that it is in fact a tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275176"> The government needs to concede that it is in fact bringing in tax increases, yet it is spending huge amounts of tax dollars—millions—on advertising its so-called action plan, which many, including myself, would argue is a dud. The government will spend millions of public dollars, tax dollars, telling Canadians that it is not increasing taxes, when in fact the government is increasing taxes and using tax dollars to try to convince Canadians that it is not increasing tax dollars. There is some irony in that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275177">We in the Liberal caucus recognize that a tax increase is a tax increase, and that is what this tariff is all about. It is going to generate in excess of a quarter of a billion dollars. The number of $330-plus million is being used. We know for a fact that we are talking about at least a quarter of a billion dollars. That is a great deal of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275178">Where is that money coming from? Who is going to be footing that bill? Who is going to be providing that additional revenue? It is going to be the middle class. It is going to be those individuals who aspire to be a part of the middle class. Those are the individuals who are going to have to pay for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275179">We hear a lot about the iPods, and for good reason. At the end of the day, when we go back to the core of the question that the leader of the Liberal Party put to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> today, what we are talking about includes tricycles, school supplies, and those little red wagons that quite often a child aspires to get, whether it is from the Canadian Tire department store or from the many other retail outlets across our land. These are relatively young parents who are trying to get the financial means to provide for their children in a productive fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275180">Many would argue that the middle class is a very important group of people, and the government is ignoring that group. It is ignoring this group because it believes it can take them for granted. On the one hand the government says it is not increasing taxes, but on the other hand it is using tariffs to garner $300 million plus, and that is going to have an impact on the middle class. There is going to be a tax increase through this budget 2013.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3275181">There has always been a price gap. I have raised this today in the form of questions to both government and New Democrats in regard to recognizing the importance of the price gap between the United States and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275182">Our population in good part lives along that border. With regard to consumers and retailers, I can speak from Manitoba's perspective, but I believe retailers across this land recognize that one of the greatest frustrations they have is justifying to consumers in Canada why our prices are a little higher than those of the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275183">In good part, the new tax the government will implement this year will increase the price gap between Canada and the United States. We have independent economists who have acknowledged that will happen, that we will see a larger price gap. We have met with many different small business people throughout this country who are concerned about the price gap. The government has turned a deaf ear to one of the most important economic engines in our country today, which is small business. Small businesses are concerned about the price gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275184">The government has done very little to address this very important issue. I would pose the question, and I am surprised that the government has not provided impact studies that have been done so that we would know first-hand the degree to which these tax increases will impact Canadians, both for consumers and for the potential jobs that could be lost because of the increase in the price gap. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275185">I suspect, as in the past on many of the economic measures taken by the government, that it has not done its homework. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170090" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> indicated that he does not necessarily believe that the Conservative government saw the impact of the increased tariff on wigs. We would like to think not. However, the government has now been made aware that the greatest consumers for wigs today are individuals who are receiving chemotherapy or cancer treatment. There are a good number of reasons why individuals require wigs. How will the government respond, now that the issue has been brought to its attention? We will have to wait and see. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275186">It bears repeating that the government has a responsibility to be more transparent and accountable for the actions it is taking. There are tax increases in the budget. The middle class and our consumers from coast to coast to coast will have to pay more because of these tax increases that are being imposed upon them. Some Canadians will be affected more than others because of their need for many of the products on which the tariffs are being applied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275187">I heard the other day the spending on the promotion of the economic action plan, the one I referred to as the dud, will be literally in the millions of dollars this year, to tell Canadians that we are not having tax increases, which is just not true. There are significant tax increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275188">I challenge members of the Conservative government to stand in their place and acknowledge the reality that the PMO follows the debates in the chamber, and if individuals mention the economic action plan in a positive way, they get a gold star. If they say there is a tax increase in our budget, they are in a lot of trouble from the PMO.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275214">In the last election, the Conservatives made a commitment not to increase the tax burden on Canadians. In the weeks prior to the tabling of budget 2013, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> reaffirmed this commitment, promising Canadians that no new tax increases would be announced in the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275215">The truth is that Canadian consumers will pay roughly $8 billion more over the next five years. Budget 2013 is full of new tax increases on virtually everything, from hospital parking to credit unions and labour-sponsored investment funds. The most significant increases come from a change to import duties. The tariff hikes will increase the prices of some 1,290 types of products. As a result, Canadian consumers will have to pay more for a whole range of products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275216">According to the Retail Council of Canada, the changes in the classification of emerging countries for customs tariffs will increase the prices of some products by up to 18% and will far outweigh any lower prices that Canadians may pay because of the elimination of taxes on sporting goods and baby items.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275217">Eliminating customs fees on children's clothing and sports equipment will deprive the government of $76 million. This was supposed to be a savings for Canadians, but it is not. Through this increase on products imported from these 72 countries, the government will receive $333 million a year. As such, the Conservative government has chosen to tax Canadian families to the tune of $257 million and that is just in this year's budget. It is therefore not $76 million in savings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275218">To name a few examples, tariffs on bicycles, strollers, coffee makers, school supplies and even iPods will go up. By increasing tariffs on over 80% of every type of import from more than 70 countries, the government is taking money directly out of Canadian consumers' wallets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275219">Sony Canada has warned consumers that they can expect an increase of 5% to 6% in the cost of MP3 players and iPods. This new 5% tax on iPods clearly illustrates the Conservatives' hypocrisy when it comes to tax increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275220">This is what the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="170352" Type="2">Parry Sound—Muskoka</Affiliation> said on December 14, 2010: “During this fragile economic recovery, the last thing Canadian families and consumers need is a massive new tax on iPods.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275221">It seems that the Conservatives changed their minds again, that they are bad managers or compulsive liars. It is very hard to tell which, but there is no doubt that the iPod tariff will go up. In the end, Canadians will have to pay more for MP3 players and many other consumer products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275222">For a government that has been saying for years how important it is to simplify the tax code, these changes are beyond comprehension and illustrate that the Conservatives are making things up as they go along. What the Conservatives are saying to consumers is that if a child has the opportunity to play hockey, then his parents might get to save some money. However, if his parents buy him a bicycle, then they are out of luck and they will have to pay more. It is illogical and outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275223">Douglas Porter, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal and an expert on price disparity between Canada and the United States, indicated that these changes could further increase the price differences between the two countries. This situation could further damage Canadian businesses, which will find it even more difficult to compete with their American counterparts. Meanwhile, this cross-border price gap continues to widen. The government should be supporting Canadian retailers instead of giving consumers yet another reason to buy abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275224">A study conducted by the Bank of Montreal last year found that retail prices in Canada are still approximately 14% higher than those in the United States. Instead of giving Canadian families a break, the government is piling it on and increasing tariffs.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3275248">Mr. Speaker, last December I and my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170215" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation>, put a number of questions to the <Affiliation DbId="147115" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation>. Those questions had to do with the need for a more transparent and more accountable regime for government procurement. Both my colleague and I have been receiving successive calls from business sectors across this country about the way procurement is now being governed by the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275249">By way of example, last December we had raised the matter of the contract with SNC-Lavalin to manage 323 federal buildings for almost half a billion dollars a year. The contract allowed for significant subcontracting, and that appears to be the case on most occasions in contracting with this federal government. Increasingly, there are centralized one-person-only or one-corporation contracts and considerable subcontracting. That raises a lot of issues, which I will go into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275250">It had been revealed that a number of the subcontractors under the SNC-Lavalin contract had billed the government for outrageously overpriced costs, yet even though this is public money, we are advised that the subcontracts are considered private. This policy opens the door to potential abuse, as was discovered when the government finally contracted an audit: it found this abuse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275251">We called on the <Affiliation DbId="147115" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation> to conduct an audit to ensure that taxpayers are getting their money's worth in terms of both building management and the awarding of subcontracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275252"> The minister's response was that contractual obligations were limited to the general contractor. She also limited her duty, apparently, to ensuring the lowest bid from the general contractor, but there was no obligation to ensure the same to be the case with the subcontractors, the presumption being that ensured savings would flow to the taxpayer if they simply took the lowest bid as the primary factor in issuing contracts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275253">There was no mention of any need to ensure lowest bid for the many subcontractors, yet an audit contracted by the <Affiliation DbId="147115" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation> in 2011 reported numerous absurdly overpriced billings, including $1,000 to install a doorbell and $2,000 for two plants. The minister advised that all the recommendations by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the audit company, have been implemented, including increased oversight and monitoring of this contract, and ordered in late 2010 a reprocurement of the contract. Of note, the contract was again issued to SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275254">Parties seeking subcontracts under the SNC-Lavalin half-billion-dollar per year federal building contract have continued to raise concerns. They relate to fairness, transparency and efficacy in the bidding process. The minister provided reassurances that the integrity of this contract is governed by a new integrity framework. She offered a briefing to me on the new, improved system. I am looking forward to finally receiving this briefing at the end of May.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275255">In the interim, I have unfortunately continued to receive pleas from numerous Canadian business sectors, ranging from companies providing and servicing shredders to the government to companies relocating RCMP, military and federal workers. All of these companies have complained about the new one-size-fits-all contracting process. All have raised concerns about the centralization of contracts and reduced opportunities for local suppliers. All complain of the lack of transparency. All are concerned that there is no longer genuine consultation, and they are concerned about the RFPs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275257">As part of enhancing the integrity of the real property and procurement process, Public Works and Government Services Canada is constantly reviewing and strengthening its measures to improve integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275258">In 2007, as part of the Federal Accountability Act and the federal accountability action plan, Public Works and Government Services Canada added a code of conduct for procurement to its RFP documents as well as measures to render suppliers ineligible to bid on procurement contracts if they have been convicted of fraud or if they have paid a contingency fee to a person to whom the Lobbying Act applies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275259">In 2010, Public Works and Government Services Canada added an offence to its list of measures regarding integrity, thereby rendering suppliers ineligible to bid on procurement contracts if they have been convicted of corruption, collusion, bid-rigging or any other anti-competitive activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275260">In July 2012, Public Works and Government Services Canada implemented additional measures to strengthen the integrity of its real property and procurement operations. As a result of these measures, the department is strengthening due diligence, reducing the risk of fraud and improving its ability to manage risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275261">Allow me to summarize. We have already put in place provisions allowing us to render ineligible bidders found guilty of one of the following offences: fraud against the government under the Criminal Code of Canada; fraud under the Financial Administration Act; corruption, collusion, bid-rigging or any other anti-competitive activity under the Competition Act; and the payment of contingency fees to a person to whom the Lobbying Act applies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275262">On July 11, 2012, Public Works and Government Services Canada extended the application of integrity provisions to its real property transactions, such as leasing contracts, and added six additional offences that would render suppliers ineligible to do business with departments: money laundering, participation in the activities of criminal organizations, income and excise tax evasion, bribing a foreign public official and drug trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275263">These measures went into effect when announced and apply to all future PWGSC solicitations and real property transactions, which include leasing agreements, letting of space and acquisition and disposal of Crown-owned assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275264">These measures will also allow the department to terminate contracts and leases with companies or individuals that are convicted before the end of their contract or lease.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275266">For example, in the case of the relocation contract, it used to be the case where major contractors sat down with Public Works and Government Services, talked about what the needs were and then would go off and prepare their bids. Now it is divide and conquer. One comes in at a time and there is no genuine consultation. There is deep concern that the subcontractors who relocate people from small communities are going to miss out because of the way they are moving in the bidding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275267">I am wondering if the member could advise what new measures are in place to watchdog the subcontractors also, because that appears to have been the major problem determined by the auditors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275272">In December of last year I asked the <Affiliation DbId="184400" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> why the government had cut funding to the Centre for Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility, one of the pillars of the government’s Corporate Social Responsibility strategy launched in 2009. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275273">The response from the minister at the time was that Canadians can be proud of the results that their tax dollars are achieving abroad. What is funny is that the minister made no reference to the Centre for Excellence in his response. The term “corporate social responsibility” seems to have been banished from the Conservatives' vocabulary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275274">Since I asked this question, we have learned that five civil society organizations—Amnesty International, KAIROS, Mennonite Central Committee Canada, MiningWatch and the United Steelworkers—have left the centre’s executive committee due to the government’s refusal to fund the centre. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3275275">The Centre for Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility brought together mining companies, Canadian civil society groups and government representatives from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, Natural Resources Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency. Frankly, it was the only working element of Canada's CSR policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275276">The government has given no explanation for ending its support of the centre. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275277">A multi-stakeholder approach is essential for dealing with the challenges inherent in developing a CSR policy. We need constructive engagement. We must encourage civil society to sit down with government and mining companies to develop a better policy based on international standards of transparency and accountability. We need all the actors at the table to advocate for responsible management of natural resources that would enable countries to derive and sustain social and economic benefits from their natural resources.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275278">Just after announcing the end of funding for the centre, the government announced new funding to the tune of $25 million dollars over five years for the creation of a Canadian International Institute for Extractive Industries and Development. The money is clearly there. It is just that this government does not seem to want constructive engagement and a multi-stakeholder approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275279">The fact is, this situation is a travesty. The Canadian brand is suffering abroad. Canadian companies are facing lawsuits and challenges in the area of human rights and environmental impacts. A transparent process that stakeholders and the public find to be credible would help improve Canada's image and would also help businesses that comply with the strictest standards.</ParaText>

We should facilitate this through a stronger CSR strategy, not by cutting one of the only good tools we have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275281">With this in mind, I ask the government why it has turned away from any semblance of a commitment to a strong CSR strategy. Will it reverse its decision to cut funding to the Centre for Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility and admit that it was a very bad decision?</ParaText>

It is our duty to explore all partnerships and all innovative ideas to meet this critical objective.

Trends show that this will only increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275291">Canadians know that a responsibly managed extractive sector can be a force for positive change. This translates into jobs, social services, and improved livelihoods so people can lift themselves out of poverty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275302">Mr. Speaker, the Conservative cuts to the interim federal health program have left vulnerable newcomers in a very precarious and difficult position in Canada. The interim federal health program provided crucial temporary health benefits to refugees and asylum seekers until they became eligible for provincial health coverage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275303">The Conservative cuts deny access to health care for large numbers of refugees and claimants, threatening the health of refugees, many of whom face health concerns due to the fact that they have left everything they own to flee from situations of persecution, violence and torture in their home countries. These punitive and mean-spirited Conservative cuts categorize refugees into different groups, each of which receive different health care coverage. Refugees from so-called safe countries, a list that is created at the discretion of the minister, are cut off from even basic medical coverage, completely turning a blind eye to the refugees' individual experience and need for medical care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275304">Along with the New Democratic Party, medical experts, front-line health care workers and refugee support workers across the country have condemned these cuts, stating that they are unfair, unethical and inhumane. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275305">Not only have the changes hurt some of the most vulnerable, but costs are being downloaded to the provinces and communities across the country. I raised this issue the previous time because these short-sighted cuts were actually impacting a volunteer-run clinic in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170390" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>. The volunteer clinics, offered by the Muslim Welfare Centre, provide services to all in the community. They are feeling significantly overwhelmed because of the changes to the interim federal health program and because of these cuts. It does not make sense to me that the government believes that volunteer-run community clinics should pay for this misguided decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275306">Experts also state that these cuts will only end up costing Canadians more, as untreated conditions will lead to more expensive hospital care further down the road. Since these cuts have been implemented, we have all heard horrible stories of refugees denied proper health care, cancer patients whose treatments have been cut off, children with asthma unable to receive their medication and forced to wait until their next attack and be hospitalized. Refugees who are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder have had their medications cut off, and what about the stories that have not been made public yet?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275307">Since the Conservative cuts to the interim federal health program, refugees are suffering and the health of those seeking refuge in Canada has been jeopardized. Given that these Conservative cuts are demonstrably impacting refugees with legitimate health concerns, including vulnerable groups like children, pregnant women, cancer patients and the elderly, will the government reverse these mean-spirited cuts?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275308">Mr. Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170390" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> is quite aware of the interim federal health fund. If not, I am happy to speak to the changes made by a prior government, the reasons those changes were made and the purpose of the interim federal health plan that still exists for those who come to this country seeking asylum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275309">The interim health fund actually began in 1957 to prepare those coming to this country, from an immigration perspective, to ensure that there was some form of health care for them as they transitioned and began their lives here in Canada. In the early seventies, the program was expanded when we began to take on our responsibility as a country for those in this world who were seeking asylum. They were fleeing their countries of origin because they may have been facing persecution or at the very least were in danger and were looking for an alternative place to call home. Canada was one of those countries that stepped up to the plate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275310">To this day, Canada resettles one in every 10 refugees in this world. When we think about that in terms of our size, in terms of the advancement we have made to assist these individuals and families who come to our country truly seeking refuge and who deserve to be designated refugees, we are more than doing our part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275311">Our doors have always been open. They continue to be open to immigrants and to genuine refugees, but Canadians have no tolerance for those who abuse the system and our generosity. The member lumps all those together in this file as if they are one group of individuals or families. That is simple not the case. We need to distinguish between refugees, asylum claimants and failed asylum claimants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275312">We have a system in which true refugees still receive interim federal health. They still receive assistance. It is on par with that of Canadians who do not have any type of additional assistance for health care, such as, for example, my mother, who is in her early seventies. She does not receive extended benefits. She does not have an extended pension. All those who fall under this category as refugees are at the very least able to receive the same services my mother enjoys. I do not know that all Canadians would actually see that as wrong. I think they would see that as fair. I certainly see that as fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275313">When we look at those who have taken advantage of this system, those bogus asylum seekers who came to this country for no reason other than to take advantage of our social services and health care, they chose to go back to their countries of origin the day before they had the opportunity to stand in front of the Immigration and Refugee Board. They took somewhere up to a thousand days, in some cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3275314">We think Canada is a place for those who seek refuge and deserve it. They will receive interim federal health. I think my colleague understands that those individuals who are not truly refugees should not be taking advantage of the system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3275316">The parliamentary secretary reminded us that Canada resettles one in 10 refugees in the world. Now we are creating a two-tiered health care system among them. Once again, those who seek asylum in Canada are not bogus queue-jumpers, as we heard, once again, from the <Affiliation DbId="170853" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> and many members opposite. They are actually people who are seeking protection. Refugees are not coming to Canada to abuse our system. They are fleeing for their lives. This is why we have a refugee determination system in place. We need to ensure that it has the resources to make sound and timely decisions. In the meantime, refugee claimants and refugees may require temporary help. It is not fair for the government to say that all refugee claimants or asylum seekers are bogus claimants.</ParaText>
