          <ParaText id="3178078">The House resumed from February 4 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act (administration, air and railway transportation and arbitration)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170286" Type="2">Ms. Isabelle Morin (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178079">Mr. Speaker, I have mixed feelings about Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. This is difficult because I want to encourage our rail services and I support the bill. However, there are significant gaps not addressed by the legislation that absolutely need to be brought forward. In committee we will try to make some needed improvements to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178080">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> consulted several experts, including exporters, and many of them brought up the issue of price. Absent from Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is the important and unregulated discrepancy in rail fees, for example, between CP and CN. Why are existing discrepancies not addressed in the bill? Rail freight transportation must be more efficient and effective. It needs to provide reliable and sustainable services. Unregulated rail fees are another aspect to look into and this can be done at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178081">Trains move goods and people. Trains are a key mode of transportation for Canadians in the 21st century. I myself try to travel between my riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine and Ottawa by train as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178082">Rail freight transportation provides a service to our Canadian farmers and producers who ship their goods to market by train. This mode of transportation is essential to Canada's economic development, but does it currently benefit our farmers, producers and our Canadian shippers' associations as much as it benefits CN and CP? Does it benefit public transportation as much as it supports commercial interests?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178083">A look at balance sheets and recent decisions at CP and CN show that these companies are run for their shareholders, not for the users of public transportation or small family businesses that rely on rail freight transportation. This decision was a choice, a choice made to serve shareholders and profits over customers. We have seen this before and we know this leads to poor quality services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178084">The Coalition of Rail Shippers has been stating for years that it receives poor quality services from CN and CP because of this pricing issue, and they are priority clients. Listen to the private shippers. They tell us that CN dictates the market. CN is the largest player in Canadian rail freight transportation. According to a report by the Coalition of Rail Shippers presented at the Canadian maritime conference in 2010, “CN and CPR together control 94% of the market by revenue”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178085">This market lacks competition, innovation and regulation. This is not the way to support Canada's economy or to encourage Canadian success. It is important that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> gives freight shippers the right to enter into service agreements with railway companies and establish an arbitration process in the event of a dispute. This is what freight shippers told us they needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178086">Rail shipping is the backbone of the Canadian economy. Transport Canada estimates that over 70% of all goods shipped over land go by train. The reason is easy to understand. In our very big country, rail shipping is often in bulk and it would be difficult to ship these large quantities by truck. Shipping by boat, which is sometimes more economical, is not available everywhere for obvious reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178087">Canada was built by train and the railway is a vital link between faraway communities on a vast land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178088">I would like to talk about an activity that I did in my riding. I organized a screening of a movie called <I>Rocky Mountain Express</I>. Its filmmaker is based in my riding. About 100 of us watched this wonderful movie, which talks about the history of the train in Canada and how it built the west of Canada. It was amazing. It really showed us how our country was based on rail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178089">We might be surprised by the poor quality of rail shipping services in Canada right now. The Conservative government is not the only one responsible for this situation, but it is guilty of inaction on this file. Day in and day out the Conservative government claims to work for the Canadian economy, but Canadian businesses are suffering from this unreliable service, the result of which is hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses every year. This affects a broad range of industries, especially agriculture, forestry and mining.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178090">The rail freight service review found that 80% of rail shippers are dissatisfied with the services provided by rail carriers. This is 80% of loyal customers. Unreliable service and high prices continue to hurt rail customers. This issue is not addressed in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. We, the official opposition, will continue to push for fair pricing for all shippers, prices that are in line with the services received from carriers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178091">That is something we do not see in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, which says that agreements governed by the new law would be made only with new customers and new contracts. Therefore, anyone who has been using the services for years, and who is a long-standing loyal customer, would not have access to the rules that Bill C-52 seeks to put in place. Clearly, there is room for improvement. We could make these improvements in committee if the government would be open enough to come to the table and participate in meaningful discussions and listen to the best suggestions to get the best bill possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178092">I would like to come back to the fact that 80% of customers are dissatisfied. Something had to be done and something still urgently needs to be done, but the Conservatives' inaction has been going on for years. Why have the Conservatives taken so long to do something? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178093">Here is what I think may be happening. First, rail freight customers are often farmers or mining companies. These customers have to deal with large railways that have a virtual monopoly over rail transport. In most regions of the country, shippers cannot choose a rail transportation company because they have access to only one or the other. Even in cases where the two railway companies are present, the competition struggles to play the role it should and to influence the basic economic principle of supply and demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178094">Why do we need to intervene now and legislate? Why can the parties involved not come to an agreement themselves? In all likelihood, CN and CP benefit from the tacit support of the Conservative government and, in that context, they are not at all prepared to make real concessions. The result is that rail freight customers, the shippers, are not satisfied with rail freight services. Therefore, they have asked the government to take action and to introduce legislation that would require CN and CP to reach agreements on the level of service provided to shippers. After years of empty words, the Conservatives are now being forced to act as a result of pressure from the shipping community and the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178095">Under duress, the Conservatives finally introduced a bill designed to solve some of these problems after the NDP critic's bill was introduced last spring. That bill, which was entitled the rail customer protection act, was much clearer and covered all customers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178096">The government is using half measures and here are some examples. The protective measures do not cover existing contracts between shippers and rail transport companies. The bill offers only a limited arbitration process for unsuccessful negotiations of new contracts. The arbitration is available only for shippers who are negotiating new contracts, instead of providing fast and reliable help for all shippers. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would cover only new service level agreements, not those that already exist. Furthermore, the fines mentioned in Bill C-52 would go to the government and not to the shippers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178097">We could talk all day about the amount of these fines, which seem a bit weak to me for such big companies. The ability to interact, discuss and negotiate is undermined when the fines go into the government's pocket, which supports what I said earlier, that CN and CP probably feel as if the Conservative government is in their corner. The Conservatives simply do not give Canada's rail network the attention it deserves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178108">Canada's railways are essential to the forestry, mining and agriculture industries. This bill will help those sectors manage supply and demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178109">Canada is one of the only countries that has decided to put moving goods ahead of moving people. And we should continue to do so, because our country is so vast. There are some places we simply cannot get to by truck. In northern Ontario, for instance, sometimes the train is the only reliable mode of transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178110">This bill will improve things in that regard. It will give shippers that sign transportation contracts a more level playing field for negotiations with CN and CP, which together earn 94% of train revenues in Canada. </ParaText>

          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Rousseau" id="7879968">
            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170180" Type="2">Mr. Jean Rousseau (Compton—Stanstead, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178118">Mr. Speaker, in today's context of a free trade environment and a free and highly competitive global market—hardly anybody talks about globalization anymore these days, by the way—the key is to develop a healthy trade environment that is conducive to the development a modern, flexible, solid and reliable infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178119">Rail transportation in Canada represents a significant share of the economy. It contributes approximately 70%. In Quebec, the figure is slightly lower, and in the rest of Canada, slightly higher. This creates another problem too: more trucks on our roads are a threat to another infrastructure. Nevertheless, approximately 70% of all freight in Canada is shipped by rail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178120">It is consequently essential for these freight services to be profitable not only to the rail transport companies, but to shippers as well. The cost of rail freight services is a problem for Canadian shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178121">By failing to address some of the issues surrounding fees, the bill disregards the demands being made by some groups from the shipping community. As I mentioned in my preamble, in establishing a free, highly competitive market, the freight transport link in the chain is extremely important to the development of our economic strategy, and in particular for the prosperity of some regions in Canada and Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178122"> We are nevertheless going to support the bill at second reading today. The wording of the bill amends the Canada Transportation Act to require railway companies, when asked to do so by a shipper, to prepare an offer to enter into a contract that sets out the steps it must take to discharge its obligations to the shipper. It also establishes an admittedly rather rigorous process to set out the stipulations in such a contract if the shipper and the railway company are unable to reach agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178123"> That was the gist of the question I asked my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170286" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation> a short while ago, and it may not have been particularly clear. What I wanted to say was that when you end up in arbitration in a negotiation, it is because something has not functioned properly in the prior discussions. This leads to legal proceedings in which there is often a winner and a loser. It is of course difficult to find a formula for dealings between a SME shipper and a multinational that would make everyone a winner, and this will not change. It would also have been useful to look into other options through which negotiation between the parties may have been facilitated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178124"> The bill would also amend provisions concerning air transportation, with a view to rationalizing internal procedures, as well as a number of other provisions concerning the administration of the act, which are still, I might add, exceedingly complex. When the goal is to improve the situation and enhance a sector of the economy, it is important to make things easier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178125"> However, given that the short title of the bill is the “Fair Rail Freight Service Act”, I am skeptical about its purpose. The ambiguous wording implies possible loopholes, as I mentioned, particularly in view of this government sense of equity, which is to give more to the big fish and less to the small fry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178126"> Let us not forget that the Canada Transportation Act is an umbrella statute that governs a number of air and rail transportation markets, and that dates from 1996. Among other things, it bases the national transportation policy on establishing free competition between carriers and different modes of transportation. When a shipper in a remote part of Canada has to deal with a specific transportation company, that shipper has no choice but to find a way to negotiate a deal with Canadian National or Canadian Pacific.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178127"> An update was therefore both desirable and justified, because the players in this economic sector have been complaining for many years about chronic problems of service inefficiency and reliability from the rail network owners.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178128"> The fact is that 80% of clients and shippers say they are not satisfied with rail transport services in Canada. It is partly for that reason that they have asked the government to act, and introduce legislation requiring the main carriers, CN and CP, to reach agreements with shippers on the level and quality of services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178129"> In reality, shippers have difficulty in obtaining fair, reliable and punctual rail transport services. Some of them cannot even get contracts with the large rail carriers, and those that do have contracts experience significant delays more often than not, only to be told that they do not have enough cars available to ship their goods and meet demands for service at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178130"> The level of dissatisfaction is high enough to prompt important questions about respect for business on the part of the major carriers, and here I am once again talking obviously about Canadian Pacific and Canadian National. As I have said, freight transport is a vital link. In remote areas and in the regions, it is important for rail transport to operate as a means of support for a number of sectors of activity, such as agriculture and forestry. In times gone by, in a neighbouring riding in the Eastern Townships, the municipality of Richmond had a port that was one of the most important transshipment points for freight in Eastern Canada. When market forces were allowed to operate without hindrance, Richmond suffered greatly from a limited choice of carriers and inferior infrastructure—it has to be said—and there was a striking decrease in population and, inevitably, a rise in the unemployment rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178131"> Nor should we forget that in some remote points in our great country, and now I am talking about my part of Quebec, we are often dealing with small carriers as well as American transport firms that move freight through border areas, as is the case in my riding. Some stretches of railroad have even been sold to American companies, which ship freight by rail as far as the Canadian border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178132"> We therefore have to admit that we definitely need legislation to regulate and consolidate an economic sector that is not just important, but often vital in many rural regions of Canada. I am referring once again to remote regions. Since I became a member of this House, I have always defended the rural regions. It is those regions that give our country its identity. When they are vibrant and prosperous, they represent the very identity of Canada. I see no problem in letting market forces operate, but we must nevertheless help small companies, small carriers and small shippers, because they generate a large portion of the total freight volume in the regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178133"> The poor quality of rail transport services for freight thus costs the Canadian economy, particularly our many rural communities—as I have repeatedly said—that are already seriously threatened by the downturn in manufacturing and forestry, hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and hundreds of thousands of jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178134"> Many industries in Canada have to deal day after day with losses caused by deteriorating crops that have languished too long in poor conditions waiting for transport services, with work interruptions in plants and mines for lack of parts, or with shipments that are missing or lost somewhere in the transport network.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178135">Poor rail service hurts Canadian shippers who must meet the just-in-time standard. I do not know if my colleagues know what that means. It means that if I order it today, I want it yesterday. That is how it works in goods production and business in general. Poor service also hurts our global competitiveness and costs us hundreds of thousands of jobs. It can even cause corporations and SMEs to close their doors. It has also resulted in the rural exodus, which truly saddens me.<I/></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178156">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to join my colleagues in speaking to Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178157"> Because I represent a rural region, this issue is very important to me and my constituents. I thank my colleagues who spoke before me and who have done a good job of highlighting these very important aspects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178158"> If the bill is enacted as it now stands, it will require a railway company, on a shipper’s request, to make the shipper an offer to enter into a contract respecting the manner in which the railway company must fulfill its service obligations to the shipper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178159"> Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> also provides for the creation of an arbitration process to establish the terms of such a contract, if the railway company and the shipper are unable to agree on a fair and equitable agreement after lengthy negotiation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178160"> The bill comes in response to numerous pleas from shippers all over Canada and the hard work and unflagging efforts of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, whom I would also like to congratulate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178161"> After years of discussion, through both the panel of experts and consultations with stakeholders, and after my colleague’s bill was introduced last year, the Conservatives realized they had a duty to present this bill, at last. It is an attempt to respond to the complaints from rail shipping services customers who are being offered poor service by the biggest companies, which have a virtual monopoly over the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178162"> It is really high time that this government examined the problems in this situation, because the difficulties experienced by shippers everywhere in Canada are quite real and have a direct impact on the economy, particularly in rural regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178163"> In Canada, as several of my colleagues have said already, over 70% of freight is shipped by rail. However, a study of rail shipping services shows that 80% of shippers are dissatisfied with the services they receive. This is probably because 80% of the commitments the big companies made to them were not honoured. Clearly there is a problem and it is time for the government to take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178164"> Here we have the rough outline of a bill; there is still much to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178165"> At present, the situation is hard on the shippers. Rail freight customers have trouble obtaining fair and reliable service. Some customers cannot even obtain contracts with a major railway. Some with contracts have other difficulties, such as serious delays, the insufficient number of railcars available to transport all the goods their industry requires, or the countless interruptions in service that decrease their profits and may eventually result in lost jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178166"> The fact that shippers often do not have a choice of carrier is also a serious problem. They have access to CN or CP, but not always to both. Those who have a choice between the two companies still have to pay too much, especially small businesses in rural ridings. Such small businesses often are just getting by and then have to pay these fees. That makes it very hard for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178167"> The situation I have described affects many sectors of the economy, including natural resources, agriculture and forestry. To a large extent, these industries produce goods for export, but they are at a great disadvantage because of the poor quality of the rail services they depend on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178168"> The cost of services, the major gaps in the rail network and the way the system operates are all detrimental to Canada's overall competitive position on the world's markets, in addition to causing job losses and costing our economy hundreds of millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178169"> The most seriously affected industries are found mainly in the rural areas of the Canadian west, and in British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario. It is a widespread problem and will affect thousands of people across the country. They need the government to act quickly and they need legislation that goes further than Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> does currently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178170"> I think of my riding, Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, where a number of large businesses employ thousands of people all over the area. Although they are located far from the major urban centres, they are served by rail lines—for freight, at least.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178171"> I think of the many small and medium-sized businesses all across my riding, and some large firms as well, such as Alcoa in Deschambault-Grondines, Ciment Québec in Saint-Basile or Graymont in Saint-Marc-des-Carrières.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178172"> At one time, the Bowater plant in Donnacona was served by a rail freight line. Now, unfortunately, the business has shut down. It has declared bankruptcy and limited the former workers' access to pensions. That is another matter we can debate at another time, I hope. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178173"> As I said, these businesses represent a large part of my riding's economic activity. They need good-quality, reliable rail services in order to plan their freight shipments, to be efficient, to grow and to contribute to economic growth and development in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178174"> I also think about the farmers who depend on railways to ship their produce all across the country. I think about the forestry industry. which has been such an important part of the economy throughout the region, particularly in Saint-Raymond de Portneuf, Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval, Lac Beauport and Stoneham-et-Tewkesbury. This industry has been neglected by the government and, on top of that, suffers from the problems affecting the railway network.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178175"> As I mentioned, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is a step in the right direction. It has some good elements in it. This is why I will be supporting it at second reading, so it will be sent to committee where it can be considered and improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178176"> Among other things, some consideration must be given to the safeguards that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> sets out. These safeguards will not cover existing contracts between shippers and railways, which will leave many clients with no recourse. A few shippers will be able to benefit from certain safeguards when they negotiate their new contracts, but all the others that have already signed contracts with the big companies will have to endure the unfair treatment that already exists. They will have very few options, just the very limited ones available now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178177"> In addition, the arbitration process set out in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> must also be given further consideration. The process is very limited and is likely to be prohibitively expensive for the shippers. They will not necessarily be able to go all the way to the end of the process and defend themselves against big corporations, which often have many more resources. This aspect of the bill must therefore be re-examined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178178"> Another troubling element is the fact that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> totally ignores the issue of the high rates that shippers are charged by transportation companies. This has been one of the most important demands by shippers for years now. As I mentioned, they have to deal with a virtual monopoly, and sometimes even with a real monopoly because they have no options, aside from one of the two main railway companies in their area. Small shippers and small companies that need railway services have practically no bargaining power. They have to accept the rates they are charged without being able to fight back against the railways. This issue has been ignored by this government for many years now. It is still ignored in the bill that is before us today at second reading. I hope the Conservatives will support the amendments that the NDP will be putting forward, because it is high time that action was taken. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178179"> Canada’s trade deficit is increasing. If I am not mistaken, it was $2 billion in November. We are losing ground on international markets, but the Conservatives continue to drag their feet when it comes to rail transportation. We need to go beyond Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. We need to protect our shippers, and we must also provide our country with a genuine nation-wide strategy for rail transportation, both for passenger and for freight transportation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178180"> In my riding, only one municipality has rail service: the municipality of Rivière-à-Pierre. It is located in the northwestern corner of the riding, on the rail line that goes to Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean. These trains provide services primarily to hunters who go out into the wild and enjoy nature up there. There are very few passengers. The government must take action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178181"> Let us start with Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, but let us go further and develop a real strategy for the railways.</ParaText>

Otherwise one would be talking about her region, the Quebec City region.</ParaText>

We try to co-operate with CN and act as an intermediary to help these businesses. In my experience, as I said in my speech on this bill, it can be difficult to work with CN or CP. These companies are sometimes indifferent, since they have their monopoly, and they can be a bit stubborn. We are quite willing to work with them to improve the lives of the people affected by rail services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178185">I wonder if she could tell us a bit about her own experience and if she has found the same thing. Or perhaps she could use this opportunity to remind the House why it is important to encourage CN to have agreements like the ones proposed in this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178187">It is of the utmost importance that we continue to try to work with CN and CP to improve rail service across the country. I cannot stress this enough. In my speech, I mentioned that there are several large companies in my riding that depend on the rail system in the region to ship and receive the materials they need for production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178188">I am thinking about Alcoa, among others. The manufacturing of aluminum requires the transportation of a huge amount of raw and other materials.

              <ParaText id="3178194">Indeed, investment in passenger transportation in rural regions is one aspect of this issue that is unfortunately too often ignored and that should be put at the forefront. As for access to public transportation, my region is comparable to Pontiac. The only public transportation that exists is the bus. The people in this region set it up themselves. They arranged for access to these services, which they did not have before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178195">There used to be passenger rail service, but that was many years ago. The train goes to one community, which is at least an hour from Quebec City by car.

We really need a plan so we can ensure that our rural regions will have access to the same public transportation services available in other areas of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178196">It is similar to the commuter train principle in Montreal. It could be developed in the regions.

              <ParaText id="3178201">We will also support it because the majority of shippers are mostly or partially satisfied with it. We are going to respect their position and support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178202">There is something that sets us apart from the other parties recognized in this House: we listen carefully to the opinions and needs of Canadians and our country's businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178203">We consult them because we want to know what their needs are. That way, we can develop good public policies. We are not jamming measures down the throats of Canadians and businesses. At times, the party in power takes steps and imposes measures that no one wants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178204">However, my colleagues and I strongly believe that this bill must be amended since it does not fully meet its objective. The best that can be said for this bill is that it is only a half measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178205">Many of the demands of shippers were not included in the bill. What is more, the wording is very ambiguous. Some provisions must be examined more thoroughly in committee because they could potentially create loopholes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178206">The scope of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is also limited since it will cover only new agreements and, unfortunately, will not apply to existing agreements. That is a bit ridiculous. The bill is supposed to help shippers but, in reality, it applies to only a small number of them. Those who already have an agreement will be left to fend for themselves and will be at the mercy of the large CP and CN rail companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178207">Shippers will have to make do with low quality services until their contract ends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178208">How can the <Affiliation DbId="170701" Type="96">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> believe that this is a good bill that meets the needs of all shippers if it targets only a small fraction of existing agreements?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178209">Certain shippers wanted to tackle the issue of tariffs during the legislative process, but the Conservatives made it clear that they would not address that issue until the next legislative review of the Canada Transportation Act in 2014-15.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178210">In most regions of the country, shippers have no other choice than to use CN and CP. Canada's rail transportation market is basically a quasi-monopoly. Having the dominant position in the market allows the rail companies to charge often exorbitant prices, and shippers are put in a position where they have no choice but to accept the price charged by the rail company. That is what happens when this type of market is not regulated enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178211">The goal in committee will be to seek amendments that prevent potential abuse of power by requiring service level agreements between shippers and rail companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178212">We also need to establish dispute resolution processes. This bill offers only a limited arbitration process. It is available only for shippers who are in the midst of negotiating new contracts. It will not apply to existing agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178213">Instead of offering fast, reliable dispute resolution for all shippers, as we are asking for, the bill is limited to a small group of shippers. The proposed arbitration process may be too costly for many shippers. The burden of proof may be unfair if they have to prove that they are in need of services from the railway.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178214">We would also like to see tougher penalties included in the agreements in relation to service levels, in order to compensate shippers for service disruptions, damage and loss of productivity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178215">As it stands now, the bill provides for penalties of up to $100,000, which would be paid to the federal government rather than to shippers. Since shippers must cover their losses, this would obviously impact the price they charge consumers. We lose on two fronts, because it hurts consumer prices, and it makes Canadian businesses less competitive and less productive in international markets. Considering that CN made about $2.7 billion in profit in 2012, penalties need to be higher to really act as a deterrent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178216">Let us be very clear: 80% of rail freight customers are currently unhappy with the rail service. They are victims of the near monopoly held by railway companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178217">That near monopoly impacts sectors like agriculture, mining, forestry and auto manufacturing. Missing rail cars and other disruptive events result in rotting crops, service disruptions and delays. There is no compensation for all the forest, mining and manufacturing products that are wasted this way, many of which are actually intended for export.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178218">A number of factors disrupt economic activity in these sectors and impede Canada's economic prosperity. These resources and products are largely intended for export. Unfortunately for these industries, those who cause disruptions pay no compensation.</ParaText>

In 1968, he became the first African-Canadian member of Parliament and Conservative, serving for over 15 years. He later became the first African-Canadian Lieutenant Governor, and focused on education, racism and youth issues in Ontario. His remarkable life and tireless dedication serve to inspire future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178232">In November, I received a package containing a petition from Ms. Makarewicz's grade 6 class from Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Elementary School in Grimsby.

              <ParaText id="3178233">The students were truly moved by her story and were shocked that 32 million girls worldwide are not in school today. They created and circulated a petition to staff and students in the school, bringing attention to Malala's story and the fundamental right to education for girls all around the world. Although this petition does not meet the guidelines for a petition to be certified, their efforts should still be recognized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178265">Fortis, B.C. has made an application with the B.C. Utilities Commission to introduce wireless smart meters in our area. According to Flynn, the ambient level of electromagnetic resonance in our society is already extremely toxic and wireless smart meters will dramatically increase this danger. Flynn noted that Canada's Safety Code 6 guidelines are based solely on industry studies, which consider only thermal effects but ignore the known and dangerous effects of non-thermal microwave radiation on biological systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178266">In keeping with the precautionary principle being urged by numerous independent scientists around the world, we should only consider installing wired meter technology in all our homes, as it is risk-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178267">Thanks again to Cliff and Jerry for increasing our awareness.</ParaText>

This $20 billion job-killing carbon tax will make it harder for Canadians to take these vacations in the future, because they will be paying more for everything, including gas, groceries and electricity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178317">Mr. Speaker, we know that the best way to create jobs is actually to reduce taxes, which is why we have done that 140 times. That is why the average family pays $3,000 less in tax today as a result of our changes. Perhaps that is why we have seen over 900,000 net new jobs since the economic downturn, the very best track record on job creation in the entire G7. In fact, it is a record we expect to continue into the future. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Canada will see that prosperity continue, as a leader, into the decades ahead.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178489">Mr. Speaker, before being interrupted by question period, I was talking about elements that destabilize economic activity in certain industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178490">Unfortunately for the industries, they are not compensated by the parties responsible for these disturbances. We are talking here about hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Seventy per cent of our goods are shipped by rail. Considering the $2 billion trade deficit and fierce international competition, we cannot afford to opt for the status quo or for a half measure like the one proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. This situation, unfortunately, gives a trade advantage to our competitors around the world. They have the capacity to deliver their goods more rapidly and more punctually, despite the fact that our Canadian products often have a shorter distance to cover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178491">Unfortunately, for too long now, the government has not wanted to act. The Conservatives have been waiting since 2007 to introduce this bill, and when we take a look at their inaction and the cutbacks they have made over the past few years, we may conclude that they do not understand how important our railway system is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178492">On our side of the House, through the bill introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, we have conveyed the shippers’ demands in an attempt to restore the balance in their relationship with the railways. Canada needs a national transportation strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178493"> Greater use of rail transportation would have a positive impact on the quality of our environment and would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Unfortunately, when shippers cannot obtain services from our only two rail service providers, they will rely even more heavily on trucking, which will have a negative effect on our economic activity from an environmental point of view. We sense a lack of commitment by the Conservatives to our railway network, as evidenced by the lack of investment in railway infrastructures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178494"> We must therefore restore the balance between the railway companies and shippers. Our position is a simple one: we are on the side of businesses and exporters, and we are determined that they should receive the railway services they deserve and that they need. As usual, this government is on the side of big businesses that have a near-monopoly and is not interested in protecting SMEs through a bill that would have given them a leg up in international markets. If the government ultimately gives in, it will be attributable primarily to co-operation among the various industrial associations that banded together to advocate for legislative changes to the Canada Transportation Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178495"> Therefore, I would ask the government to work with us when the bill is being considered in committee. The competitiveness of our companies and our SMEs depends on an efficient rail transportation system. Canada’s economic vitality also depends on it. Our businesses need good services in order to make investments and create jobs. We will therefore support this bill. We ask that the government co-operate with opposition MPs to improve the bill and contribute to Canada’s solid economic growth. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178506">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have 10 minutes to talk to the House about my party's viewpoints and my own on Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, which I have here in my hands. This government bill amends the Canada Transportation Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178507">I would like to preface my remarks with a comment on the atmosphere here this morning. We are talking about and debating a government bill, but none of the MPs who have agreed to debate this bill in the House belong to the governing party. There are three possible reasons for that, reasons that may be unknown to members of the public, who I hope are listening on CPAC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178508">It may be a strategic move to put a lot of pressure on the opposition members, forcing them to work hard in the hope that they will exhaust their resources. But I have news for the government: we have many very young MPs who can work very hard for long hours. If that is its tactic, perhaps it should think of a new one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178509">If that is not the case, then it might be something that worries me a little more: contempt for the parties affected by its own bill, perhaps even contempt for the work of parliamentarians. We belong to a Parliament. When we are here on the Hill, we are paid very well to do our jobs as parliamentarians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178510">The government introduced a bill of major importance to the Canadian economy, but its members could not even be bothered to stand up in the House to explain their government's position. That reminds me of the time a few years ago during an interview while Parliament was prorogued when the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>—only for another two years—came right out and said that he thought shutting down Parliament would be better for the economy. He was quite serious when he said that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178511">After considering all the possibilities, we think we have the answer. We see this as a very clear demonstration of the utter contempt this government has for our parliamentary duties. All modern legislation has regulations. Many members of the current government seem to live in a fantasy world of libertarianism. We sometimes wonder if it should not be called the conservative libertarian party of Canada, whose answer to everything would be the invisible hand of the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178512">In good legislation, there is no place for that kind of fantasy. Furthermore, I challenge any one of my colleagues across the floor to name a single piece of legislation, from anywhere in the world, that has followed that logic through to its conclusion and has been beneficial for the people. It simply does not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178513">Modern legislation needs to strike a balance among people—the buyer and seller, those who need a service and those who provide that service. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178514">There are near monopolies or duopolies, as in the case of credit cards and rail freight transportation. There are just a few huge companies that provide a service to thousands of users. It is impossible to think that, within such a completely unbalanced framework, the invisible hand of the market can balance everything. That is impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178515">That is why it is our duty as parliamentarians to ensure balance and some degree of fairness, and to promote commerce not just for a small number of huge companies, but for all Canadian companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178516">Let us come back to the bill before us today, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178517">I would like to point out that my party and I will be supporting Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, despite its many weaknesses. We will do so mostly to address the needs of this country's rural areas. But this bill is merely half a step, and not quite in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178518">However, out of respect for people in rural areas, who really need to have their processed goods and raw materials shipped efficiently, even a small, flawed, sideways, ill-conceived step is better than nothing. Therefore, we will be supporting this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178519">I was saying earlier that we are dealing with a duopoly that has created a ridiculous situation: 70% of our primary processed materials, our natural resources, are shipped by rail by two companies. Eighty per cent of shippers are dissatisfied. It is impossible that 80% of the country's entrepreneurs have suddenly caught the “complaints” bug for no reason. We have to think of the consequences of this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178520">At present, some shippers are unable to enter into reliable and clear agreements that would allow them to provide services themselves to other companies, even internationally, with reliable transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178521">Shippers that have an agreement regularly have to deal with delays that are so long they result in catastrophic scenarios where assembly lines in Canada are slowed down. I will say it again because it is such a big problem: time and again assembly lines are slowed down. It is not because people are not qualified or are not willing to work. It is because they are waiting for parts that have been delayed by an inadequate rail transportation system. This represents tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars in lost efficiency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178522">For other shippers, it is a question of the lack of availability. For example, a certain tonnage of materials could be shipped to China, but shippers are unable to sell their products. It is not for lack of supply or because they cannot meet demand. It is because the link between Fermont and China is slowed down by poor rail service. How do you put a price tag on such losses in a global economy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178523">I would like to point out a fairly disturbing aspect of the Conservative's approach to the economy. They spend a lot of time botching free trade agreements. They have been signing agreements with many countries as quickly as possible, even if the agreement is flawed and provides for much less than what Canada could require. The Conservatives are focusing on quantity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178524">Meanwhile, they are not making the necessary efforts to ensure that Canadian companies remain competitive. Some ways of achieving this would be through decent transportation, a credit card system that does not charge exorbitant fees, and a research and development program. Although our Canadian entrepreneurs have a great deal of expertise, we must make their job easier so that they are able to be competitive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178525">The government has not managed to do that, but it is rushing to open markets left and right by signing agreements that are all too often flawed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178526">To summarize, the Conservatives do not care about keeping companies competitive. We should not be surprised to see an increase in our trade deficit, which recently reached $2 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178527">The bill is flawed and was introduced only because one of our colleagues, who introduced a bill on the protection of railway customers, exerted a lot of pressure. Her bill was clearly worded and truly designed to help those experiencing this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178528">As I mentioned earlier, the bill is weak, particularly when it comes to the arbitration process, because it puts the burden of proof solely on shippers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178529">One of the clauses of the bill says that both parties must consent to arbitration. As a result, if a large company says that it does not want arbitration, the case will end up in court. My colleague from Côte-Nord can attest to this. An SME could, once again, end up in court with a mega-corporation. We know how these types of situations turn out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178530">We will support this bill, but we hope that it will be improved by the standing committee.</ParaText>

Two massive companies regularly face off in arbitration with medium-sized companies and sometimes even small companies with far fewer resources, but the cost is the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178535">I would like to read out a provision that really concerns me:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178536">

              <ParaText id="3178537">So people have a contract and go to arbitration. What happens if the big company says no? They will end up in court and the costs will be insane.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178541">Mr. Speaker, in fact there is one other aspect that is just as important as the others that I wanted to bring to the attention of the House, and that is the fact that, generally speaking, rail services are underdeveloped in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178542">We missed an historic opportunity during the 2008-09 post-recession recovery planning phase. For example, of the billions of dollars spent by developed nations to recover from the 2008 recession, South Korea put a large percentage into rail networks. Why? I believe it was trying to achieve two things. First, rail transportation is one of the sectors that creates the most jobs. Second, when the IMF eventually evaluates whether the country's economy is healthy or not, railways are something tangible. The money invested in them did not disappear; it was spent on goods that are part of the country's inventory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178543">South Korea did not squander its resources on programs that do not always produce results in the long run. It invested in transportation. Now that the crisis is coming to an end, South Korea has a high-performance network to offer its people and businesses. Did the Conservative government have even an ounce of the wisdom the Koreans did? Absolutely not.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170604" Type="2">Mr. Jonathan Genest-Jourdain (Manicouagan, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178544">Mr. Speaker, in my speech on rail transportation in Canada, I will focus on the need to support rail services. The aim is to reduce road transportation and to support environmental and social objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178545">As is my wont, I will tie this speech to personal experience by focusing on the industrial boom that is currently occurring in my riding. For those Canadians and parliamentarians who keep up with current events, the riding of <Affiliation DbId="170604" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> is presently undergoing a mining boom and unprecedented industrial development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178546">The remainder of my remarks will focus on iron mining and hydroelectric projects and the announcements that have been made regarding them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178547">Despite the announcements by various governments, freight transportation occurs mostly over land. Freight to major work sites is primarily shipped by road trains. There are projects under way all along highway 138, between Quebec City and Sept-Îles, and even as far as Natashquan, which is where the highway ends. A little over 1,000 km separates Quebec City and Natashquan. It is possible to get there via Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. Highway 138 also goes to Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. Freight can therefore be transhipped and transported on highway 138 via Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178548">Highway 138 is currently in a terrible state of disrepair. This is not because of a lack of investment in upgrading and maintenance. It is the result of heavy vehicle traffic. I travel regularly from Ottawa to Sept-Îles. It is a 14-hour drive. I can say that it is not safe to drive along some stretches of highway 138.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178549">Despite everything that has been done, new repairs and upgrades are required every year. Road train traffic undermines all these efforts. The weather conditions also affect the maintenance of highway 138. It is quite dangerous to drive on some stretches of highway 138. Drivers who travel on highway 138 often have to deal with road trains and trying weather conditions. The media often report accidents involving road trains on highway 138. I am not saying that it is the norm and that accidents occur every week, but they happen enough to warrant me mentioning them today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178550">Highway 138 presents a problem in terms of both greenhouse gas emissions and public safety. These are concerns that warrant public attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178551">In my speech, I will mention the three major rail transportation companies. There are rail transportation companies in my riding, but they are private companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178552">The company Québec Cartier Mining, which is located in Port Cartier, provides rail transportation. Moreover, QNSL, Quebec North Shore and Labrador, which is now the property of Rio Tinto—that is what I was told yesterday when I did my research—also provides rail transportation. Finally, there is Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc. It specializes in transporting passengers traveling as far as Schefferville. The company also transports iron ore. That is what I was told when I did my research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178553">Québec Cartier Mining ships freight from Port Cartier to Fermont. Quebec North Shore and Labrador, Rio Tinto, transports to Wabush. Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc, which is the third biggest passenger carrier after CN and CP—I was also told his—transports passengers to Schefferville, but has to borrow a stretch of track owned by QNSL, which is Rio Tinto Alcan.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178554">Establishing a rail transportation network that connects Sept-Îles and Baie-Comeau is a priority, especially given the intermodal maritime–rail facilities that are located in these major cities in my riding. Maritime and rail transportation connecting these communities would significantly reduce trucking between these two points, thereby minimizing the number of accidents that result from poor road conditions and interaction between commercial and non-commercial vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178555">Based on my experience, which is shared by industry specialists, it is important to combine different modes of transportation in my riding, including the blue highway—sea transportation—, and transport by truck or rail. This will make for an effective transportation network and not put undue pressure on the road network, which is currently the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178556">Announcements were made regarding the La Romaine project, for which some of the construction material will be transported by sea. However, no concrete results have been seen yet in Havre-Saint-Pierre and the project is not yet underway. Most freight is still shipped by road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178557">Trucking also includes the transportation of prefabricated homes and modular units. It can be a real problem to pass a trailer transporting a modular or prefabricated home when driving on highway 138 for 7, 10 or 14 hours, if going to Natashquan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178558">All these factors create a need for federal authorities to invest in the development of the railway system, and particularly to ensure that these three private players do not have a monopoly. The fact is that, in the end, because they are private players, competing companies simply cannot use the tracks, unless they do like Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc., which must pay $50,000 per trip to use QNS&amp;L's tracks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178559">Right now, competition on tracks that were built by a corporate entity is not tolerated. That is why there is a need for the government to invest and ensure that all users can benefit from the railways and infrastructures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178560">Industrial development in Manicouagan and the increase in international investments in the mining sector justify a significant involvement in railways by the state, to give a national dimension to infrastructures, which would then be made available to every player in the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178561">Given the many announcements of foreign investments, if all foreign partners who show up on the north shore and in Manicouagan decide to build their own rail lines, they will multiply. In my view, and in the view of many stakeholders, it would be more effective to share already existing and functional tracks and infrastructures, given their lifespan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178562">Now, we have to wonder whether the development of the trucking industry as the only carrier is really not the result of an oil and trucking lobby. This is another issue that was brought to my attention, since I was told that, not to long ago, Quebec had a good railway system and that it was dismantled in the 1990s. That said, I am not an expert on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178563">I humbly submit these views to the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178568">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178569">What we are observing is a blind delegation of the parameters for building and establishing these private rail systems. That is what we are seeing at present in my own riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178570">I referred to Tshiuetin Rail Transportation, which carries people in partnership with the Innu and Naskapi. That is noteworthy nevertheless. I mention it today as an excellent initiative, but it is in the private sector. So this problem exists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178571">The environmental impact that road transport involves or can have is obvious. You should see the colour of my car after I have travelled on highway 138 alongside extended tractor-trailers for the entire trip. That is a simple demonstration that there are constant greenhouse gas emissions. There are emissions that exceed the established standards. This is quite simply a real problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178572">The federal authorities need to have the genuine will now to invest in these alternative measures and in creating a rail network. Perhaps this is not as applicable for the 700 km between Quebec City and Sept-Îles, but there are sections of highway 138 that could be improved if heavy equipment were transported by rail. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178575">It is important to be consistent. For instance, it was announced that the Route Bleue, which goes through my region, would be maximized. We are still waiting for that to happen. We are waiting to see this wishful thinking—which was announced to placate the population—put into action. The same thing happened with the announcements made regarding the Romaine project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178576">I would point out to my colleagues that the Route Bleue and the St. Lawrence River are being underutilized at this time for heavy equipment transport. This would take considerable weight off of highway 138, which is already in very bad shape. Furthermore, considering the mileage on my 2012 vehicle, the rocks that are all over the road and the state of my windshield after driving on that road for a few years, I would say that using the St. Lawrence more to transport heavy equipment would be a much better idea.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178577">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act (administration, air and railway transportation and arbitration)</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178578">I will say right away that we will support this bill at second reading, even though it is flawed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178579">Some 80% of rail freight service customers, that is to say shippers, are not satisfied with those services. They asked the government to take action and to introduce legislation compelling CN and CP to enter into service agreements with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178580">As I mentioned, this bill is a first step, but it is not a panacea, on the contrary. Shippers are having trouble getting fair and reliable rail freight services. Some of them cannot even sign contracts with major railway companies, which experience significant delays or do not have enough cars at their disposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178581">The Conservatives finally introduced this bill to address some of those problems after the NDP critic tabled her bill introducing the rail customer protection act last spring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178582"> The NDP transport critic did a very good job on railways. She is also working very hard on public transit and has suggested that we have a national public transit strategy. The Conservatives should entertain that strategy, but they are unfortunately still turning a deaf ear. It would be good if they listened to all these good ideas on public transit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178583"> As I mentioned earlier in asking my honourable colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170604" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> a question, the railway is Canada's raison d'être. It is a historic and essential factor for Canada. The level of service has been declining for some time now. The government has stopped investing in infrastructure, and legislation does not have enough teeth to force businesses to invest in that infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178584"> Consequently, we are using the roads and trucking far too much, when we could be using the railway. The benefit of doing so would be considerable, not only for our roads, which are being damaged, but also for the environment because the railway is a very environmentally friendly mode of transportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178585"> Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is a first step in the right direction, but it is far from perfect, since major demands by shippers have gone unheeded. Its ambiguous wording, for example, creates potential loopholes. The NDP will seek amendments at the committee review stage to prevent any abuses of market power by requiring that service agreements be reached and putting in place conflict resolution processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178586"> Rail freight services are currently of poor quality, and this is costly for the Canadian economy. In fact, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Many industries in Canada have to deal with rotten crops, work stoppages at plants and in mines and missing freight on a daily basis. Poor rail services hurt Canadian shippers and undermine our global competitiveness, in addition to costing jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178587"> We should rely much more on the railway, but in order to rely on it, it has to be efficient and first-class, so that businesses and SMEs use it more and more. In my region of greater Drummondville, the railway is an important industrial element, but it is not used as much as it could be. If we had a railway that was more efficient, more available and more reliable, and on which we could rely, I am sure that businesses in my region would use it more. This would be a win-win situation on all levels: our competitiveness, our economy and our environment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178588"> The Conservatives have not provided enough money for our infrastructures. Because of this, we now have a huge quality deficit, and one example of it is the poor condition of our network of railway tracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178589"> In addition, the Conservatives’ bill is very weak in that its safeguards do not cover existing contracts between shippers and railway companies, and it provides only a limited arbitration process in cases where negotiations on a new contract break down. Furthermore, we need to have a more global vision, as I mentioned earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178590"> Railway transportation is the backbone of Canada’s economy, as 70% of our goods are shipped by rail. It is therefore essential that railway services be advantageous both for shippers and for our railway companies. The high cost of railway services also has a negative impact on Canadian shippers. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> explicitly excludes the issue of rates, ignoring the demands of certain shippers’ associations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178591"> We should not forget Canada’s trade deficit, which continues to escalate. According to Statistics Canada, our trade deficit reached $2 billion in November 2012. This is clear evidence of the Conservatives’ failure. Not only does the Conservative government have the highest budget deficit in Canada’s history, but in addition, our trade deficit is clear proof of its failure across the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178592"> The fact that it ignored railway transportation is just more evidence of its economic failure. As I mentioned, 70% of our freight is shipped by rail. We must give much greater consideration to railway infrastructures and take a more global viewpoint. Not only was Canada built by the railway, which has quite a history in Canada, but in addition, the railway is clearly the way of the future. All modern societies are investing in railways. All societies that have a long-term vision are investing in the railway infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178593"> We have been asking for a long time for a national public transit strategy that would include the railways. Unfortunately, once again, the Conservative government has failed. This is a very serious matter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178594"> I am now going to digress from talking about Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> to make a brief aside. Recently, the environment commissioner issued his latest report. I would like to thank Mr. Vaughan for all the work he has done. In his latest report, he has done an excellent job for Canada and the environment. In the report, he mentions the annual financial support, in hundreds of millions of dollars, nearly $1 billion in total, that the Conservative government continues giving to coal, oil and natural gas, even though the money could be put toward a national transportation policy. This is very important. We think of public transit, but we should also be thinking about freight transportation. They go hand in hand. We will have to revisit this notion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178595"> Everything is interrelated. Transportation is related to the environment and to our economy. It is all part of the same thing. Unfortunately, as we have shown, the Conservative government has the largest budget deficit in Canada’s history, as well as a trade deficit that reached $2 billion last November, according to Statistics Canada. In addition, there has been a lack of investment in infrastructures. I would like to add that 80% of shippers are unhappy with the services provided by our railway system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178596"> This is clear evidence that the Conservatives have failed. The NDP must absolutely take their place so that we can implement a national transportation strategy. This will help the economy, the environment and transportation overall. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178623">Since its introduction just over a year ago, we have had a fulsome, positive debate at second reading and again at the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. I thank all members of the House, and specifically those on the committee, for their contributions to the debate. I am hopeful that we will soon see the bill enacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178624">The strong support that Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> has received thus far reflects the opinion of the vast majority of Canadians, who strongly oppose the bulk removal of water from Canada's freshwater basins. This is something I hear continuously from my constituents, family, friends and colleagues on all sides of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178625">This is an issue that I believe unites us as parliamentarians. Indeed, it is rare to have an issue that is so clearly one-sided in a country as large and diverse as Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178626">Canadians want to know that their federal and provincial governments will take the necessary steps to prevent bulk removals of water from ever happening. Why? Not only do bulk water removals pose a significant threat to ecosystems, but water is also an important component in the fight against invasive species. By removing a potential pathway for these species, we could help prevent the devastation these species' movement between basins could cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178627">When I was before the foreign affairs committee in October, I commented that no bill was ever perfect. All along I have been open to ways in which this legislation could be strengthened, which is why I would like to briefly explain one amendment that was made to Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> in committee, an amendment that I believe makes it a strong bill. Here I refer to the addition of purpose clauses to the sections of the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act and the International River Improvements Act that contain the bulk water removal provisions. In my view these clauses clearly articulate that the purpose of these bulk water removal provisions is to prevent the potential harm these removals could cause to Canadian ecosystems and to reinforce our desire to prevent harm to the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178628">As most members know by now, Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> amends the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act to bestow on transboundary waters—those that flow across the boundary—the same protections currently in place for boundary waters, those waters that straddle the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178629">Speaking of that, I live on one of the Great Lakes, and that water also borders on the United States. I know exactly where we are coming from on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178630">While the provinces have laws, regulations or policies in place to prevent the bulk removal of waters from their territories, our hope is that with Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> we will enhance protections at both the federal and provincial levels. Rest assured that we will continue to work with the provinces to ensure that these waters are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178631">The second amendment provided for in Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> is an amendment to the International River Improvements Act, which prohibits the issuing of a licence for an international river improvement that would link waters that are neither boundary nor transboundary with an international river if doing so would increase the annual flow of the international river at the boundary. This specific provision would ensure that an international river is not used as a conveyance or a pathway to move water in bulk outside of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178632">This last amendment was recommended by water experts from the program on water issues at the Munk School of Global Affairs in Toronto. In fact, testifying before the standing committee on October 25, the water experts voiced their support for Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>, with one stating that:</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178634">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Munk School experts for their role over the years in Canadian water policy debates, and especially for the assistance they have provided to me on the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178635">Next, Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> moves some definitions and exceptions from the regulations of the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act into the act itself. As has been touched upon in previous debates, moving definitions and exceptions into the act would entrench key definitions such as what constitutes the removal of water in bulk.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178636"> These exceptions would allow for the removal of water temporarily for emergency or humanitarian purposes such as firefighting, but not for commercial purposes. These exceptions are reasonable and are not inconsistent with the purpose of the bulk water prohibition. Now that these definitions and exceptions are to be moved into the body of the act, any changes would have to be approved by Parliament. This would provide members of this House with much greater oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178637">During committee consideration of Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>, there was some discussion about the definition of “bulk removal”. In the bill, “bulk removal” is defined as removing water from boundary or transboundary waters and taking it outside the Canadian portion of the water basin in which it is located. If the means of diversion include canals, tunnels, pipelines or other channels, for example, any removal is prohibited. In other words, any attempt to transfer even a drop of water outside the basin of a boundary or transboundary water using a canal or some kind of channel would be prohibited. By other means, one could not take more than 50,000 litres outside the basin per day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178638">Some members of the committee were concerned that this would be a potential loophole in the legislation. I want to be clear that this would not be a loophole. Even though 50,000 litres seems like a large number, it is no larger than a tanker truck or average residential swimming pool. As such, this could not be considered a bulk removal, and in fact could not be considered economically feasible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178639">I would like also like to address another area of the bill raised at committee regarding manufactured products containing water. As the bill states, “bulk removal does not include the taking of a manufactured product that contains water...outside the water basin...”. This includes water and other beverages in bottles or containers. This is included to ensure legitimate commerce, such as the products of breweries, soft drinks, juice, or even bottled water manufacturers, is not interfered with. My goal in introducing this legislation, and I believe it is the goal of others in this House, is to remove the threat of bulk removals of water, not prevent breweries and other manufacturers from selling their fine products around the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178640">Finally, I would like to take a minute to highlight the deterrence aspect of Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>. Bill C-383 proposes amendments to strengthen the enforcement authorities, fines and sentencing provisions of the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178641">These amendments include mandatory minimum fines for designated offences and increased maximum fines for all offences. For instance, violations of this act could result in a fine of up to $1 million for an individual and up to $6 million for a corporation for a first offence. In addition, these fines would be cumulative, meaning that every day the violation occurs is considered a separate violation. Fine totals could increase very rapidly. I believe that in itself would provide a strong deterrence against even contemplating violating the terms of this act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178642">Added to this, there would also be the potential for further fines under this act. Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> contains provisions that would allow the courts to add increased fines for aggravating factors such as damage to the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178643">As members know, my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> is nestled between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. It is basically surrounded on three sides by waters that would come under this act. It is an area where we have some of the greatest sources of water in this country. Coming from this part of the country, I have a deep appreciation for Canada's water resources. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178644">Although water seems abundant and everlasting, I do not, and we should not, take this resource for granted. I understand that we, as Ontarians, and we, as Canadians, must be responsible stewards of our water. I want to ensure this resource remains protected for my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren and for generations into the future. I introduced Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> in order to play a small part in protecting Canada's water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178645">We all agree that potential harm to Canada's water from bulk removals is too great to ignore. I urge all members of the House to vote for this measure.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178659">I will start by saying that the NDP will be supporting this bill despite all its flaws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178660">This bill would amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act to strengthen prohibitions against the bulk removal of water and to enhance current protections. The bill applies to all transboundary waters between Canada and the United States, waters that flow from Canada to the United States and rivers that flow to the United States. If I am not mistaken, the Saint-François River, in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="170228" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation>, is affected by this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178661">This bill is very important to me because water is one of the world's greatest natural resources. Water is an incredible resource. It should even be a human right. The United Nations General Assembly recognized the right to water. On July 28, 2010, the General Assembly adopted, by an overwhelming majority, a resolution recognizing the human right to water and sanitation. It is a right that is essential to human survival. It is such a fundamental right that violating it can cause death in just a few days if people do not have access to drinking water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178662"> Canada is very rich in water, in lakes and rivers of all sizes. Our country's water should be protected by a far-sighted national water policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178663"> After a series of promises from the Conservatives, this bill is before us at last. However, it does not address the most likely threat to Canadian waters: the interbasin transfer of water. Those are neither boundary nor transboundary waters, but they could be linked to international waters that flow from Canada to the United States and then exported to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178664"> While Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> is a step in the right direction, it clearly does not ban all bulk exports of water. My colleague mentioned in his question that the bill has some serious weaknesses that could lead to bulk exports of water. We will continue our fight to reach our objectives. The NDP is completely opposed to bulk water exports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178665"> Thus, we want to ensure that all surface water is protected, that any eventual water exports by tanker ships are regulated, and that NAFTA's threats to our water supply are opposed. What is needed is a coordinated plan by all provinces to establish measures that ban the removal of water in bulk. We must call for the signing of bilateral agreements that would prevent the United States from acting unilaterally to import water and would address the issue of the exemptions under the act that allow the export of bottled drinking water and other beverages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178666"> As we can see, this would not be just a little bill about boundary waters. We want it to have a much larger scope. It would truly be a national water policy. In order to accomplish this, we need a government that really understands the importance of water to Canada. Unfortunately, the Conservative government is not demonstrating such an understanding at this time. The Conservatives prefer to act through little bills and little actions. We see that such actions are not part of a vision. The Conservatives do not have much of a vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178667"> When we were talking earlier about the railways, it was the same thing. It lacked vision. This bill shows that the Conservatives have no vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178668"> In the NDP, we have a real, overall vision of what a national water policy to prevent bulk water exports should be.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178669"> NAFTA defines water as a product. That is why that agreement has long been considered a threat to Canada's sovereignty over its water resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178670"> On February 9, 1999, the House of Commons adopted an NDP motion calling for an immediate moratorium on the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers. The motion also called on the government to introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater exports and interbasin transfers. Furthermore, the motion asked that the federal government not be a party to any international agreement that compels Canada to export freshwater against its will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178671"> It should be clear to everyone that the NDP has been working on this issue for a long time and working in this field for a long time. For many years, the NDP has called for a ban on bulk freshwater exports. The NDP has been the leading voice in this. We even have an idea for a national water strategy, which is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178672"> I would also like to talk about a recent report by the Commissioner of the Environment, Mr. Vaughan. The report was released last week. And I would like to thank Mr. Vaughan again for the excellent work he has done for Canadians. He has done an excellent job as environment commissioner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178673">In his recent report on the environment, he said that the federal government has not done its job when it comes to shale gas. According to Environment Canada, Health Canada and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that health and the environment are protected against chemicals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178674"> At present, the federal government does not require mandatory disclosure of the chemicals used by shale gas companies. This is very serious, in spite of what they would have us believe. Every year, about 600 shale gas wells use the equivalent of 360,000 Olympic swimming pools of water, all mixed with 900 Olympic swimming pools of chemicals. When they say it is just a bit of chemicals seeping into the ground and into our environment, they forget to mention that it is mixed with a huge quantity of water, and that this amounts to a huge quantity of chemicals. The federal government, the Conservative government, is failing to protect our water, because it does not require mandatory disclosure of the chemicals used in the shale gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178675"> I am very proud of the position taken by the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">leader of opposition</Affiliation>, who is calling on the Conservative government to require mandatory disclosure of these chemicals. Unfortunately, the Conservative government is resting on its laurels and doing nothing about it. This is a threat to the environment and to people’s health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178676">In fact, the environment commissioner said that it is a violation of the Federal Sustainable Development Act, which includes the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle goes like this: when you are not sure, when you have doubts, and when there is a risk of a threat to health or the environment, you have to take precautions. If the Conservative government at least required disclosure of the chemicals, an appropriate analysis could be done and proper rules made and standards established for shale gas so that it is done in a way that is not harmful to the environment and human health. At present, we are in a complete vacuum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178677"> I have talked a lot about shale gas in this regard because I care a lot about it. My hon. colleague’s bill does not mention this national water policy, but it is necessary. What is missing is a more comprehensive vision, a broader vision. Water is a human right recognized by the United Nations. We have to have a strong national water policy that we can use to protect our environment and human health.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178678">Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House to announce that the Liberal caucus will support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178679">We will support it mainly because we pushed for the government to introduce measures regarding the water export threat. I admit that this is more of a future threat than a current one since, right now, there is not really any great threat to the export of Canada's fresh water. This threat will grow in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178680">We urged the government to introduce measures consistent with those proposed by the University of Toronto's Munk Centre, namely, an approach that is mainly environmental in nature that would prohibit water diversions from one watershed to another in Canada. Without this prohibition, it would be possible to export water. In order to conduct large-scale water exports, the water must leave one watershed and go through several others to get to another country, namely, the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178681">We will support this bill because we want to make it clear that we are against the idea of exporting fresh water outside Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178682">That being said, this bill has many shortcomings. In response to the question I asked earlier, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> said that we should not dwell on hypothetical situations. I raised the idea that an entrepreneur could want to export water from Gisborne Lake in Newfoundland to another country using tanker ships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178683">That is not a hypothetical situation. It happened. I believe a local entrepreneur in Newfoundland may have even signed a contract with another country to do exactly that, but the provincial premier at the time, the hon. Brian Tobin, stepped in and declared a moratorium thereby cancelling the contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178684">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> said that, if ever a province decided to lift its moratorium on the export of water, there would be a public outcry and people would rail against the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178685">Yes, I believe that  is what would happen today, but one never knows what might happen in the future. If a province is short on revenue and decides that it would be a good idea to export water and use the returns to fund its education or health care system, public opinion could change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178686">I would like to add that the president of the Fédération des médecins spécialistes du Québec, whose name escapes me right now, is in favour of exporting water from Quebec to fund the health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178687">Public opinion can change, based on the type of campaign used to promote an idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178688">I will set that aside for a moment to say that there are a number of flaws in this bill. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170228" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation> just mentioned a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178689">The bill does not prohibit bulk water exports using tankers. It does not exclude the possibility of exporting water from rivers that flow into coastal areas, as is the case in British Columbia. This water could be exported using tankers or floating bags.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178690">Even though my colleague would say the opposite, I doubt that this bill would prohibit the export of water to the United States via a pipeline.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178691">The government claims that since this bill, which applies primarily to transboundary rivers, prohibits exports from these rivers, it therefore prohibits exports via a pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178692">I am not sure that is the case. I would like to quote an expert, J. Owen Saunders, who works with the Munk Centre and who was involved when the centre presented the framework for a bill, which became my bill, to prohibit inter-basin water diversions in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178693">Here is what Mr. Saunders said in committee:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178695">That leaves the door open for a province to one day decide to lift its moratorium and sign a contract with an American company, and together the two could try to invalidate this aspect of the bill introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>. It could happen, and that is one of this bill's flaws.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3178696">I would like to address the point that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> has made on numerous occasions. His point was that my bill, which was voted on in the House and was defeated by the government, based on the work of the Munk Centre and the work of people such as J. Owen Saunders, was somehow unconstitutional because it was infringing on provincial jurisdiction. That is not the case. I asked Mr. Saunders that question in committee and he was quite categorical on that point. Preventing massive diversions of water from one water basin in Canada to another is a matter of national concern and fits within the peace, order and good government provisions of our Constitution. Therefore, I do not think that is a valid point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178697">I think that it would be a bigger challenge to work with the provinces on issues such as this. This is the kind of challenge that a federal government that really cares about our water security would want to take up with the provinces. If a federal government wants to get anything done in this very complex federation, it has to have the courage to sit down with the provinces and work it out. However, it is much easier not to do that and to pass something that is much more limited and may have some holes in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178698">I was hoping that we could have had more than one or two committee hearings on this issue. I was hoping that we could explore the issue of water exports within the context of NAFTA because this is where the issue gets complicated. This is why the hon. member has brought in the bill and why I brought in my bill. It is because there is still a lot of dispute as to whether our fresh water in its natural state is protected from the rules of free trade that are under NAFTA. It would have been good to explore that whole issue in committee. We might have drawn some conclusions about what more needs to be done to protect ourselves against the free trade provisions of NAFTA as they might apply to water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178699">If ever there is a dispute on this issue and there is a Canada-U.S. tribunal struck under NAFTA, do not expect the American members of that tribunal to take the same point of view we have, that water is not part of NAFTA. In the United States, water in its natural state is a commodity. Therefore, we know where they stand on this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3178700">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to join the debate on Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>, the transboundary waters protection act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178701">First, I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> for bringing this important legislation forward. The support that the bill has received so far is a testament to his efforts and reflects the position of Canadians from all regions of this country on the need to protect Canada's waters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178702">Bulk removals of water would pose a significant threat to Canada's environment. The protection of this resource is of vital importance to all Canadians. That is why, in 2008, our government made a commitment in the Speech from the Throne to put in place stronger protections to prevent the bulk removal of water. It is also why we introduced Bill <Document DbId="4518804" Type="3">C-26</Document>, which unfortunately died on the order paper with the 2011 election call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178703">Thanks to the work of the member from <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>, we have this bill before us. The time has now come for the House to pass the legislation, which would ensure Canadian waters are protected from bulk removals. I am glad to see that Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> is supported by the government and by members of all parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178704">As my colleague mentioned, the transboundary waters protection act would amend two acts: the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act and the International River Improvements Act. Amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act would prevent the bulk removal of water from transboundary waters, waters that flow across borders. Boundary waters that straddle the border, such as the Great Lakes, are already protected under the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act and its regulations. With the changes found in Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>, all of these waters under federal jurisdiction would be protected from the bulk removal of water to outside the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178705">There are other elements found in Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> that would strengthen protections against bulk removals. For example, proposed amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act would bring the enforcement authority fine schemes and sentencing provisions of the act in line with those found in the Environmental Enforcement Act, which delivers on the government's commitment to bolster protection of water, air, land and wildlife through more effective enforcement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178706">Provisions found in Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>, which would amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act, closely follow the regime from the Environmental Enforcement Act, in terms of the fine schemes. I must remind everyone again of these penalties. Sentencing provisions and enforcement tools would be available. These provisions would include mandatory minimum fines for designated offences and increased maximum fines of all offences under prosecution and conviction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178707">In addition to higher fines, the act would set out fine ranges that vary according to the nature of the offences and the type of offender, such as individuals, small revenue corporations and corporations. Each of these categories of offender would face stiff fines for violations. For example, individuals could face up to $1 million in fines and a corporation up to $6 million for the first offence. For a second or subsequent offence, the applicable fine range would double. Fines for contravening the law would be cumulative, meaning that a violation that continues for more than one day would be seen as a separate offence for each day that it continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178708">Further, the court must order an offender to pay additional fines if the court determines that the offender obtained any property, benefit or advantage from the commission of the offence. Courts also must consider increasing fines if the offence caused damage or risk of damage to the environment. As with the other federal environmental statutes that were amended through the Environmental Enforcement Act, the bill includes other provisions that would enhance the goals of deterrence, denunciation and restoration, which are the fundamental purposes of sentencing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178709">This legislation contains provisions aligned with the publication of information about an offence committed and the punishment imposed as well as provisions requiring that corporate shareholders be notified in the event of a conviction. The objective is to encourage compliance, given the importance of public opinion to corporate success. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178710">As we can see, this legislation provides strict consequences for violation of the act. The goal is quite simple: to deter anyone from attempting to violate the bulk removal of water prohibitions found in the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178711">Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> would also move certain definitions and exceptions from the regulations for the International Boundaries Water Treaty Act into the act itself. This would make it more difficult to change these definitions or exceptions at a later date and would provide Parliament with a stronger oversight role, should changes ever be considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178712">I would also like to take a few minutes to speak about the provision in the bill that would amend the International River Improvements Act. The purpose of the International River Improvements Act is to ensure that international rivers are developed and used in the national interest. International rivers are waters that flow from any place in Canada to any place outside Canada. The International River Improvements Act requires proponents that would like to construct improvements, such as dams, canals, obstructions, reservoirs or other works that would significantly alter the flow or level of any international river at the international boundary, to apply for a licence. This act allows the federal government to ensure that all such works are constructed and operated in a manner that complies with the Canada-U.S. boundary treaty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178713"> Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> would amend the act to prevent the use of international rivers to transfer large quantities of water across the border. As mentioned in previous speeches and during committee consideration of this bill, some water experts see the use of international rivers as a potentially efficient pathway for transferring water in bulk. To prevent this from happening, Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> would amend the International River Improvements Act to prohibit licences for linking waters wholly in Canada with international rivers and then using those rivers to move water in bulk across the border. This amendment to the International River Improvements Act would add another layer of protection against the bulk removal of water from Canada. It was endorsed by experts from the Munk School of Global Affairs during the recent standing committee consideration of Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178714">I would once again like to offer my thanks to the member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> for introducing this legislation. As we have seen, the bill is roundly supported by members of the House. I urge all members to support this legislation when it comes up for a vote.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3178715">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill introduced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>. Our party intends to support this legislation, and I commend my colleague opposite for bringing it forward. However, I particularly want to thank all the activists in Canada who have been urging the government for several years to protect our most precious resource, namely our water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178716">Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> amends the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act to strengthen the prohibitions against bulk water removal and to improve current protections. It targets all boundary waters between Canada and the United States, the waters flowing from Canada into the United States, and the rivers flowing into the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178717">In my opinion, this is an important piece of legislation that would help protect our resources. As a member of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, protecting Canada's waters is a major concern of mine. Therefore, I appreciate this opportunity to debate the bill, to stress its positive aspects, and to also discuss its limitations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178718">First, it is important to point out that the bill proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170502" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> is quite similar to the legislation presented by the Conservative government in 2010. Indeed, a bill was introduced following promises made by the Conservatives in the 2008 and 2009 throne speeches to introduce legislation to ban bulk water transfers or exports from Canadian freshwater basins.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178719">As hon. members know, the bill presented by the Conservatives was never passed because it never went beyond first reading stage. Of course, it was not a government priority. The reason I am discussing the similarities with the old legislation is not just to underline the Conservatives' inaction to this day, but also because one of the positive aspects of Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> is that it addresses a major flaw that existed in Bill <Document DbId="5254650" Type="3">C-26</Document>. Indeed, the latter did not protect Canadian waters from its most serious threat, that is transfers from a water basin that is neither a boundary nor transboundary water body from Canada into the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178720">As for Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document>, it proposes to amend the International River Improvements Act to prohibit the issuing of permits for projects that link non-boundary waters to an international river when the purpose of such projects is to increase the annual flow towards the United States. This is an important change that would prohibit the issuing of a permit to build, operate or maintain a canal or pipeline transporting Canadian water to an international river.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178721">Like its predecessor, Bill <Document DbId="5321564" Type="4">C-383</Document> has one major flaw: it does not prohibit all bulk water exports. That is why the NDP believes the legislation needs to go further. It must provide greater protection to this precious resource, water. We are hoping for legislation that provides for the protection of all surface water in Canada, the development of a plan coordinated with the provinces to implement the ban on bulk water removal, and the signing of binational agreements that would prevent the United States from acting unilaterally to import water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178722">Finally, the NDP especially wishes that the federal government will commit to addressing the threat posed by NAFTA to the sovereignty of Canada's water resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178723">For those who may not know that, under NAFTA, Canadian water is both a service and an investment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3178724">NAFTA defines water as a product. The definition of water as a good could weaken or invalidate provincial and federal legislation and regulations on the protection of our water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178725">In this regard, the Council of Canadians reminded us of the worrisome example of California's SunBelt Corporation. In 1990, SunBelt entered into an alliance with Canadian company Snowcap Waters to export bulk water from British Columbia to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178726">On March 18, 1991, the Government of British Columbia imposed a moratorium on water exports. That moratorium was followed by the provincial government passing the Water Protection Act, which banned water exports for good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178727">After the British Columbia government passed this legislation, SunBelt filed a lawsuit against Canada under NAFTA provisions and demanded $10 billion in compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178728">At last report, the matter was still unresolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178729">In order to deal with such threats, former NDP MP Bill Blaikie introduced, in 1999, an opposition motion that led to the moratorium on bulk water exports. The motion, which was adopted by the House, also tasked the government with introducing legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater exports and interbasin transfers. Furthermore, the motion stated that the federal government should not be a party to any international agreement that would compel Canada to export freshwater against its will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178730">The day after the motion was adopted, the Liberal government of the day announced a strategy to prohibit bulk water removal, including exports, in Canada's major basins. However, as was the case with many other grand Liberal announcements, the government did nothing tangible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178731">Needless to say, the NDP has not given up on its efforts to protect water. In June 2007, the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> moved a motion asking the government to initiate talks with the U.S. and Mexican governments to ensure that water is excluded from NAFTA. The motion was adopted by the House, but the government has not yet had serious discussions with these countries.</ParaText>

It has been unanimous support up to now. I am not taking anything for granted, but I certainly hope that continues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3178741">Regarding a couple of the members' comments today, I have to point out that they seem to want to interfere with and go into provincial jurisdictions. Then on the next breath they admit that would probably not be a very wise thing to do. I will leave you to speculate, Mr. Speaker, as to why they continue to do that. The bill would do what I want it to do and what most Canadians would want it to do. It does not cross boundaries, whether it is legal issues or provincial jurisdictions, and I think that is the wise approach on this. </ParaText>
