              <ParaText id="3207806">Mr. Speaker, in 2011 most voters did not get what they voted for. Whether they favoured Greens, NDP or Liberals, they often received a Conservative MP due to our undemocratic voting system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207807">Most of the world's democracies have some kind of proportional representation. If we had fair elections, then Conservatives would have only 122 seats, the NDP 96, the Liberals 58 and the Greens would have at least a dozen. Canadians would have the Parliament they voted for, most likely a NDP-Liberal-Green government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207808">Only one of the candidates running for the Liberal leadership has a real plan for electoral reform, putting democracy before party politics.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3207811">I was honoured to meet Alex Killby from London, as well as Nhattan Nguye, Cody Dixon and Heather Eskritt. These young people reminded me of my days in Scouts. Although it was many years ago, I remember well the lessons taught about integrity and personal conduct and how to develop survival skills, technical skills and confidence. These principles of duty to God, duty to others and duty to self resonate today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207812">In my city of London we have 30 Scouts groups with more than 1,000 members and 400 volunteers, with service ranging from one to 60 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207813">Just this past weekend London Scouting hosted a citizenship court welcoming 27 new Canadians, and 20 scouts received their pathfinder citizenship certificate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207814">Members may know that the Canadian General Council of the Boy Scout Association was incorporated by an act of the Canadian Parliament on June 12, 1914, so as scouting enjoys 100 years of service, let me on behalf of the House thank Scouts from across Canada for what they do to make London, Canada and our communities better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3207816">I made a speech and congratulated them on having the guts to take to the street to denounce this direct attack on our workers. The Conservatives are a threat to my region's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207817">This government wants to label the unemployed as good or bad. It is not as though they chose to lose their jobs; that is the reality, the up-and-down nature of seasonal work. This systematic labelling will erode seasonal industries and drive wages down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207818">I have a message for all Canadians. We need you if we are going to beat this reform. We will win the employment insurance fight today, and I can assure you that we will win the war in 2015, when we form the first NDP government in Canadian history.</ParaText>

Our conversation was carried out live through the ARISS amateur radio program. To say these students were very inspired by this experience is an understatement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3207822">Later in the day I visited Summerland Middle School and had the honour to present Canadian Olympian Kristi Richards with a Diamond Jubilee Medal. The staff and students at Summerland Middle School have a very special relationship with Ms. Richards. Kristi is a talented young leader and is a positive role model to young people in my riding.</ParaText>

The justice committee will hold final hearings today on my bill to make cyberbullies accountable, but it is only one small part of the action that we as parliamentarians must take to develop an anti-bullying strategy with education, prevention, accountability and rehabilitative components.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3207837">Shockingly, the opposition is not supporting this basic right for aboriginal women. They are putting political posturing ahead of these rights, rights that every other Canadian woman enjoys. This is shameful.</ParaText>

Under our government's economic action plan, we have created some 900,000 net new jobs since July of 2009. Moreover, our tax reductions have saved the average family $3,400 a year, and when we add the universal child tax benefit on top of it, that is an extra $2,400 a year for kids under six.</ParaText>

Canada has one of the lowest senior poverty rates in the world, thanks in part to our actions, which include removing hundreds of thousands of seniors from the tax rolls completely, making significant investment in affordable housing for low-income seniors and introducing the largest GIS increase in a quarter of a century. Canadians know that they can count on our government to deliver for seniors.</ParaText>

There is absolutely no question with respect to the facts that the minister has not been fully transparent with respect to the issue that has been in front of the House for the last several days, which is the question of performance payments made to members of the human resources Service Canada ministry with respect to the repayment of funds in the employment insurance plan.</ParaText>

It seems to me that the minister has to come clean and that the <Affiliation DbId="182412" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> has in fact raised a point that is not simply a point of debate but rather a point of fact. The government has not revealed and has chosen to obscure the nature of the payment system in the department concerned.

Instead they are persisting in denying something that is clearly the case.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208174">Mr. Speaker, I feel especially privileged to have the chance to speak twice on Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which amends the Income Tax Act. Not everyone has an opportunity to address this highly charged issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208175">As I mentioned the last time, this bill is nearly 1,000 pages long and makes a number of very technical changes to Canada’s tax system, changes that have accumulated over more than a decade. It seeks to obtain official approval for the various technical measures that have been put forward by the Minister of Finance over the years, over more than 10 years now, in fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208176">We in the NDP believe that the technical changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> will be good for the Canadian tax system and will generally reduce tax avoidance. This is why the NDP will be supporting the bill at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208177">The NDP believes that, as parliamentarians, as the elected representatives of Canadians, we have a duty to do whatever we can to minimize tax evasion and get rid of loopholes in our legislation, to ensure that the government has all the resources it needs to provide Canadians with the government services and institutions that they depend on and, more importantly, that they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208178"> Because of the Conservative government's budgets, we are facing drastic service cuts that will affect the Canadians who need those services the most. Money that is in the system could be invested in our social programs and in the institutions Canadians depend on, such as the universal public health insurance system. Ultimately, we could even set up other programs. Instead of being used to benefit the most privileged among us, this revenue should benefit the whole of Canadian society. It is important to do everything we can to bring the money back into the system so that the government can use it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208179"> It is all well and good to cut a little bit here, there and everywhere, but we must be able to generate the revenue we need so that we can maintain what we have achieved, improve and enhance existing programs, and then come up with new programs that meet the needs of Canadians. I think that if a government is not able to do this, it is not doing its job. Unfortunately, this is true of the current Conservative government. This is what the NDP will be changing in 2015, when it forms the government, of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208180"> Since the Conservatives would have us believe that they are good managers of public funds, I find it really surprising and very disappointing that they waited so long before doing what was needed to get the technical amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> through Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208181"> In fact, the most recent technical tax bill was passed in 2001. That is more than 10 years ago. By 2009, at least 400 technical amendments had still not been enacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208182"> Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> is huge, nearly 1,000 pages, and it clearly shows that this government must be more responsible in managing tax legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208183"> It is absolutely unacceptable to penalize taxpayers and the business sector by perpetuating so much uncertainty and unpredictability in Canada’s taxation amendment process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208184"> Furthermore, because the Conservatives are so slow, we are once again dealing with a massive omnibus bill and we have very little time to really study it and to examine the implications of its legislative measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208185"> It really is a shame that the Conservatives persist in using this strategy, which, frankly, hinders the work that we in the House must do, that is, to study and consider bills and their impact on the Canadian public. The fact that we are prevented from conducting our parliamentary work properly has a direct impact on Canadian democracy and Canadians’ trust in their elected officials. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208186"> At least things are a little better this time around because the Conservatives had the decency to combine a series of bills dealing with the same subject in Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document>. It is actually quite refreshing compared to Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, bills that sought to hide a raft of drastic and socially harmful changes in areas such as environmental protection, immigration, employment insurance, old age security and many more.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208187"> Despite all that, although tax measures are involved and it is all one subject, in general we are in favour of the bill’s content. However, the fact remains that we are dealing with a document that is incredibly long. We do not have much time to study the amendments, which are technical and relatively complex and merit careful study. A number of them have already been implemented by tax professionals, accountants and businesses, but some things are still not clear and should perhaps be given further consideration. Once again, we do not have an opportunity to do so, because this is an omnibus bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208188"> Every week, my constituents come into my office in <Affiliation DbId="170119" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> to tell me that they are tired of seeing these kinds of bills in the House, tired of seeing these huge documents and tired of seeing that their elected officials, whom they elected to represent them, are incapable of doing their job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208189"> Canadians are fed up with the way this government operates. Things have to change and quickly. The government needs to stop dragging its feet and establish a truly efficient process for quickly and regularly enacting the technical amendments in the comfort letters issued several times a year by the Department of Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208190"> I think the message is clear. I will repeat what a number of my colleagues have already said: we will be supporting the bill. However, we must ensure that a situation like the one we are faced with today will not occur again, and we must ensure that the government will present us with technical amendments on a regular basis so that we can do our job properly.</ParaText>

It is a question of justice and equality for each and every Canadian. These are honest people who are paying their taxes.

              <ParaText id="3208204">Second, it is also extremely important that we bring that money back to Canada, to the government, so that we can provide the programs and resources that our people are calling for, that they deserve and that they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208205">This government is making cuts in every department, except for the propaganda department, of course. We all have to listen to the half-truths that the government is spewing. It is spending millions of dollars on propaganda at taxpayers' expense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208206">It is making all these cuts, but it is never going to take in enough revenue to maintain what we have and improve existing programs. It is offering tax breaks to big business, letting people hide their money in tax havens, making cuts, lowering taxes and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208207">It has very little revenue, and it is not able to make the machinery of government work the way it should. And that is why it is so important to keep tax evasion in Canada to a minimum or eliminate it entirely.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208212">Tax evasion costs Canadians a lot of money. It is estimated that Canada foregoes revenue amounting to nearly $80 billion every year because of various forms of tax avoidance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208213"> Numerous measures can be adopted to deal with tax avoidance, including the fair and uniform application of tax rules, as is done in this bill, and the automatic exchange of tax information and adoption of a protocol for publishing the taxes paid by corporations. It is in fact impossible to enact all these measures without leadership from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208214"> I believe that this bill and the measures it includes are a step in the right direction, to help the government combat tax avoidance and deter these various practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208215"> Similarly, the bill talks about various measures to ensure that income received by residents of Canada from any source is taxed, and measures relating to the taxation of foreign affiliates of Canadian multinational corporations. The purpose of those measures is essentially to guarantee the integrity of the tax system and deter tax evasion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208216"> The bill also contains provisions implementing various technical measures that have been developed since 2002. Among other things, that part contains anti-avoidance measures, which I will not list because this is very technical, measures limiting the use of foreign tax credit generators in order to avoid foreign tax, measures setting out the rules for taxable Canadian property of non-residents and immigrants, and the creation of a regime for information reporting of tax avoidance transactions so that people can be informed about how avoidance occurs and avoid falling into that trap or to make it easier to identify these forms of avoidance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208217"> Any avoidance transaction that is for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit will now have to be reported for greater transparency, even if it is not improper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208218"> The bill also includes three new measures that we support and that had not been announced already. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208219"> First, a number of federal fiscal constraints will be rectified to solve transition problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208220"> Second, the formula for the attribution of taxable corporate income that applies to airline corporations is amended to ensure that the taxable income of one of these companies is entirely attributed to the provinces or territories where it has a permanent establishment. That is logical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208221"> Third, a measure relating to the tax treatment of shares owned by short-term residents for departure tax purposes. Obviously, this is all very abstruse, but it is part of the 1,000 pages being added. This adds to the complexity, which we find unfortunate in view of the fact that there have already been 3,000 pages of tax measures in the last few decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208222"> All in all, by ensuring the integrity of the tax law in force and minimizing the potential loopholes, these measures will operate to increase government revenue. As my colleague said, when government revenue is increased, then we can invest in social programs, for example, and in programs for health care, the environment and greater fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208223"> In its present form, however, the tax system is unendingly complex. That complexity affects individuals, for whom it is very difficult to plan their taxes with the vast menu of tax credits we now have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208224"> The tax system also poses problems for Canadian businesses and undermines their competitiveness. If they have to dissect it all and invest in administrators or accountants who have to analyze each of the 200 amendments being made a decade later, for example, that is money that they cannot invest in local jobs or jobs in their small business. It therefore reduces their productivity and competitiveness.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208225"> The difficulty of planning their spending also limits investments in innovation and hiring. Clearer tax rules could improve the competitiveness of our businesses and create more jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208226"> While we support the bill, the document is nearly 1,000 pages long and has all the makings of an omnibus bill, again. Obviously, the last technical tax bill, which was more than 12 years ago, incorporates certain legislative amendments, some of which go back to 1998. The enormous scope of this bill demonstrates that the government has to be a lot more responsible in its management of tax legislation and make sure that proposals relating to tax law are enacted more regularly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208227"> Unlike the gigantic budget bills, Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, the changes made do not affect a huge spectrum of legislation, and rather affect certain specific statutes. But this bill still does much to complicate the work that parliamentarians do in assessing bills, given that a lot of time is needed to process a bill and get through a thousand-page block, time that we do not have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208228"> As well, prioritizing the elimination of tax loopholes has to be done in a timely manner. Most of these measures have been adopted in current practice. The fact that they are not being enacted until years later brings an element of uncertainty and unforeseeability to the business world. Experience seems to tell us that it might be time to rethink how we do this. Tax bills should be much more modest—shorter, that is—and there should be more of them, introduced on a regular basis, to ensure that their provisions are implemented in a more timely manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208229"> In addition to legitimizing the work done by parliamentarians, that would operate to reassure the business world. It would also show that we are much more democratic and would mean we could avoid having unenacted tax measures accumulate, since this impedes progress, and at the same time allow us to improve and strengthen the Canadian tax system. It would also operate to facilitate financial planning and management for businesses, taxpayers and tax experts, who themselves have trouble making their way through all this jumble of rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208230"> As well, enacting tax measures speedily after they are announced would also enable the government to collect large sums of money that could be reinvested in programs for health care, education, food inspection and environmental assessment, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208231">This position is shared by many experts, including the former Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser, the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada, as well as Marlene Legare, former senior chief of the Sales Tax Division at the Department of Finance. They all agree that this will help improve the process and simplify our tax legislation, which is becoming increasingly complex. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208232">We recently led a campaign against the excessive fees that credit card companies are charging small and medium-sized businesses and other merchants. Businesses are already overwhelmed by all the paperwork. With all that those companies contribute to Canada, the Conservatives—who claim to be the best advocates of local economies and small and medium-sized businesses—are blocking the growth of local economies and job creation. It is hard to believe the Conservatives when they introduce these kinds of bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208233">In closing, in 2009, the former Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser, was already concerned about the fact that at least 400 technical amendments still had not been enacted through legislation. Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> enacts more than 200 of these measures and changes. I wish to echo Ms. Fraser's concerns, given that another 200 changes still have not been applied and remain outstanding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208234">Can the government tell us when it plans to incorporate those measures into legislation and how? It would be a shame to have to wait another 10 years before those changes are adopted, especially since, much like this bill overall, they will have a positive impact on Canada's tax system. Just like the measures that will be added to the legislation thanks to Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document>, the purpose of these measures is to ensure the integrity of our existing tax legislation, close the loopholes to discourage tax avoidance, increase our revenues and therefore take part in positive economics.</ParaText>

I also notice that Thomas McDonnell, who is a tax lawyer with Thorsteinssons, added what seem to be the comments of the general public about the omnibus budget bills by the government. He said, “My printed version of the changes and accompanying notes runs well in excess of 900 pages. The Bill will also be passed without much in the way of informed debate in the House”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208237">The hon. member has raised very validly the delay in bringing forward these kinds of changes. Clearly, the changes are long needed and are supported. Could she speak to whether it is important for the government to start bringing forward, at least on a yearly basis, these kinds of changes? At least then we could be sure that we were increasing the revenue side of the stream, if not the payouts to those who are deserving of the support of the federal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208248">We have just begun to really delve into this bill that is more than 1,000 pages long. Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> is absolutely enormous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208249">As my colleague just said, we are talking about measures that should have been taken 10 or more years ago. Some of them go back as far as 1998. We have to wonder why the government took so long to introduce this huge bill in the House. Why did it take so long to address the 200 various sectors affected by previous budgets? Why did the government drag its feet on introducing these technical amendments in the House?</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208250">When we look at the size and scope of this massive bill, we are talking about areas touched throughout the tax system: changing how labour-sponsored venture capital corporations are treated and the transitional issues that arise from that; amending corporate taxable income allocation formulas; looking at the tax treatment of shares dealing with offshore investment fund property and non-resident trusts; dealing with taxation of foreign affiliates of Canadian multinational corporations, affecting legislation that touches both common law and civil law; avoiding anti-avoidance measures for specific leasing properties; clarifying rules on taxable Canadian properties; looking at housekeeping changes to the Excise Tax Act; clarifying the minister's authority; allowing for tax administration agreements; and putting in place coordinating amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208251">Many of these measures date from more than a decade ago. As my colleagues from <Affiliation DbId="170535" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation> mentioned earlier, the former Auditor General of Canada called the government on its complete absence of bringing forward all of the 1,000 pages of technical amendments that should have been brought forward years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208252">Commitments were made at one point. I am not going to criticize just the Conservatives. I am going to criticize the Liberals, as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208253"> Indications were made in the past that these types of technical amendments should be brought in on an annual basis. What the Parliament of Canada would be called upon to look through would be, basically, one-twelfth of what we are looking at today. On an annual basis, technical treatment would then be updated. That is a necessary part of our tax system. That would mean, as well, that we would avoid the kinds of loopholes that exist when the House of Commons passes budgets or measures are put into place and the technical amendments are never brought forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208254">That is not what happened under the Liberals. We know now that the Liberals were simply unable to put in place an effective administrative structure for technical amendments. It has not happened under the Conservatives, either. This is something New Democrats deplore. Of course, we support these technical amendments, but instead of dealing with a yearly review that would allow those technical amendments to be brought in in a systematic way and on a timely basis, we are dealing with another massive Conservative bill of 1,000 pages that Parliament is being asked to scrutinize, because for over a decade, the work was not done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208255">This is symptomatic of why many Canadians consider the idea of Conservative administrative competence to be an oxymoron. We have seen this time and time again, whether we are talking about technical amendments that have not been brought in or massive budget bills that are thrown on the floor of the House of Commons without the government having any understanding of what the impacts are. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208256">We saw last spring massive changes to environmental assessments and the National Energy Board. Charitable people would say that the government was simply unaware of what it was trying to do when it gutted 99% of environmental assessments in this country. That is what a charitable person would say. The government was simply incompetent. Many others believe that it was mean-spirited and deliberate. Even though the government pretended that it had no idea that it was gutting 99% of environmental assessments in this country, the government actually did understand that it was doing that when it threw those amendments forward. Either way, what we are seeing is administrative incompetence and mean-spiritedness of the highest order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208257"> I am privileged to come from the political party that over the last 20 years, when it has been in power, according to the federal Ministry of Finance, has been the most effective at managing the nation's finances and paying down debt in various provinces. For the last 20 years, the fiscal period returns, year after year, have indicated that NDP governments are much better at balancing budgets and paying down debt. They are much better than their Conservative counterparts and much better than their Liberal counterparts, who seem to be even worse than the Conservatives, if people can believe that, in terms of balancing budgets and paying down debt. Fiscal period returns show that. We certainly have no lessons to learn from anybody. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208258">I would say to the Canadian public that we always have to endeavour to be better and more transparent. We had the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> stand in the House today and put forward an NDP bill to put in place a Parliamentary Budget Officer. What we believe in is a system of checks and balances, in terms of finance, to ensure that the public is aware that the figures we are putting forward are tested by an impartial third party. We believe in supporting our Auditor General's department and in actually enhancing the ability of the Auditor General to look at the nation's finances as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208259">What have the Conservatives done? It is quite the opposite. By death from a thousand cuts, they have cut back on the Auditor General's ability to actually look at the nation's finances. They are seriously, in the most vicious, underhanded way, attacking the Parliamentary Budget Officer. They are systematically removing, and this is the only government in the western world doing this, the checks and balances the Canadian public depends on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208260">On our side of the House, not only are we better financial administrators, we also believe in the impartiality of a third party to ensure and verify that the financial figures put forward by a government are tested and are subject to those rigorous tests of checks and balances the Canadian public expects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208261">In my riding of Burnaby—New Westminster, what I hear most often from people who voted Conservative last time, because I still had about a third of the public in Burnaby—New Westminster vote Conservative last time, is that they voted for administrative competence, and they have gotten incompetence. They say that they voted for some kind of honesty on fiscal matters and have gotten exactly the opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208262">People who voted Conservative are now saying that what they got is the F-35 scandal, the continuous shame of Conservative senators trying to bilk the public and milk the public of every last dollar, pretending they live in provinces where they do not and trying to break the law in a couple of jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208263"> What former Conservative voters, because they are not going to vote that way in 2015, are telling us is that it is not what they voted for, but that is what they have gotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208264">When we look back to Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document>, we can see that this is symptomatic of a much greater malaise. We have a Conservative government that is administratively incompetent, that is mean-spirited and that is unable to control the natural inclination of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to go after shiny baubles and pay whatever it takes, whether we are talking about the Muskoka spending of $1 billion or the $40 billion or more that would go into the F-35s or the ongoing scandal of Senate-gate, with 15 Conservative senators now trying to hide where they live to cover up their past indiscretions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208265">When we look at all of those things, what we see is symptomatic of why so many Canadians are saying that what they want to see, whether we are talking about a bill like this or any other government decision, is competence. They want to see a government that actually understands the impacts of what it is doing. They want to see a government that is not bringing forward 14 years of technical amendments, because it has been dropping the ball, systemically, for the last seven years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208266">In 2015, what Canadians will get is a government that is competent, an NDP government that will be submitting technical amendments on an annual basis, because that is what is right and proper for this House of Commons to consider.</ParaText>

Is there any way that we can hurry up the process of the government getting to the remaining 200 technical amendments?</ParaText>

There is no doubt that we want the government to get busy doing what it should be doing. We would welcome those kinds of amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208275">It has been said that if a Conservative managed a house there would be leaks in the roof, no shoes for the kids, the grandparents would not be able to buy their medication but there would be a nice shiny Ferrari out in the front yard. That is what we are seeing here. The government has been trying to systematically gut all of the protections that have been in place. We have seen a mess in EI. We have seen an elimination of environmental assessments for goodness' sake. We are seeing wide problems in terms of most Canadian families seeing their real income decline. Instead of tackling all of those things and tackling technical amendments, the government in a very mean-spirited way is proceeding with its own ideology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208276">Bringing forward amendments that would get the job done is what the NDP is all about. Of course we will be pushing those things forward because that is what New Democrats do in the House of Commons. That is why we have grown from 19 seats over there in the corner to 36 seats to now over 100 members of Parliament strong. In 2015 we will be 180 strong and we will be able to set right what the Conservatives have broken over the last few years.</ParaText>

It is obviously a very large bill. We are seeing that a lot in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208279">The NDP and many key players and experts in the fields of finance and accounting agree on that point. The majority of the changes in Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> will protect the integrity of the tax law in force. But we have been waiting a long time for these technical amendments to be introduced as part of a tax bill in the House. The most recent review of technical amendments happened in 2001. That was a long time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208280">There are amendments that date back to 1998, so this should have been ready a long time ago under the Liberal governments or under the current Conservative government. There is some reluctance to ensure that our tax laws are up-to-date. All Canadians should be wondering why it takes so long to get these things sorted out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208284">The Conservatives are always saying that the economy is their priority, but one has to wonder if that is really true when it takes them so long to respond to a request from the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada, a basic request that is good for our economy.

              <ParaText id="3208290">Unfortunately, I am not surprised that it has taken so long to put these changes into a bill, which does not even cover all the changes. The Conservatives talk about good management and accountability, but they never take appropriate action. It is truly unfortunate, because their talk could almost be taken for propaganda. They say that they are good managers of the economy, but we see that it is not true at all. It takes them a long time to do things that are very routine, that should be done every year. They are incapable of sound financial management. That is evident from the supplementary estimates. It is truly unfortunate that the Conservatives do not walk the talk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208291">The reality is that the Conservative government's inaction has resulted in a huge backlog. We now have a gigantic technical bill of almost 1,000 pages, and we have not even addressed half of the changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208292">We must use tax measures to combat tax avoidance and tax evasion and protect the integrity of our tax system at the same time. We support the changes in this bill, especially those that would curb tax avoidance. This is something the NDP has been focused on for a long time. However, the massive size of this bill shows that there is a lot of work to be done to turn these technical changes into legislative measures as quickly as possible. Otherwise, we are penalizing the business sector and making things difficult for Parliament. It is very complicated for Canadians when these measures are not included in a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208293">That is why, although we support the bill at second reading, we urge the government to do its homework, since Canadians should not have to wait a decade for the government to be accountable to Parliament by making tax amendments.

She mentioned in her speech how the Auditor General has called for these changes. She spoke about the Certified General Accountants of Canada who have called for the bill, have welcomed it, applauded it and in fact endorsed it. I am glad members on the other side are listening to that advice and will be supporting the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208302">I just want to clarify this for the purpose of debate. The bill was tabled in November. The minister and the department offered in-depth briefings to any member of the House with respect to any section of the bill. In fact, the committee will be starting a pre-study on the bill tomorrow morning. We would love to have the bill passed by this chamber. Perhaps the member would comment as to why, when the NDP is supporting the bill, it is putting up so many speakers here rather than allowing the bill to be sent to committee.</ParaText>

They have indicated the fact that it is time for Canada to get on with it and bring forward changes to our taxation laws, many of which have been practised informally but should be enshrined in legislation.

              <ParaText id="3208313">We note that this is an extremely lengthy bill, known as an omnibus bill. However, unlike the omnibus bills that the government has chosen to bring forward, this actually looks at an area of legislation rather than bringing everything in, including the kitchen sink. Not only that, the bill is focused on making technical changes and not the deep structural changes that we have seen time and time again from the government. If we are bringing in a bill that covers a lot of ground, it ought to be done in a specific manner, looking closely at related legislation like Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208314">The massive size of the bill demonstrates that there is still work to be done in getting such technical changes legislated in a timely fashion.

As a result, the Department of Finance Canada has a backlog of at least 400 technical amendments that have not been enacted, including 250 “comfort letters” dating back to 1998, recommending changes that have not been legislated.</QuotePara>

However, not unlike in other areas, we see that when it comes to moving forward in responding to the reality that Canadians face today, the government has been too slow to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208318">While informal arrangements have been made all along the way, Canadians would like to see a strong framework of legislation when it comes to taxation so we deal with them fairly, ensuring that people are not falling through the cracks and that taxes are not being avoided or evaded. Therefore, this is a perfect case of needing to listen to people like the former auditor general of Canada and many others who have indicated that it is time to move on and implement the kind of legislation we have before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208319">As well, this is more broadly about prioritizing the sense of fairness that Canadians ought to have when it comes to anything, even when we are talking about taxation. It is something that is at the core of our concept of citizenship and how we give back to society, how we give back to government, recognizing that Canadians do their part in working hard and returning back to the state part of their hard-earned money in order for us to have the kinds of programs, services and infrastructure that we all deserve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208320">Unfortunately, things are becoming more and more difficult for so many Canadians. This is in part because the social safety net that allows them to get out there and access gainful employment and make a dignified life for themselves is increasingly more challenging as the social safety net is weakened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208321">Just this week in the House, the NDP has raised a number of instances in which this is the case. Perhaps the best example is the weakening and the cuts to the employment insurance program. As we know, these changes will have a disproportionate negative impact on seasonal and cyclical workers. These are people who go out, do their jobs and support the economy in our regions all across the country. A good chunk of their money goes back into the coffers of the Canadian government to ensure we have the kinds of services on which we depend on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208322">Unfortunately, Canadians who are now being turned away from accessing employment insurance, who are being forced to move away, who are being forced to look at social assistance or welfare, will no longer be able to contribute to our system of taxation and return the kind of revenue that Canada depends on the way they used to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208323">Unfortunately, these changes will be felt first by the unemployed or by seasonal workers. Then those impacts will reverberate. They will reverberate once we start seeing communities suffer as a result of seasonal industries no longer being able to find people to work in them. Communities will suffer as we see the service and retail sectors not able to make a go of it because there is less income cycling through the community. We will also see communities and regions lose innovators and people who come to regions and benefit from the domino effect of many of these seasonal industries. That effect will snowball into an unfortunate situation where Canada will have less revenue coming back into its coffers from taxation to do the kind of work we need to do. Therefore, we will start seeing a weakening of essential services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208324">For the NDP, that is an unacceptable notion. After all, we as parliamentarians are here to guide Canada forward and to work with Canadians so we get better at who we are and so we can improve the standard of living that we all depend on. Unfortunately, the government has made some real structural changes and some severe cuts that will turn us back from the direction that we ought to take. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208325">Therefore, when we are talking about the issue of fairness, it goes back to a fundamental Canadian value, and that is we all work hard and we all want to be part of giving back to our society, our community and our family. However, we need to ensure there are structures in place, like proper and fair tax legislation, like social programs that allow our seasonal industries and our regions to continue to contribute to our economy and our wealth and to ensure Canadians have the kinds of things that have set us apart from the rest of the world, whether it is investment in health care, education, housing or infrastructure. These are the kinds of things we do not see from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208326"> I would note, particularly, that the legislation also refers to the First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act, again recognizing the issue of tax fairness when it comes to first nations people and recognizing treaty rights and the key role that first nations people have played in building the wealth of Canada and the need for the Government of Canada to be partners going forward when it comes to aboriginal people in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208327">There is a lot of work to do and I am proud to be part of a party, the NDP, that stands in the House every day and calls for fairness. Today, when we are showing our support for Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> and debating in the House, this is no exception.

              <ParaText id="3208331">Mr. Speaker, I can definitely say that our region, which does depend upon natural resources, has suffered as a result of recent government budgets. Our dependence on natural resources also means a dependence upon seasonal work, whether it is the forestry industry or development, including exploration. Cuts to EI certainly do not help our region, at all. It puts us back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208332">Another example where the government has failed our region is opening our region up to foreign investment without a clear indication of net benefit. The result is that the major mining company in our region has been bought by a Brazilian multinational, which has been slow to come to the table to find a solution for our community, after the Government of Canada sold us out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208333">Other examples are the continued failure for the government to invest in first nations infrastructure, meaning a massive portion of our region lives in third world conditions and is not able to access the kind of economic opportunities that exist in our region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208334">All in all, I am sad to say that the current Conservative federal government has certainly failed the people of northern Manitoba, and a lot of people across the north in general. We expect better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208335">Mr. Speaker, I think it is worth saying that there are numerous pages, in the hundreds, within this piece of legislation, and within those pages there are numerous amendments being suggested to our tax laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208336">Quite often when we are into the second reading, we want to talk about the broader principle of the legislation and then go into the committee where we have the opportunity to get into some of the line-by-line, clause-by-clause, analysis of what has been changed.</ParaText>

How important is it that we reflect on the different clauses and the impact they might have on our tax laws, believing that for the most part they are necessary changes, and that there could even be the possibility of new amendments because it has been a bit of time since it was drafted and brought into the chamber? I wonder if she would reflect on the possibility for amendments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208338">Mr. Speaker, there is no question that committee work is essential, in every way, particularly when we are talking about having to go through, in this case, very lengthy legislation, to ensure it is fair, timely, and that it deals with the kinds of loopholes and gaps that exist today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208339">What Canadians expect from parliamentarians is that due diligence will be given, whether it is in committee or in the House during debate. Unfortunately, what we have seen from the current government is a tendency to shut down debate and shut down opportunities to look closely at legislation coming forward. A great example is that the current government has brought in closure to critical debates in this House, I think almost 30 times.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208341">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to join this debate on Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208342">I hope to use what little time I have to expand on the broader issue of how governments generate revenue, and the role of parliamentarians in being charged with the responsibility of the scrutiny, oversight and due diligence associated with generating revenue through taxation, and then, of course, the spending of that revenue. I do not suppose there is anything more important that MPs do than that. It is certainly the primary function and why our constituents give us their confidence to supervise the public purse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208343">At the outset, I was pleased to see that Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> deals with tax avoidance and tax evasion as well as a number of intricacies in the tax system itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208344">Chartered accountants and virtually all of the tax lawyers and tax accountants advertise on their websites something called the “tax-motivated expatriation”. They call it that because it has a nicer ring than “sleazy tax-cheating loopholes”, which is what it is when tax avoidance and tax evasion allows one to be a tax fugitive by harbouring one's resources and taking advantage of what taxes buy in terms of a stable, safe community, with public services, policing and health care. It is putting one's money offshore to hide it from the prying eyes of the public and the taxman, and not paying one's fair share but getting the best of both worlds. I am glad that finally this Parliament is seized of the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208345">I was here years ago when the Liberals were in power. Ironically, they tore up a number of tax treaties with different tax havens. However, they left 11 in place, one of which, of course, was where the leader of the Liberal Party at the time, who became Prime Minister, had his 13 shadow company in tax havens, stashing his business away from the tax system, the very tax system that allowed him to live in a such a decent country. That kind of thing makes my blood boil. The tax-cheating loopholes through tax havens has always bothered me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208346">Another thing that has bugged me is that we focus so much on generating tax revenue, yet we overlook other obvious sources of bankrolling the social services we need. One that comes to mind is another Liberal invention, the corporate welfare program called “technology partnership loans”. Some who have been around here for a while will remember the TPLs, technology partnership loan system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208347">I did some research when we had been dealing with the paying back of student loans. During the estimates, we learned that the government had to write off $280 million, I think it was, in the supplementary estimates (C). However, 87% of all the money loaned in student loans is paid back, and 95% of all the individuals pay it back. The numbers are jigged because I guess some have larger loans, but 95% of all the people who borrow student loans pay back every penny they owe to that program. With the technology partnership loans under the Liberal government, it is entirely the opposite, with 5% being paid back and 95% outstanding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208348">When is a loan not a loan? Well, if one never pays it back, it is not a loan at all, but a gift, a handout. It is corporate welfare. It is dumping a wheelbarrow full of dough into somebody's business where one is obviously expecting some kind of a quid pro quo. Why we leave these outstanding technology partnership loans dangling there, I will never understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208349">The Canadian Taxpayers Federation just did a big report on this in its latest monthly magazine. Members can look it up to see exactly how much which companies borrowed, and how much, if any, they have paid back. It goes on page after page with these hugely profitable companies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208350">One of my complaints about across-the-board general tax cuts to business is simply this. Any kind of a tax cut to business should be tied to some kind of quid pro quo, a performance, a job creation, some benefit to the taxpayer other than just helping to subsidize the activities of that company, with the exception possibly of SMEs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208351">When the NDP government was elected in Manitoba, the small business tax rate was 11%. The Conservatives of the day were gouging small businesses mercilessly, to the point where they were staggering under the load. They were crippled by over-taxation in the province of Manitoba. When the NDP was elected, it systematically and annually reduced the small business tax as much as it could afford, 1% at a time. Every year it went down by 1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208352">Could you guess, Mr. Speaker, perhaps with hand signals, what you think the small business taxation rate in the socialist paradise of Manitoba is today? Are you willing to hazard a guess, sir? It is a great big goose egg: zero. The small business tax in Manitoba is zero because there is ample empirical evidence to show that when a tax break is given to small businesses, they hire people, expand their businesses, invest in their companies and generate wealth in the community. We know that every dollar spent in the community is spent at least four times before it finds its natural state of repose in some rich man's pocket, which he then invests offshore in a tax haven.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208353">The economic game is not supposed to be like some shady ring toss on a carnival midway. However, that is the way people feel sometimes when it is stacked so heavily against ordinary working people who are simply trying to earn a living, pay their taxes and get decent services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208354">I used one example with regard to the Liberal regime. I am a little hostile toward the Liberals right now; I was just having a fight with my colleague from Manitoba. I have to remind people that a lot of the time that I spent here was under a Liberal regime. The Liberals chose to balance the books by three things that are still timely and topical today. They cut $50 billion in social transfers to the provinces. That $50 billion gave them a start, cutting and hacking and slashing through every social program by which we define ourselves as Canadians, in the most ruthless and irresponsible way one can imagine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208355">Where do members think the Liberals got the second part? People forget there was a $40 billion surplus in the public pension plan and the final parting act by Marcel Masse, the Treasury Board president at the time, was to scoop every single penny out of the surplus of the public service pension plan and take it unto themselves. They were not allowed to, and they had to pass legislation to do it. That surplus should have at least been divided among the beneficiaries and contributors, but the Liberals scooped 100%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208356">Where did they get the third part for their budget balancing? They got it from the EI fund: $57 billion that was not theirs. They did not contribute a single penny to it. They scooped $57 billion out of the EI fund. Let me talk about the impact of the cuts to EI. They created a program where nobody qualified anymore, but everybody had to pay into it. An analysis was done, and their changes to EI in 1997 caused $20.8 million a year of federal money for my riding to be sucked right out of that riding, with all of the corresponding beneficial spending associated with that $20 million. It was like night and day. That is how to not balance a budget. We are talking about revenue, how to generate revenue and how governments get the money they need to provide the services they are obliged to provide. That is not something we want replicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208357">When we talk about taxation, we need to talk about the redistribution of wealth. It is one of the ways to redistribute the great wealth of a great nation so that we all enjoy the benefits of living in this society. We forget some of the big picture issues when we drill down and analyze these increasingly complex tax documents. If we are guided by the underlying motif that it is a way to fair taxes, leading to good public services, it is not something to be lamented, and tax avoidance by tax fugitives in sleazy tax-cheating loopholes is not to be tolerated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208362">Mr. Speaker, it is important to correct the record because this is some of the great revisionist history of the Liberal Party. The Liberals still cannot believe they were thrown out of power. They are still mourning from the traumatic event here.

We would have a national daycare system and we would have a Kelowna accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208363">However, in actual fact, every time the Liberals had a balanced budget and every time they did get a surplus, and there were seven or eight surpluses in a row, they gave it to their buddies on Bay Street in increasingly large corporate tax cuts. They were in a race with the Conservatives, a race to the bottom. They will not be happy until there are zero corporate taxes on the macro scale. Every single time they had an opportunity, instead of spending it on social programs and turning the tap back on that they had turned off to balance the budget, they chose to give it to their Bay Street buddies.

              <ParaText id="3208400">Small business entrepreneurs must develop their products and their markets. If they have to take one day a week, four days a month, to deal with their taxes, meet with their accountant and put things in the hands of someone they trust, that takes time. However, they do not have that kind of time because they are small business owners. They need all of their time to develop their products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208401">It is not difficult for large businesses. They deal with numerous accountants, finance experts and lawyers, all of whom are highly qualified. They work with people who are capable of helping them. Small businesses do not have the same means, and that hurts them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208406">Mr. Speaker, tax evasion is costing our economy hundreds of thousands of jobs. That money could be invested in our country and in our regions, which desperately need it, whether for small businesses or for environmental projects, in the manufacturing sector or in research and development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208407">Hundreds of millions of dollars lost to tax evasion could help Canadians, reduce unemployment in remote areas and help first nations populations.

              <ParaText id="3208411">Mr. Speaker, first, I want to say that we support Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> because it will have some positive effects on revenues, and the changes it makes will help deter tax avoidance, which is good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208412">I find it interesting that the bill talks a lot about tax avoidance. Members know that the middle class, which pays taxes, can rarely use tax avoidance tactics to pay less and have a little breathing room. The people who have the means to pay taxes also have the means to find ways to avoid them, while the middle class is suffocating under the weight of all of the government's cuts. I think it is good that this bill addresses the issue of tax avoidance. I wanted to share that with my colleagues. Our tax system must be managed much more responsibly, and we must ensure its integrity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208413">I have a question for the government. Why did it wait so long to legislate measures that have been around for 10 years? Some of these came into effect in 1998. I was 13 years old in 1998. That was a long time ago. The government opposite is not the only one to blame, because it has not been in power since 1998. Thank goodness, since who knows what the House would look like. I get the impression that they suddenly woke up and decided they needed to legislate some tax measures. I find that a little odd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208414">I do not claim to be a financial expert. I probably never will be. It is not a topic that interests me as much as housing, which I talk about all the time. I am no financial expert, but it seems to me that a competent government should have woken up a little sooner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208415">When I look at how long this document is, I pity the poor Standing Committee on Finance, which has to examine it. The word “omnibus” also comes to mind. I will certainly never approve of this way of doing things and neither will my party, obviously. The government has a tendency to put everything in one bill, and I do not agree with that practice. For example, Bill <Document DbId="5839600" Type="3">C-48</Document> amends the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act and the First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208416">Given the importance of these four laws, the length of the bill and the need for the measures set out in this bill, I am afraid that the committee will do a poor job of examining the bill, which would be too bad considering how important it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208417">Honestly, I find that this bill, which is coming from a government that claims to be so concerned about the health of our economy, is really late, and I think that it should be examined in a different manner. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> himself admitted that the government failed to take action. I would not like to be part of the Conservative cabinet right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208418">That being said, given the government's inaction on so many matters of vital importance to our country, I am not really surprised to see that it has been so negligent with regard to tax avoidance and the integrity of our tax system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208419">I am talking about inaction. I am talking about a government that does not understand the importance of homelessness and affordable housing programs, for example. I am talking about a botched EI reform at a time when workers need EI the most. I am talking about a government that barely makes any investments in the environment, thereby endangering the quality of life of future generations. I am talking about a government that neglects infrastructure to the point where I am now afraid to drive on the Champlain Bridge, and I believe that is a legitimate fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208420">When this bill is passed and tax avoidance is being discouraged, can we hope to see revenue increase?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208421">In my riding, there is a lack of affordable housing. Homelessness is on the rise and agricultural businesses are losing skilled employees because of the EI reform. What is more, many environmental organizations are fighting to give our children a habitable earth. Clearly, we also need health infrastructure, a commuter train and a tunnel in order to promote the economic development of our region. Once this measure is implemented, will others follow?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208444">While it is not usual for the Chair to provide reasons for the selection of report stage motions, in this case, I have decided to do so, as I have received a written submission from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> outlining what he feels are exceptional circumstances surrounding the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill in committee.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208445">As members know, consistent with the note to Standing Order 76.1(5), the Chair would not normally select motions that could have been presented in committee.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208446">The hon. member who has submitted motions at report stage was also an active participant in the meeting scheduled for the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. As such, it would appear that the amendments submitted by the member could have been proposed during the committee consideration of the bill. In the present case, however, there appear to be extenuating circumstances.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208447">In his remarks, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> explained that during clause-by-clause consideration of the bill on December 6, 2012, the committee passed two amendments to the first clause of the text as well as the clause itself, as amended. He stated that the committee did not continue studying the bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208448">Even the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>'s attempt to seek a 30-day extension for the consideration of Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> in committee was unsuccessful. As a result, clause-by-clause consideration of the bill did not proceed beyond the first clause, and pursuant to Standing Order 97.1, on December 10, 2012, the bill was deemed reported back to the House without amendment.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208449">The Chair has had to rule on similar cases in the past, including one that came up on December 7, 2012—at page 13030 of  <I>House of Commons Debates</I>—regarding Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (requirements for labour organizations)</Document>. In that case, due to circumstances beyond its control, the committee was unable to complete its examination before the bill was deemed to have been reported without amendment pursuant to Standing Order 97.1. Accordingly, any amendments that had originally been submitted for the clause-by-clause examination of the bill in committee were submitted again at report stage. The Chair therefore selected those motions at report stage for debate, because it was clear that the members in question had attempted to propose their amendments in committee during the clause-by-clause examination of the bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="3208450">In reviewing the sequence of events related to the bill now before the House, as well as the written submission from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, I am satisfied that despite the efforts of the member to have his amendments considered by the committee, he was unable to do so before the bill was deemed reported back to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208451">Accordingly, Motions Nos. 1 to 9 have been selected for debate at report stage, and they will be grouped for debate and voted upon, according to the voting patterns available at the table.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208485">He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased with the ruling that we just heard that allows these amendments to be considered by the full House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208486">There was a minority in the committee, some of whom we will hear from later on in this debate, who chose to try to shut down the full consideration of the compromise that was reached through intensive discussion among members of all parties in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208487">When this bill was approved at second reading, it was done so with the support of members from all parties, but some had concerns about the bill. Therefore, the promise that I made at second reading was to have talks in good faith among all parties to try to find a bill that could achieve the support of this full House. If these amendments are approved, I believe we will now have that bill in front of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208488">As we have just heard, the package of amendments is quite complex, but it really only does two things. Nine amendments are required because of the complexity of legal drafting, but again, only two things are happening here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208489">The first is that the bill adds the definition of “gender identity”, which we just heard the Speaker read out in the House. The second is that the term “gender expression” is removed from the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208490">I hope this reassures those members who wanted a somewhat narrower bill, a bill that was somewhat easier to explain in public, and a bill that might rule out some of the more extreme concerns or fears that some people had. I believe that if we approve these amendments, we will have that bill in front of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208491">There were some concerns about “gender expression” being less well defined in law and that this would somehow open the gates to abusive practices on the basis of the gender identity bill. I will be very frank and talk about the main one of those, which was the concern that somehow people could use this bill to gain illegitimate access to public bathrooms and change rooms in order to commit what would always be criminal acts of assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208492">I contacted the jurisdictions in the United States that have had these provisions in place for a very long time. Four of those did reply, those being California, Iowa, Colorado and the state of Washington. All of them reported the same thing: there have been no instances in any of those states of attempts to use the protections for transgendered people for illegal or illegitimate purposes—no incidents, zero, none.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208493">There have been concerns on the other side from members of the transgendered community or those who have gender variant expressions that they wish to carry out. To them I would say that this is a somewhat narrower bill, but we believe that it preserves the essence of the protections we are seeking here, which is that transgendered and gender variant persons should have the same rights as all other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208494">If these amendments are adopted, it would be a somewhat narrower bill than that passed by the previous Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208495">I have to take a moment to pay tribute to former MP Bill Siksay, who brought that bill forward through the minority Parliament. However, the bill died on the order paper of the Senate as a result of an election call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208496">If we approve these amendments and we go on to adopt this bill, what is it that we would actually be doing here? I am arguing that we are simply completing the Canadian human rights agenda. This bill would create no special rights, no additional rights and no unusual rights, but would simply provide the same rights, no more and no less, to transgendered and gender variant Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208497">Another argument against the bill has been that it is not necessary to have it, that somehow people are already protected in Canada. I have a legal answer to that, and then I have a practical answer to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208498">The legal answer is that we heard from the Canadian Human Rights Commission in committee that it would be very useful to clarify the law by having this explicit mention of transgendered rights in the Canadian Human Rights Act and in the hate crime section of the Criminal Code. It is true that in the past the Human Rights Commission and the tribunal have decided cases involving transgendered Canadians on the basis of sex discrimination; however, as they have pointed out, that is no guarantee that all future cases would meet the test of sex discrimination. Therefore, in order to make sure that all the possible issues that might arise are covered, it would be better to have an explicit statement in both the Canadian Human Rights Act and in the hate crime section of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208499">On a practical basis, I find it hard to question the necessity of this bill. Transgendered Canadians are the most discriminated against. There was a study in Ontario which found discrimination in employment to be a severe problem and the rate of unemployment for transgendered Ontarians was 2.5 times higher the rate for all other Ontarians. As well, transgendered Ontarians found themselves concentrated in the very lowest paying jobs, with over 70% of them earning less than $30,000 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208500">In Canada the rate of hate crimes against transgendered Canadians is very high, but even more shocking is the fact that transgendered Canadians are the group most likely to suffer hate crimes involving violence. Therefore, if I am asked on a practical basis if the bill is necessary, I believe it is necessary to end this discrimination and to ensure that transgendered Canadians enjoy the same protections that the rest of us expect in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208501">If we adopt the amendments and pass the bill, it will make a statement about Canadian values. We all like to believe we are a country where everyone is equal, treated fairly and where no one is left behind. However, we clearly have a case with transgendered and gender varied Canadians for whom that is not true. A public declaration by the House and eventually, I hope, by the Senate, will be a very strong statement to all of Canadian society that this kind of discrimination has to end and that transgendered Canadians have to take their place in Canadian society on the same basis as all other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208502">It would mean we could draw on the talents of all of our citizens. We cannot do that when people are economically disadvantaged. We cannot do that when they are afraid to appear in public because of discrimination or violence. We cannot draw on all the many talents they have. Certainly, we would be a stronger, more vibrant nation when we draw on the talents, imagination and abilities of all of our citizens without discrimination against any group. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208503">We know that legislation alone will not be a panacea. We know much work will have to be done if this legislation is approved. However, we have seen the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba adopt similar legislation. It has been in place in the Northwest Territories for a very long time. It is under active consideration now in the province of Nova Scotia and I know that there are talks going on in other provinces about introducing the same kind of legislation into provincial human rights codes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208504">By approving these amendments and this bill at the national level, we will place ourselves in the wave of change that is sweeping across the country to eliminate one of the last vestiges of legal discrimination and violence against members in our community. I look forward to a Canada where all can participate fully in public life, a Canada where we draw on the best of all of our citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208505">I hope this compromise we reach through negotiation will stand through this debate and hold when we come to vote and that we can join hands with some from the other side and with the Liberals, Greens, the Bloc and those who supported second reading and send this bill to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208506">I am hopeful, with some discussions I have had with senators, that it will receive fair consideration there because this will be the second time this kind of bill has passed through the House of Commons. That is a very strong statement. I remain very optimistic that we can demonstrate we can reach across the aisle, work together, reach a compromise and do something for the good of all of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208507">I know many members of the transgendered community, some who are present here this evening and some who are listening to this debate as it takes place in the House. I am very proud of the work they have done to help move the bill forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208508">It is not just from those of us who have the privilege of standing in Parliament, but there has been a lobbying effort across the country. Many transgendered Canadians, many for the first time, contacted their MPs, sat down with them and said that they were part of the community they represented. They asked their MPs to support them when the bill came forward in the House of Commons. I salute the many transgendered Canadians, both individuals and organizations, who participated in the lobbying efforts to get the bill through the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208509"> I want to reiterate what a pleasure it has been working with members in all parties to try to come to an agreement which will help advance the human rights agenda in our country to help ensure that transgendered and gender varied Canadians enjoy the same rights that the rest of us do in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3208510">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to comment on and contribute to the debate on Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document>, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (gender identity and gender expression).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208511">Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> has been studied by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. While at committee, the sponsor of Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, proposed several amendments. He proposed to add only the term “gender identity” and not “gender expression” as a prohibited ground in the Canadian Human Rights Act and to the hate propaganda and aggravated sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code. He also proposed to add a definition of the term “gender identity” to the bill's preamble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208512">I would like to begin with a discussion of the proposed amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act. In interpreting and applying this act, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has already accepted and considered several complaints brought by transsexuals on the ground of sex. In fact, the ground of sex in any discrimination law is interpreted broadly and has evolved over the years. It is usually understood to cover discrimination complaints based not just on sex, but also gender-related attributes, such as pregnancy, childbirth, and more recently, transsexualism. For those complaints brought by transsexuals, the tribunal has used the existing grounds already contained in the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208513">I would like to give a few examples to illustrate my point. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decided one case involving a male-to-female transsexual who was incarcerated in a federal men's prison. This inmate brought a complaint before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal alleging discrimination because the prison refused to continue her sex reassignment treatments and did not want to transfer her to a women's prison. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208514">The tribunal dealt with this complaint under the ground of sex. In its decision, the tribunal stated, and I am quoting directly from the 2001 judgment of Kavanagh v. Correctional Services of Canada, which says there is no dispute “that discrimination on the basis of Transsexualism constitutes sex discrimination as well as discrimination on the basis of a disability”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208515">In another decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, from 2004, Montreuil v. National Bank of Canada, a male-to-female transsexual, who was in the process of transitioning and was dressing in women's clothing, was refused employment at a bank. Here again, the tribunal dealt with this complaint using the ground of sex, as the parties agreed. The tribunal member commented that “as a pre-operative transgendered person, the Complainant belonged to the group of persons who cannot be discriminated against on the basis of sex, under the Act”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208516">In a 2009 decision from the tribunal involving the same complainant, the Canadian Forces had refused the complainant's application for enrolment in the forces after determining that she had gender identity disorder. While the complaint was eventually dismissed by the tribunal, the tribunal member stated quite plainly that “discrimination on the basis of transsexualism is discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, as well as discrimination on the basis of disability”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208517">In deciding that transsexuals are already protected by our federal human rights law, the tribunal's approach is consistent with that taken by the provincial human rights tribunals that have found discrimination against transsexuals to be covered by the existing ground of sex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208518">I will mention one more decision to make my point that discrimination against transsexuals can and already has been addressed by the current law. This example comes from a discrimination complaint that made its way to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. In this case, a male-to-female transsexual was refused a volunteer position at a women's shelter and rape crisis centre. Once again, the tribunal dealt with the complaint using the ground of sex, and the Court of Appeal accepted this. This is the Vancouver Rape Relief Society v. Nixon case, which was decided in 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208519">As I have just described, all of these cases were dealt with using the ground of sex. This makes sense, as the existing prohibited grounds of discrimination are subject to interpretation by the tribunals and the courts. The ground of sex has been interpreted broadly, as I mentioned earlier, which is in keeping with how human rights protections are generally interpreted by courts and tribunals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208520">Using all of these examples, I wish to make the point that transsexuals facing discrimination in federally regulated workplaces and in accessing federally regulated services are in fact already protected by the current law.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208521">For similar reasons, we may wish to ask ourselves whether it is necessary to add these grounds to the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code. The section in question lists a number of deemed aggravating circumstances on sentencing, including evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability or any other similar factor. Again, the list includes sex, and it also refers to any other similar factor. Consequently, judges may already be able to impose longer sentences for hate crimes against transsexual persons in appropriate circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208522">If transsexuals are already protected from discrimination and are covered by the open-ended language of the sentencing provisions, we must ask ourselves this. What is the purpose of adding these terms? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208523">It may be a largely symbolic or declarative purpose. In that case, on what basis do we decide to symbolically add one group and not others? Grounds of discrimination are not typically stated generally, like sex, race and religion. There are many different groups covered by these grounds. The Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code do not break these grounds into specific groups, which would involve selecting some groups over others for specific mention. If it turns out that, for example, people are being discriminated against on the basis of certain religious observance, then the general ground of religion is there to cover the situation. It would be inappropriate for Parliament to extend the list of grounds by adding particular religious observance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208524">If people with a particular disability are facing discrimination, then the ground of disability is in the act and can be used to protect these individuals. If we began to add specific groups, there might be no end to this kind of law reform and it could go on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208525">As I have said, the ground of sex is already in the act and has been used to address instances of discrimination against this group. The addition of gender identity is therefore unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208526">However, if its addition is not purely symbolic, as the sponsor tells us it is not, then we would ask ourselves this. If this ground were to be added to the Canadian Human Rights Act, what sorts of new complaints of discrimination will be brought before the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Tribunal? How will employers know what kinds of workplace behaviour and expression would be prohibited? The answers to these questions are not clear to me and they are questions that we should carefully consider. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208527">As I have explained, I believe the amendments proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> are unnecessary. For these reasons, I will be opposing Bill C-279.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3208528">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (gender identity and gender expression)</Document> to protect transgender Canadians. In its original form, it did this by adding “gender identity” and “gender expression” to both statutes. As I stated the last time the bill was in the House, I support this important effort, which will have not only symbolic but substantive and practical effects, to provide human rights protections to groups that, for example, the Ontario Human Rights Commission has characterized as being as “disadvantaged and disenfranchised” as any in our society today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208529">We are presented now with the unusual yet welcome opportunity to reconsider amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> that were raised at committee. These amendments, which remove “gender expression” and add an agreed upon definition of “gender identity”, were the product of a compromise solution, agreed to to maintain the support of the 15 Conservatives who joined with the opposition and voted for the bill at second reading. While I had hoped that both “gender identity” and “gender expression” would remain included in the bill, I appreciate the need for compromise in order to make progress on this critical issue. On that note, I would like to commend the sponsor of this legislation, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, for the spirit of co-operation he has maintained throughout this process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208530">With respect to the amendments that add a definition of gender identity, I welcome the fact that the chosen definition makes explicit reference to the internationally recognized Yogyakarta Principles. While these principles are not themselves binding international law, they were developed by some of the world's foremost experts on international human rights law and are intended to serve as an interpretive aid to human rights treaties. As an international law scholar myself, I am always pleased to see us referencing elements of internationally recognized principles in our own domestic legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208531">As I mentioned with respect to the exclusion of “gender expression”, it was initially my preference that both terms remain in the bill. Again, I am cognizant of the possibility that even in the absence of “gender expression”, the term “gender identity” might, through case law and through an appreciation of travaux préparatoires, eventually come to encompass part or all that would have been protected by the former.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208532">All things considered, the amendments in question today are reasonable given that Parliament would still be taking a significant step forward with respect to protecting the rights of transgendered Canadians. As of now, these individuals can only exercise their rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act by advancing a claim under the prohibited grounds of sex and/or disability, as the parliamentary secretary himself acknowledged. To be clear, tribunals do hear the cases of transgendered Canadians, but such claims are complex and costly and rely on grounds, such as in the case of disability, that may themselves be highly offensive to the claimants themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208533">Some might ask why this is necessary legislation if transgendered individuals already benefit from such protections, which is basically the query and complaint put forward by the parliamentary secretary. Besides the symbolic value of recognizing this group in statute, Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> produces three substantive and practical effects of note. First, the Canadian Human Rights Commission would begin keeping statistics on incidents of discrimination targeting transgendered individuals. Second, the commission would begin raising awareness of transgender issues in its communications. Third, public officials would begin receiving briefings and training on the matter. This is, of course, in addition to the most important change offered by the bill, the offer of a clear and explicit human rights recourse to transgendered Canadians, not only in that it provides an expressed protection for transgendered people but in that it provides an effective remedy. This is something that cannot be marginalized or ignored. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208534">There is precedent for the use of the term “gender identity” in Canadian, provincial as well as international contexts, notably the United Nations declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, which Canada signed in 2008 and what I mentioned earlier, the internationally recognized Yogyakarta Principles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208535">In a word, I believe that this legislation would better ensure that transgendered Canadians enjoy the same equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination as all other Canadians, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> has so aptly affirmed and demonstrated in his remarks and in his work throughout this process.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208536">However, it bears pointing out that we are in this rare situation today of reconsidering amendments because Conservatives on the justice committee engaged in a concerted and regrettable effort to thwart debate at the clause-by-clause stage. Indeed, the intention was clearly either to obfuscate the subject and spirit of the bill or, if nothing else, to torpedo the compromise arranged by the mover. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208537">To start, they came with their own amendments, including a handful that only reinforced the status quo formula of “sex” and “disability”. Then there was a frivolous amendment exempting official Canadian sports authorities from the provisions of the bill, as if to contain some fictional mass of men trying to compete in women's sports, and vice versa. Finally, there was an out-of-context amendment that sought to ensure that no part of the Canadian Human Rights Act could infringe upon the rights of aboriginal peoples. While I firmly believe that we should only enact legislation that is mindful of the rights of Canada's aboriginal peoples, I found there was no reason to codify this specific protection into the act, as the charter supersedes any statutory act, which is clearly set forth in section 52 of the Constitution Act. It appeared that this, too, was a diversionary item.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208538">Despite the tactics of diversion and delay, the compromise could still have been implemented at committee. With the support of one of the 15 Conservatives who voted for the bill at second reading, whom we should credit for open-mindedness, the committee accepted the amendment we are reconsidering today to remove “gender expression”, rendering several other Conservative alternatives inadmissible. Unfortunately, this procedural oversight by the Conservatives who were opposed to the bill spurred them to engage in a filibuster, behaviour which the Speaker has obviously himself acknowledged, given his decision today. Hopefully, we can now conclude the amendment process with an honest debate on the merits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208539">I would like to once again remind members of what is at stake with regard to this bill. To quote Mr. Justice La Forest of the Supreme Court of Canada at the time, “gender identity” must be included as a protected ground in the Canadian Human Rights Act because, “To leave the law as it stands would fail to acknowledge the situation of transgendered individuals and allow the issues to remain invisible”. We should also not disregard the history associated with this legislation, which has been introduced seven times since 2005. It was most notably passed by the House in early 2011, only to die on the Senate floor following the dissolution of Parliament that same year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208540">Today I urge my colleagues to not let this be another failed attempt at establishing equality and fairness for transgendered Canadians. The time to act is now.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="3208541">Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure tonight to rise and show my very strong support for Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (gender identity and gender expression)</Document>. I will speak to the amendments as well as the general bill in my speech tonight and the shorter form as it is often called, “the gender identity bill”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208542">It seems very apt to be speaking to the bill this evening, on the very day that tens of thousands of people across Canada are joining together to reduce bullying. We have had the famous Pink Shirt Day today, when people from all communities across Canada are joining hands and saying that this is something we must reduce, that it is something that is taking a terrible toll on our neighbourhoods and in our communities where we live and we have to do something to stop that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208543"> With this bill, we are talking about making the world a better place by taking steps to protect those whom others abuse. The bill has been a long time coming but it is well worth supporting, especially with the amendments have proposed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208544">I am disappointed that some members on the other side are opposing the bill, as stated tonight, and I think we will hear it in other speeches. Their statements somewhat misrepresent the views of a number of members within the Conservative caucus, including the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> who voted to support the bill at second reading. Where their arguments are often being masked in technical details, I think there are deeper and more disturbing reasons for not supporting the bill that underlie their objections. Again, I do not think this represents a good number of the Conservative caucus who have supported it at second reading and in the past as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208545">The bill has been introduced and championed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, whom I have the great pleasure of sitting beside in the House of Commons. Even though the member is newly elected, like me a rookie, the bill has shown that he is one of the smartest and most ethical MPs in this place. I have enormous respect for his work on it and also as our very able public safety critic. I am very honoured to support his heroic efforts to support the trans community and those within the LGBTQ community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208546">Besides sitting beside the champion of the bill, I have another strong connection with the bill other than my absolute belief that it is relevant and just in that earlier versions were championed by my predecessor in Burnaby—Douglas, Mr. Bill Siksay. It is really an honour to follow in the footsteps of Mr. Siksay. Through his efforts on this issue and many others, he is seen as a champion in Burnaby and the national and international LGBTQ community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208547"> Bill Siksay first introduced the ideas contained in the bill in 2005, then again in 2006 and again in 2008. Members in the House may remember that predecessors to the bill passed through the last minority Parliament on February 11, 2011. Again, the bill has a long history. For eight years it has been winding through the House in various forms, having passed once and I hope pass again as it has passed second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208548"> In 2011 the bill had the full support of the NDP as well as some level of support from all other parties. Unfortunately, the bill in the last Parliament died in the Senate without being considered once the election was called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208549">This hopefully amended Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> contains some simple and very just measures. As my colleagues have mentioned, it would add the term “gender identity” to the Canadian Human Rights Act, section 2 as prohibited grounds for discrimination. It would also amend the Criminal Code to include gender identity as a distinguishing characteristic protected under section 318 and as an aggravating circumstance to be taken into consideration under section 718.2 at the time of sentencing. This would mean that it would count as a hate crime, or consideration when prosecuting hate crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208550"> Members again should remember that the bill passed second reading on June 6, 2012, with the unanimous consent of the NDP and support from Liberal, Bloc, Green and 15 Conservative MPs. I remind members who make speeches tonight that there is sizable support for it from a good portion of the Conservative caucus, including many frontbenchers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208551">I would like to thank those who supported the bill at second reading. It sends the right message to Canadians that the House of Commons takes care to ensure that justice extends to all Canadians. It is a good symbol and shows that we in the House of Commons care about this community and all communities in Canada and will make sure they are treated fairly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208552">These, of course, are in no way special rights. They are equal rights and they are ensuring that rights are being extended to all Canadians by enshrining the idea of gender identity in the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208553">Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> provides remedy to transsexual and transgender Canadians who do not currently enjoy specific protections in federal law or specific protection against hate crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208554">Passing the bill into law would be an important step forward for Canadians expressing themselves as transgendered. Trans people have regularly been shown that they are denied things that we all take for granted, such as adequate access to health care and housing, the ability to obtain or change identification documents, access to washrooms and other gender stations, as well as very fundamental rights such as the ability to exercise the right to vote and to acquire and maintain meaningful employment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208555">I would also remind members that Canada is a signatory to the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, and to meet our obligations it is necessary to add gender identity to our own Canadian Human Rights Act. Not only has this bill been winding its way through the House of Commons for a long time, but we also have an obligation not only to our citizens but to an international obligation to make sure we go forward with this measure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208556">The bill has had broad support from many across Canada. We have had emails, texts and twitters. I know people are following on CPAC and here in the House tonight, as well as many of our brothers and sisters in labour unions such as the CLC, CUPE, CUPW, CAW, CAUT and the British Columbia Teachers' Federation. It also has broad support from student groups across the country, including UVic Pride, UBC, York University, SFU and universities right across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208557">We need to do this in the spirit of the anti-bullying pink shirt day that we are seeing here in Canada. Wearing a pink shirt is a good thing. It shows that Canadians care. However, this is an opportunity to actually do something concrete, to change the laws of our country to make sure that people who are facing discrimination are no longer discriminated against, or if they are, that they have remedy within our legal system, whether it is the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Criminal Code, in order to make sure that they obtain justice and are able to pursue their lives as they see fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208558">What we need to take into account also is how the trans community is suffering under the current circumstances. Worldwide since 1970, 717 trans people have been reported as murdered. However, this of course is a severe undercount, because many countries do not collect adequate statistics in this area, nor do they correctly record violence against the trans community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208559">Finally, as we are here on pink shirt anti-bullying day, we should follow what Egale Canada says: that 90% of trans-identified students reported being bullied on a daily or weekly basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208560">I am proud to stand up here today to support the amendments and the bill and to make sure this bullying and this injustice stop and the trans community is given proper remedies to fight back against this discrimination. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208564">Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> has been studied by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. While the bill was in clause-by-clause review before the committee, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> proposed several amendments to the bill, namely that only the term “gender identity” but not “gender expression” be added as a prohibited ground in the Canadian Human Rights Act and to the hate propaganda and aggravated sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208565">The member also proposed to add a definition of the term “gender identity” to the preamble of Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document>. This definition reads:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208567">We do know that in practice the definition of “gender identity” in this discussion can extend beyond that. However, I also accept that clarifying the definition from a legal perspective is a challenging one. In some respects, that is one of the cruxes in this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208568">As I mentioned, the sponsor proposed to add this definition to the preamble of Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> although not to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Criminal Code directly. Looking at this definition as it stands, we can conclude that gender identity is something that all people must have. All Canadians must have some sense of their gender, of whether they are male or female. Indeed, the sponsor of Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> made this very point when he spoke before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208569">I raise this point because gender discrimination is already covered by existing law. In fact, there have been a number of decisions of the federal Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in which discrimination against transsexuals has already been considered using the ground of sex as defined and already included in the Canadian Human Rights Act. Some decisions have also used the ground of disability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208570">For example, a transsexual who was incarcerated in a men's prison brought a complaint forward to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, alleging discrimination because the prison refused to continue her sex reassignment treatments and did not transfer her to a women's prison. The tribunal dealt with this complaint under the ground of sex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208571">In another case, a male to female transsexual who was in the process of transitioning and was dressed in women's clothing was refused employment at a bank. Here again the tribunal dealt with this complaint using the ground of sex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208572">Finally, in a complaint from my home province that made its way up to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, a male to female transsexual was refused a volunteer position at a women's shelter and rape crisis centre. Again, the court dealt with the complaint using the ground of sex.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208573">All of these discrimination complaints have already been addressed under the current law. As a result, I question the legal need for the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208574">I also have some concerns on the proposed amendments to the Criminal Code. What kinds of speech based on someone's subjective or personal sense of being male or female would be considered hate propaganda? What does it mean to have a bias based on a person's subjective sense of being male or female? How do we single out one gender from the other?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208575">By adding the proposed definition for the term “gender identity” in Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279's</Document> preamble, it remains unclear what situations it would cover and how the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, or the criminal courts and the sentencing judges, would interpret these terms. This gives rise to the potential for subjective interpretations. These interpretations do not provide clarity nor certainty. In the absence of having greater certainty and a clear definition, it is important to recognize that existing laws already do apply to discrimination against transsexuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208576">I respect what the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> is attempting to do in the bill. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, and our criminal courts and sentencing judges do not have that same luxury. They are bound to follow the language that is passed into law. If that language is too vague, then it becomes open to selective and arbitrary interpretation. This is contrary to the clarity that we seek to create in our laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208577">While I do respect the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca's</Affiliation> efforts and that the language as proposed in the bill is well intended, I submit it would not provide the clarity that is needed, and as such I regret that I cannot support Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208578">In closing, I explained that the amendments proposed in this bill were largely unnecessary given the existing case law. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has already dealt with a number of discrimination complaints lodged by transsexual individuals. It is not necessary to add vague new terms to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the Criminal Code. That is why I urge my colleagues from all parties to vote against this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208582">This recognition for transgendered and transsexual people is not just symbolic; it is urgently needed. My NDP colleagues have provided many reasons for this urgency over the course of the debates in the House, since Bill Siksay introduced the first version of the bill in 2005.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208583">It is urgent because transgender people are victims of violence and discrimination, and live in greater poverty. It is urgent because it is vital that transgender people be recognized as individuals in their own right with all the rights to which they are entitled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208584">In this House, we should not be afraid to recognize transsexuals, transgender people and intersex people as Canadians in their own right who deserve to have their identity included in Canadian law. We must recognize the fact that gender and sexuality are distinct. They are not a simple dichotomy. The lack of binary simplicity is uncomfortable for people who accept their gender identity as a biological imperative. But that in no way reflects reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208585">The medical community is beginning to understand transgender identity and, step by step, is moving towards validating and supporting these facts.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Last year when Bill C-389 passed its third reading in the House of Commons, many questioned the wisdom of enshrining “gender identity” or “gender expression” in the Canadian Human Rights Act and whether this was redundant given that “sex” is already protected. With the NDP's Private Member Bill on Gender Identity now up for debate, these questions are once again being raised. As a paediatrician who cares for gender non-conforming children, adolescents and their families who are part of the roughly 1-2% of all Canadians with differences in their gender expression, I would like to highlight the main reasons why this issue is crucial for Canadian society.</QuotePara>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">While “gender identity” and “sex” are related terms, they are no synonymous. The most obvious example of this dichotomy is in children born with medical intersex conditions who identify more with one gender of another, or rarely, neither or both; but their physical sexual characteristics frequently do not correspond with their identity. Are we to conclude, then, that they fall outside the protection of the Human Rights Act because their “sex” is indeterminate or incongruent with their behaviour? Youth with any variation in their gender identity...have been shown, in numerous studies and in various clinical databases, to be the group most vulnerable to extreme and violent bullying, depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.</QuotePara>

They are also the most likely to be rejected by peers and family members, and often lacking even any legal recourse to simply “be” who they are, frequently enter a spiral of self-harm that can lead to substance abuse and alcoholism. This heartbreaking distress is seen and reported even in children as young as 4 years old who simply recognize that their gender identity does not correspond with their anatomic sex, and have asked their parents to help them die. So many families of gender variant kids experience severe discrimination, societal rejection, and serious psycho-social difficulty. This translates to higher levels of divorce, greater school and emotional problems in siblings, and severe marginalization. These families need their children to be recognized, included and protected, just as any family does.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="3208594">Dr. Gosh sees firsthand every day how children suffer from the pressure to normalize and how space must open in our culture and in our minds to account for gender non-conforming children. Some children have biological gender variance, but nowhere do they see powerful reflections of themselves in mainstream society. However, a person must be recognized and must see themselves reflected in the world around them to feel healthy and accepted, and we as legislators have to make laws that recognize their inherent human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208595">Not only do we have the power to better protect trans folk from the disproportionate harm they face, but I believe we can be even more proactive about this problem. This bill is a very good first step, and I want to thank my colleague for all the work he has done for it to have the possibility of becoming law. It is my hope, though, that we can do even more to break down the inherent discrimination in our society. There are so many spaces that define and treat us by gender, spaces where trans folk face non-inclusion, discrimination and harm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208596">We must proactively train police, airport officials, teachers, legal personnel and medical personnel, and raise awareness among all Canadians that gender non-conforming people are equal members of our communities who deserve to be respected, treated with dignity and cannot be discriminated against, just the same as those of us who conform to our birth sex as our identity. This is about people whose rights are being ignored due to who they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208597">In closing, I want to thank those who work on ensuring the rights and dignities of transgender and transsexual people, like Dr. Gosh and others I have heard from. Gwen Haworth, a trans woman, filmmaker and activist took the time to meet with me in Vancouver and to advocate for the rights of the trans youth she works with in the downtown eastside.

              <ParaText id="3208599">Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be able to join the debate today on Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (gender identity and gender expression)</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208600">As my colleagues are aware, Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> would amend both the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act by adding gender identity and gender expression. I understand that the member opposite now wants to change that with his amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208601"> I am cognizant of the need to protect all Canadians from discrimination and hate crimes. I am proud of the fact that Canada is recognized internationally as a country that is deeply committed to the principles of respect for diversity and equality, but I would argue that the bill accomplishes neither of those goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208602">The desperate attempt, I would say, by member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> to amend the bill shows that the bill itself is not adequate. The bill is just not up to the level it needs to be in order for anyone to support it in this House. The amendments to the act as proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> are largely symbolic and vague, and I would say that they risk introducing confusion to the law. I would suggest as well that the amendments he is making do not add anything to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208603">The bill is not properly designed to remedy the supposed social problem that it is aimed at addressing, and I would argue that it is largely unnecessary as well. For those reasons and a couple of others, I will be opposing Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208604">I first want to speak about the fact the bill is unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208605">The courts and human rights tribunals in this country have already developed jurisprudence to protect transsexual and transgendered people. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has already decided several complaints brought to it, and we heard about those earlier from my two colleagues. These complaints have been dealt with using the grounds of sex orientation or disability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208606">In fact, the grounds of sex in all anti-discrimination laws are interpreted broadly. They have evolved over the years and are usually understood to cover discrimination complaints based on not just sex but on all gender-related attributes, such as pregnancy, childbirth and, recently, transsexualism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208607">For those few complaints that have been brought by transsexuals—and I think one of my colleagues read four of them—the tribunal has used the existing grounds already contained in the Canadian Human Rights Act, and in fact there is no gap in protection. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has dealt with the four cases that were mentioned around gender identity and gender expression issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208608">Furthermore, in deciding that transsexuals are already protected by federal human rights laws, the tribunal's approach has been consistent with that taken by provincial human rights tribunals as well. They have found that these grounds of discrimination are already covered by their existing codes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208609">All of these cases were adjudicated within the framework of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which designates sex and sexual orientation as prohibited grounds of discrimination. Both Susheel Gupta, as the acting chairperson and chief executive officer of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, and Ian Fine, who is the secretary general of the CHRC, spoke at committee about that and the fact that it does not need to be extended further than it is now in order to deal with those complaints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208610">My second problem with the bill is that it is undefined. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208611">I understand that the member is now starting to try to put definition into some of these things because he is afraid he is going to lose the bill, and I think that he should lose it. Expanding the definition of sexual orientation to gender expression and to gender identity in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code makes who and what is being protected even less clear than it is. If the member's purpose was to clarify the existing grounds, which I would maintain is unnecessary, he could have proposed adding an appropriate definition to the Canadian Human Rights Act. He did not do that. He has come back lately with an attempt to do that, but it was not his intention at the beginning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208612">In fact, the member's intention at the beginning was that the courts and the human rights commissions themselves would determine the definitions of these things. He was quoted in <I>Xtra</I> magazine as saying: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208613">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Once gender identity is in the human rights code, the courts and human rights commissions will interpret what that means.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208614">I would suggest that even with the definition he is trying to add today, he probably is still thinking that hopefully the courts and the human rights commissions will define it. However, I would argue that it is inadequate for a legislator to proceed in this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208615">If our role is to bring laws forward, they should be brought forward with enough content that the courts and commissions are not the ones who are defining what those bills are and what they say. I believe that is inappropriate. It is an abdication of our parliamentary responsibility to pass laws that would leave us in a situation like that. For parliamentarians to leave new and undefined terms to the courts and human rights tribunals, I would argue, is risky and irresponsible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208616">I also want to point out—and I think this is probably something that the member hopes will happen—that when the courts rule on these grounds, they usually assume that the old language was inadequate and that they should make new and broader interpretations and that such broader interpretations must be sought. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="3208617">Therefore, I would argue that in this case it is not defined properly and that those interpretations are inappropriate for good legislation. The definitions are undefined and inadequate and because of that alone, this legislation needs to be rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208618">There are a number of other things I would like to talk about, and I understand I have some time in the next hour. However, I want to mention that the member said earlier at committee that the United Nations had supported proposals such as his. The reality is that while the Commissioner for Human Rights has called for some of these changes, the United Nations has not supported them. In fact, several of its commissions have turned away from supporting these notions that he has brought forward today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208623">Mr. Speaker, in October of last year I asked the <Affiliation DbId="170681" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> who cared for our soldiers after they came home from deployment. The government likes to tout that it supports our troops. However, the minute those troops become veterans, they are all but forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208624">A case in point is the government's lump sum payment plan for injured veterans. For the most part, the lump sum payment plan has proven to be a failure. In some cases, injured vets get only 10% of what they have received through the courts or worker's compensation. Imagine having to fight the government in court to get a fair pension after risking everything for one's country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208625">I asked the minister back in the fall when the Conservatives planned to change the lump sum formula to ensure that veterans received the pensions they deserve. His answer did not address the issue. He did not seem to appreciate that some veterans received less than they would on worker's compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208626">Another glaring example of how veterans are abandoned is the government phasing out access to long-term care beds for modern veterans. These veterans are people with special care needs and requirements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208627">The New Democrats are advocating that the federal government continue the veterans' long-term care program. Currently, World War II and Korean veterans are eligible for dedicated departmental contract beds or priority beds in veterans' hospital wings such as Parkwood Hospital in London, Sunnybrook in Toronto, Camp Hill in Halifax or approved provincial community care facilities if they meet certain criteria. This program will cease when the last World War II or Korean war vet passes away and the Conservative government has no intention to open access up to CF and RCMP veterans. This means that veterans will no longer have priority access to departmental contract beds and will compete with the civilian population for access to long-term care in provincial community care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208628">Unlike the minister, the New Democrats continue to advocate for veterans because the federal government does have a responsibility for their long-term care in recognition of those who accept the unlimited liability of service in the armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208629">The NDP proposes that veterans have access to veterans' hospital wards throughout Canada staffed with health care professionals experienced in the dedicated and exclusive treatment of injured veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208630">The minister is not getting the message and people are suffering, people such as retired air force Colonel Neil Russell, who is confined to a wheelchair. He cannot return home and he was callously denied a long-term care bed at Parkwood Hospital in London. It was ludicrous because Neil would have been on the street because there was a one to two year waiting list for a nursing home bed. After many letters to the minister and media pressure, Colonel Russell was told he had a bed. Sadly, within a few days, he was then told he did not have a bed and was informed that he had misunderstood and was given a provincial contract bed, for which he has to pay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208631">I would like to remind the minister that veterans are a federal responsibility not a provincial responsibility. They have served our country and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Ensuring that they have access to the long-term care they require is the least we can do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208632">Will the minister do the right thing and support long-term care for all of our veterans?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208633">Mr. Speaker, I can understand why my colleague wants to change the focus of her question, because the reality is that we have answered the question she asked last fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208634">When Parliament passed the new veterans charter in 2005, it was with unanimous support. The new veterans charter is a suite of programs and services that can be modified and adapted as time passes. The perfect example of this evolution is when our government implemented new payment options for the disability award, which is what the member opposite wanted to address. We heard loud and clear that the veterans wanted options, and we listened. Now they have the choice of receiving the lump sum payment, an annual installment over a number of years of their choosing, or a combination of the two payment plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208635">When we introduced enhancements to the new veterans charter just last year, we took steps to ensure that the most seriously injured veterans would receive the support, financial or otherwise, that they truly needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208636">Veterans can now receive comprehensive care that goes well beyond the immediate and long-term financial support available to them. This model also includes full physical and psychological rehabilitation as well as vocational assistance, health care benefits and one-on-one case management.This includes things like home visits or visits by a registered nurse so that a service injured veteran does not have to leave his or her home to visit an office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208637">We have done this because offering a comprehensive care and support system such as that found in the new veterans charter will lead to rehabilitation and will further enable a smooth transition by veterans back to civilian life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208638">Why, since the new veterans charter came in, have the member and her party voted against so many initiatives that have been brought in. The member voted against Agent Orange funding, against veterans benefits services and even against long-term care. It is all very puzzling. Most sadly, the NDP has voted against increased funding for our most seriously injured veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208639">We on this side of the House are focused on delivering concrete results for Canadian veterans. We have introduced direct deposit so that veterans no longer have to travel to the bank to receive their benefits. We have eliminated over 2.5 million phone calls, mailings or other steps veterans once needed to complete to gain access to the information and benefits they needed. Veterans no longer have to send in receipts, for example, for a $15 snow clearing expense, only to be reimbursed weeks later—no more under our government. Instead, we provide that funding up front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208640">In all, our government is focused on improving the lives of Canadian veterans by introducing measures to empower them in their quest to transition back to civilian life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208641">The real question I think we should ask this evening is whether the NDP and Liberal leaders in the future will let my colleague across the way actually vote for veterans benefits this year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208642">Mr. Speaker, it absolutely astounds me that Conservatives can sit there and perpetuate this nonsense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208643">We voted against environmental destruction. We voted against seniors being robbed of their pensions. We voted against all of the incredible and undermining things the government has done and plans to do to people all across the country, undermining employment insurance and undermining the poor. How dare they come here and say that somehow or other these insidious things are going to benefit anyone at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208644">Conservatives want to abandon veterans. They have made it very clear. They will not support modern-day veterans, and most modern-day veterans have no idea that they are not covered under long-term care. The government has made a very clear decision that it is going to dump the problems, costs and responsibility onto the provinces. They do it every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208645">Veterans are a federal responsibility. They are not a provincial responsibility.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="3208646">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate to see my colleague against everything. As she said, they voted against, they voted against, they voted against, and it is true. New Democrats have voted against veterans regularly as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208647">However, the reality is that we have done a number of great things for veterans, including changing the payment options for them to receive their payments, which is what the member wanted back when she asked the question. I mentioned that we have done things such as full physical and psychological rehabilitation opportunities, vocational assistance, health care benefits and one-on-one case management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="3208648">We are there for veterans. We will be there for them in the future, and we ask the NDP to join with us in that as well.</ParaText>
