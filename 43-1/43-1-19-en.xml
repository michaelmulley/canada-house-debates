              <ParaText id="6052625">Born in the town of Rouyn-Noranda in northwestern Quebec, Christie wrote for the Toronto Star, the Toronto Sun, the National Post and the Globe and Mail.

              <ParaText id="6052626">Christie always wrote with a unique balance of toughness and tenderness. From time to time, I had the privilege of debating the news of the day with Christie on Newstalk 1010 radio. She was relentless in her pursuit of the truth and the facts that would help us understand the issues we face every day. I respected that in her, but I also respected her courage to unabashedly share her point of view, even when it was controversial. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052627">Maybe that is why Newstalk 1010 morning host John Moore recently said, “There are certain figures you turn to, to make sense of the world around you. She was one of those.” I could not agree more.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052653">Congenital heart disease, or CHD, affects over 250,000 Canadians across our country. It is the world's leading birth defect, with roughly one in 90 Canadian children being diagnosed with some form of it each year, including holes in the heart, valve defects, stenosis of arteries and veins, and much more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052654">Thankfully, with technological and medical advancements, today about 90% of these children survive to adulthood. There is no cure for CHD, which means access to specialized care is essential, particularly for Canadian adults. Research on adult CHD has not reached the same level as other areas of heart disease, even though it has the potential to have a huge impact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052655">I encourage all Canadians to follow the mission of the Canadian Congenital Heart Alliance. We need to spread the word about the growing population of survivors and help them get the care and support they need to live long and healthy lives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052911"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce my private member's bill that I had originally introduced in the previous parliamentary session. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052912">Last year, the bill passed unanimously through all stages in the House in just 25 sitting days. Unfortunately, it died on the Order Paper at second reading in the Senate when the election was called. I am here, once again, to introduce this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052913">There are approximately 4,600 Canadians currently awaiting a life-saving organ transplant. While 90% of Canadians approve of organ and tissue donation, only about 20% of Canadians actually have registered consent with their provincial or territorial registries. This is an absolutely unacceptable number, and this is where we can help as parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052914">My bill would assist Canadian provinces and territories in growing and maintaining their organ and tissue donor registries. The bill is simple. It would ask Canadians on their annual income tax return if they consent to having their provincial or territorial government be informed of their desire to be added to their organ and tissue donor registry. It is that simple: a question of consent on the income tax form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052915">Currently, the Canada Revenue Agency prohibits the use of the income tax form for any purpose other than the administration of taxes. In order to allow for a question regarding organ and tissue donation on the tax form, a legal exemption must be created. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052916">This was done once before on the tax form so that Elections Canada could ask Canadians for updated contact information. Again, what I am proposing is that a simple question of organ and tissue donation be placed on the tax form alongside the Elections Canada question.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052942">It calls on the government to name the overdose crisis what it is in this country, a public health emergency, and to take the kinds of steps that are required based on evidence. The petitioners are concerned that we take a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach; recognize that the opioid crisis is primarily a health issue, not a criminal issue; and listen to experts and front-line workers and decriminalize drugs in Canada.</ParaText>

The reason they are concerned is that herring dropped approximately one-third between 2016 and 2019. The unexpected drop in herring in 2019 was due to overfishing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052965"> In testimony before the McDonald commission, the former commissioner of the RCMP stated that they did indeed intercept mail on a very restricted basis and that the practice was not one which had been concealed from ministers.

The Speaker was concerned that despite the fact that the Minister of National Defence stated that he had no intention of misleading the House, contradictory statements were made by the minister, and the records were left with two different versions of events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052968"> On March 9, 2011, the Speaker considered a matter where it was alleged that the minister of international co-operation made misleading statements in committee and the House. The Speaker noted that a standing committee had made material available that could be measured against other material, including statements in the House and answers to oral and written questions. He said that the statements made by the minister had, at the very least, caused confusion. He then decided to allow the member to propose his motion to the House referring to recent precedent and mindful of a ruling by Speaker Jerome to the effect that in case of doubt on a question, the Speaker should leave it to the House to decide.</ParaText>

The bill is premised on the conviction that when survivors of sexual assault appear before our courts, they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to be assured that the law of sexual assault is being faithfully applied. There is no room for court decisions to be tainted by harmful myths and stereotypes of how survivors of sexual assault ought to behave. The determination to tackle this problem is deeply held by this government. However, I know it is also shared by parliamentarians from all regions of the country and all political stripes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052982">For far too long, victims of sexual assault have had to deal with a justice system that does not treat them with the dignity they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052983">Many victims of sexual assault decide not to file a complaint because they are afraid of being mistreated and humiliated. That is why most sexual assaults committed in Canada are not reported to the police.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6052984">This is not an issue that is easy to resolve. Parliament alone cannot do it. Improving the way the justice system treats victims of sexual assault requires the mobilization of all levels of government and many stakeholders for broad action. In addition, all members of Canadian society have a shared responsibility to challenge and counter the myths, stereotypes and attitudes that have a pernicious effect on our justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052985">In this regard, education and information play a critical role. I applaud the extraordinary work that many organizations and individuals right around Canada are doing tirelessly to this end. However, Parliament has its own responsibilities. As parliamentarians, we can and we must take action. Canadians need to know that their elected representatives in this chamber are resolutely working toward a criminal justice system that all Canadians can trust and turn to, especially those who are the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052986">To this end, this bill seeks to ensure that superior court judges have the awareness, skills and knowledge to handle sexual assault cases in a manner that is fair to the parties, that is free from myths and stereotypes and that treats survivors with utmost dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052987">The bill also promotes rigour and transparency by requiring that judges provide reasons for their decisions in sexual assault proceedings and that these reasons be set out in writing or in the record of the proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052988">I would like to acknowledge the remarkable leadership on this matter by the Hon. Rona Ambrose, the former interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, in the last Parliament. In the previous Parliament, Ms. Ambrose introduced Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, the predecessor to the very bill before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052989"> As we will recall, Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document> received unanimous support in this very chamber, strengthened by an amendment brought forward by the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, which did excellent work in studying the bill. The committee worked to amend it to include social context education in the bill. That complementary piece will ensure that judicial training and education includes working to better understand the demographics, the background and the lived experience of the litigants who appear before our courts.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6052990">The Senate sent the bill to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which proposed meaningful amendments to address concerns about the bill undermining the independence of the justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052991">Members may recall that many stakeholders and parliamentarians, including the bill's sponsor, applauded the work of the Senate committee to improve the bill in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052992">I agree with that view of the committee's amendments. Unfortunately, we were unable to pass the bill before the end of the previous Parliament.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6052993">Since the last Parliament, we have seen cross-party support for reviving this important measure. This is evidence of the strong support for the convictions underpinning this important bill, convictions which transcend political parties and partisan interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052994">I want to thank all the parties, as well as our colleagues in the other chamber, for their commitment to a collaborative approach to this initiative. Canadians have sent us to this chamber with a clear message that they expect parliamentarians to work together. Our work on the bill is a clear illustration that we are listening and acting accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6052995">The bill places particular emphasis on the judiciary. Our government recognizes the need for education, not only for judges but also for all actors in the justice system. We are working with our provincial and territorial counterparts and justice stakeholders to expand our efforts in this area. However, the focus of the bill before the House today is on judges. To be a judge is to bear an important responsibility.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053001">Given judges' fundamental role, the public has especially high expectations of them. The Canadian Judicial Council put it as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053002">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> From the time they are considered for appointment to the Bench, and every day thereafter, superior court judges in Canada are expected to be knowledgeable jurists. They are also expected to demonstrate a number of personal attributes including knowledge of social issues, an awareness of changes in social values, humility, fairness, empathy, tolerance, consideration and respect for others. In short, Canadians expect their judges to know the law but also to possess empathy and to recognize and question any past personal attitudes and sympathies that might prevent them from acting fairly.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6053003">In order for judges to meet these very high public expectations, relevant judicial education is essential. This education must be continually evolving in order for judges to perform their duties in situations that are constantly changing, that are dynamic. A lot of great work is being done now, but now there is a need to enshrine in legislation that this is an expected requirement going forward. That is why judicial education is a central feature of the bill under consideration before us now, Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053004">Our criminal law has undergone considerable reform over the past three decades to encourage reporting of sexual assaults; to improve the criminal justice system's response to sexualized violence; and to counter discriminatory views of survivors that stem from myths and stereotypes about how a “true victim” is expected to behave. We know that such perceptions, myths and stereotypes have no role in the justice system in 2020, and that is what the bill targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053005">As a result, the Criminal Code prohibits all forms of non-consensual sexual activity. It provides a clear definition of consent. It identifies when consent cannot be obtained. It sets out the rules for admissibility of certain types of evidence to deter the introduction of these harmful myths and stereotypes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053006">I would now like to explain a few of the proposed legislative amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053007">The bill before us is, as I mentioned at the outset, essentially the same as the former Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, as amended by the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053008"> In order to require newly appointed judges to undergo training on sexual assault law and social context, the bill proposes to amend the Judges Act and to include a new eligibility requirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053009">Under this amendment, candidates for employment as a judge of the superior court will be required to make a commitment to undertake this type of training if they are appointed. That is an important caveat. Upon appointment is when the training would take place. This training is to ensure that the courts take into account Canada's extensive law and jurisprudence on sexual assault and information on the social context of litigants, without being influenced by preconceived or erroneous ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053010">The bill would also clarify that seminars established by the Canadian Judicial Council on matters related to sexual assault law must be developed after consultation with groups or individuals the council considers appropriate, including sexual assault survivors and groups supporting them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053011">In addition, the bill would require the Canadian Judicial Council to provide to the Minister of Justice, for tabling in Parliament, an annual report containing details on seminars offered on matters relating to sexual assault law and indicating the number of judges who have been attending. This is intended to enhance accountability in the education of sitting judges on these matters and to act as an incentive to encourage their participation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053012">Finally, the bill would amend the Criminal Code to require judges to provide reasons for decisions under sexual assault provisions of the Criminal Code. This amendment is intended to enhance the transparency of judicial decisions made in sexual assault proceedings by rendering them accessible, either in writing or on the record of the proceedings, so oral reasons would be sufficient as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053013">I want to mention that this proposed amendment to require judges to provide reasons in the determination of sexual assault matters specifically is complementary to three currently existing requirements:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053014">First, the members in the chamber should understand that section 726.2 of the Criminal Code requires judges to provide reasons when they are sentencing decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053015">Second, there is jurisprudence from the Supreme Court in a 2002 decision called Sheppard, which requires judges to provide reasons for their decisions more generally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053016">Third, subsections 278.8(2) and 278.94(5) of the Criminal Code require judges to provide reasons when determining whether certain types of evidence should be admitted in sexual assault cases.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053017"> Under this bill, the obligation to state reasons will be added to the other Criminal Code provisions relating to sexual assault. As a result, all provisions relating to sexual offences will be clear and accessible to the people applying them, thereby reducing the risk of an erroneous application of law by countering the potential influence of myths and stereotypes about victims of sexual assault and their behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053018">This approach is in line with the Supreme Court of Canada's finding that these myths and stereotypes can undermine the courts' truth-seeking function.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053019">It is also important to note for the purposes of today's debate that the government has already committed significant resources to support the availability of enhanced judicial training in this very area. In the 2017 budget, we provided the Canadian Judicial Council with $2.7 million over five years, and half a million dollars per year thereafter, to ensure that more judges have access to professional development, with a greater focus in particular on gender and culturally sensitive training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053020">Our government is also actively at work with stakeholders to ensure that appropriate training is available to all of Canada's judiciary, including judges who are not federally appointed. Again, I want to acknowledge in this chamber the leadership and determination of the Hon. Rona Ambrose in making this happen as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053021">Next, I want to turn to the important principle of judicial independence. This bill is designed to support that constitutionally entrenched principle. I parenthetically note that in my previous life as a constitutional litigator, I spent considerable time working on this very principle and dealing with this very issue. I am very proud to say today that the bill we are debating in this chamber clearly supports the principle of judicial independence and, importantly, the principle that the education of judges should be the responsibility of the judiciary. That is an important feature that is entrenched in this bill.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053022">Whatever measures are taken to ensure that judges have access to sexual assault training and its social context, those measures would be ill-advised if they interfere with judicial independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053023">Public trust requires knowing not only that judges have the expertise required to settle the disputes that come before them but also that they are independent of Parliament, the executive branch and any other group that could try to unduly influence them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053024">We in Canada are fortunate to have a strong, independent judicial system. We cannot take this independence for granted, and as parliamentarians, we must work to preserve and promote it.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053025">What I can report to this chamber is that Canada's judiciary is strongly committed to ensuring that the best possible education is available to judges. In fact Canada, thankfully, is an internationally respected leader in judicial education and is a trailblazer in social context education in particular. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053026">Let me briefly highlight the important roles of two organizations that oversee the work of judges. The first is the Canadian Judicial Council, which I briefly mentioned earlier, and the second is the National Judicial Institute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053027">The Canadian Judicial Council is responsible for setting professional development requirements for superior court judges. In its professional development policy, the council requires judges newly appointed to a superior court to complete an education program for new judges, as well as to complete a more general program within five years of appointment. These programs include sexual assault law and social context education. What we are doing with this bill is making this a formal requirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053028">The National Judicial Institute is responsible for the overall coordination of judicial education in Canada. In addition to being a primary education provider, the National Judicial Institute is an internationally recognized leader in judicial education. The institute seeks to integrate substantive law, skills development and awareness of social context in all of its programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053029"> I want to acknowledge the significant commitment of the Canadian Judicial Council and the National Judicial Institute to ensuring that judges have access to the training they need. We thank them for their full commitment to a justice system that all Canadians can trust, especially those who are most vulnerable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053030">It is also important to acknowledge in this chamber the important and respectful dialogue between the judicial and legislative branches that the previous bill, Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, triggered in the last Parliament, which I am confident will continue as the current bill, Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, is debated and studied. All partners in this dialogue share a strong commitment to a justice system that survivors of sexual assault can trust and that all vulnerable persons can trust, a justice system that treats them with the dignity and respect they so dearly deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053031">It is also important to outline how this bill would work within the context of other government commitments and government actions. Supporting victims and survivors of crime is a priority for our government. This includes working with provinces and territories to provide free legal advice and support to survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence. It includes the government's commitment, announced in the Speech from the Throne, to build on the gender-based violence strategy and work with partners to develop a national action plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053032">The bill before us represents a major step forward. It gives parliamentarians an opportunity to send a clear message to all Canadian victims of sexual assault that we are not indifferent to their experiences, that their courage is an inspiration and that they deserve a justice system that treats them with the utmost dignity and respect. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053035">I am proud to indicate that the NDP will be supporting this bill to go forward to committee, but I have a number of questions for the <Affiliation DbId="253813" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>. We know that often complainants in sexual assault cases are provided inadequate social supports and inadequate information about the court process, and they are often confronted with a system that completely ignores their wishes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053037">My second question is with regard to the TRC's call to action number 27, which recommends that lawyers receive extensive training on first nations indigenous issues, particularly with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as systemic racism, which we are now seeing all across Canada. I wonder what the government may do to require training for judges to bring their competency up in those particular areas.</ParaText>

I want to thank him and his party for their support of this bill. It is quite critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053039">To address the first part of the question, the member opposite asked about some of the social supports, and I will readily confess that this obviously cannot be done in a vacuum. We need to be doing what we can to address the very difficult circumstances that face a number of victims, in particular sexual assault victims, when they interact with the justice system. I think what this would do is address the adjudication side with respect to sensitizing judges in their understanding of the issues, but there are many complementary pieces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053040">He raised the issue of the lawyers and potential legal support. One could also raise the issue about the police and their interactions with sexual assault victims and survivors. I think it all needs to be done in a complementary piece, and I look forward to aspects of the gender violence strategy that will look to those different dimensions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053041">The <Affiliation DbId="245291" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>'s mandate letter states that he has been given a mandate to ensure that legal aid supports are there, in particular for survivors of sexual violence. I think that is a good step in terms of addressing the access to justice piece that the hon. member mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053042">With respect to the TRC calls to action, there are many that still need to be addressed. We know this. There are many that also relate to the MMIWG's calls for justice. With respect to the lawyers' training, what I will indicate to him in all candour is that a previous incarnation of this bill looked at potentially having the training apply to all applicants, regardless of whether they were appointed. The current iteration of the bill looks at applicants who are undertaking this training because they have been appointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053043">It is an open question. As a member of the bar, I think all members of my profession need to have a better understanding and sensitivity training with respect to how to handle these issues and the issues that face all vulnerable people.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053045">I wonder about openness to amendments. One came to mind recently when I had constituents asking in town hall meetings about a decision of an Immigration and Refugee Board adjudicator, a Ms. Randhawa. Her decision was appalling, and it was overturned in the Federal Court of Appeal. It occurs to me that perhaps we need to expand the range of training. In this particular case, the IRB adjudicator refused a request for refugee status because the adjudicator found it not credible that the woman who feared returning to her home country for fear of violent attack by an intimate partner had kept a child of rape, and therefore, the adjudicator said, it could not have really been rape. It is very upsetting to imagine that we have adjudicators with life-and-death control over people seeking protection in Canada.</ParaText>

It has been carefully calibrated to deal with the constitutional principle of judicial independence. Without going too much into the weeds, I would say to the hon. member that when dealing with adjudicators that are outside the scope of what is called a federally appointed judge or a superior court judge, there is the ability to be more prescriptive. Therefore, for people who adjudicate in quasi-judicial tribunals, for administrative adjudicators or decision-makers, there is the possibility to be even more prescriptive and more directive with respect to the training that needs to take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053049">I know about the case the member has mentioned. That has been raised on the floor of the House, and quite appropriately so, because the fact that those types of myths and stereotypes are being perpetuated by various levels of adjudicators around this country and by various government appointees in this country is deeply problematic and needs to be addressed.</ParaText>

We know it is not a hospitable environment by any means, and there are significant challenges. Those challenges are exponentially multiplied when individuals also have other intersecting components in their lived experience, such as being racialized women or indigenous women in particular. We heard about that a great deal in the MMIWG's calls for justice. Addressing that aspect is something we are very committed to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053055"> I am very pleased that in the study on the status of women in the previous Parliament, social context was inserted into the bill to make sure that the judges' lens of analysis and their information and training would accommodate for all of that lived experience that litigants present when they appear in court, but that needs to be fleshed out even further.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6053065">Madam Speaker, I am sure the House will be thankful for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053066">I am a proud member of the Law Society, and, because of that, part of the justice system. The justice system is supposed to be a safe place for victims of sexual assault. However, our justice system has had a checkered history in fairly weighing the rights of the victims versus those of the accused in sexual assault cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053067">Incredibly, up until 1983, a woman's claim of sexual assault could be undermined by evidence submitted with respect to her sexual history. A woman's claim of sexual assault could be undermined or even dismissed because of such trivial, terrible considerations as the length of her skirt or her recent dating history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053068">I am glad to see that as a country, we have grown to understand that we need to stop blaming victims in cases of sexual assault and put the blame where it should be, directly at the feet of the perpetrator. However, Canada still faces a sexual assault epidemic, and our justice system appears only marginally capable of dealing with the torrent of these sexual assault cases. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053069">There are over 400,000 sexual assaults in Canada every year. By some measures, for every thousand sexual assaults that occur in Canada, only 33 are reported to police. That is unacceptable in a country as good and as great as Canada. Of those 33 reported assaults, believe it or not, charges are brought in only 12 cases; six cases are prosecuted and three cases lead to a conviction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053070">This is an extremely disturbing statistic. I have a sister and a mother, and the most precious thing in my life, other than my son in equal amounts, is my daughter. I now know that if she were to come across sexual violence, there would be less than a 0.1% chance of her perpetrator being brought to justice in Canada. That is a truly disturbing and atrocious number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053071">There are a number of reasons why victims do not report sexual assault, including shame, self-blame, feeling there is a lack of evidence, embarrassment and fear of retaliation. Another overlying reason is the lack of faith in the criminal justice system. As a member of the bar and this system, that deeply hurts me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053072">If there is anything we can do to improve the system for victims of sexual assault, that should be something we do. I will definitely be supporting this bill. In fact, I salute the government for bringing this important piece of legislation forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053073">The lack of respect for women seems not to be limited to just the justice system. It seems that it has spread across the government. As we have seen recently, a Parole Board member in Quebec advised a violent criminal, one who had killed his own wife, to seek the services of a sex worker. That resulted in her violent death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053074">She was a beautiful, wonderful woman. God only knows what impact she could have had on society or what good she could have done for our world. Unfortunately, her life was snuffed out all too early, when she was merely a young woman.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053075">We have also heard the stories in this House of what happened with the refugee board when a refugee adjudicator said that rape could not be rape if a woman decided to keep the child. I could not imagine something more offensive than that comment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053076">I call upon the government to look at this as an opportunity to spread the type of sensitivity training it is talking about for judges. It is honourable and I will support it. However, we should go beyond our judges to perhaps our adjudicators and to other individuals within the government who appear to desperately need this training. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053077">Victims of sexual assault and sexual violence are throughout our community. Indeed, some statistics put it as high as one in three women will experience some form of sexual violence in their lifetime.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6053078">As a father of a four-year-old daughter, that statistic is absolutely disturbing to me. It is something that as a community, not just as legislators, we need to spend every resource on stopping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053079">While the number of men who experience sexual violence is much smaller, this is a pressing issue for everyone. Victims of sexual assault are, after all, our daughters, sisters, mothers, friends and co-workers. Quite frankly, they deserve better from us and they deserve more protection. We must, as a society, attempt to drive this out of our communities, our country and indeed our world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053080">Part of ending sexual violence is not just punishing the perpetrators of these heinous acts, but also helping the victims feel more comfortable in sharing their stories. Part of the reason this legislation is so important is that we need to make sure judges deal appropriately with these cases and make it as palatable as possible for the victims of sexual violence to tell their stories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053081">Many victims do not feel comfortable coming forward because of their lack of faith in the criminal justice system. They do the incredible and difficult feat of coming forward and then meet the new challenge of facing our justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053082">Sadly, some judges have indicated they do not understand what sexual consent means, even though it is clear in law and in the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053083">Some judges have gone so far as to ask a victim in court why she could not just keep her knees together. Those comments need to never be said again in a courtroom or anywhere in Canada. Other comments have been made asking why the victim did not scream while the alleged assault took place or why the victim did not skew her pelvis to avoid penetration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053084">I am paraphrasing actual statements that were said in a court of law. These are disgusting words that should never be spoken anywhere in our country, much less in a courtroom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053085">Perhaps by giving judges the necessary training we can avoid these outlandish comments and give victims more confidence in our justice system so they will know they will be treated with respect when they perform the ultimate act of bravery and confront their perpetrators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053086">I will be honest. As a man it is hard to speak about these cases because I cannot possibly understand what these women have gone through. I honestly cannot imagine the horror of living through sexual violence and being forced to retell that story over and over again. These women come forward to protect other women only to have their credibility questioned or to have to face their tormentor over and over again. However, this is what the criminal justice system demands for justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053087">Fixing our criminal justice system is about helping our federal judges begin to understand the quiet suffering of victims of sexual violence and teaching our judges to be more compassionate toward the victims. This bill is not about fixing our justice system as much as it is about making Canada a safer, more friendly place for all women and children. This bill not only makes sense but is also a step in the right direction for all victims of sexual assault across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053088">I will wholeheartedly support this bill, and I salute the government for bringing it forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053096">We are dealing with federally appointed superior court judges. Obviously, the front lines of most of the criminal law work in Canada is actually at the provincial court. The court in the province that the member and I share is the Ontario court, and each province around the country has its court. This is where most sexual assault complainants and survivors will have their interaction with the justice system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053097">I have a general point, which is that we are trying to lead by example at the federal level, but we cannot impose the same sort of mandatory training requirements on the provincial sphere, at the provincial level of government with provincial court judges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053098">Given the member's strong commitment and conviction with respect to the importance of this bill, would he join with us in the overall work with provincial governments to encourage them to follow suit?

              <ParaText id="6053105">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to stand in this place to deliver my maiden speech on behalf of my constituents in Calgary Skyview. Being elected as their representative is a very humbling experience, and I am very grateful for this opportunity. I have lived most of my life in Calgary and I cannot think of a better place to grow up. We are so fortunate for our rich, diverse communities that thrive on hard work and a true sense of belonging to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053106">Throughout my campaign, I met many of my constituents to learn from them how best I could help make their life easier as their member of Parliament. Most notably, I met a young woman in my riding who said to me, “I have never seen anyone who looks like me do what you are doing. I want to go to school and do what you do.” This sentiment meant a lot to me. What she saw was the first Sikh female to be elected in the House of Commons from Alberta. Other constituents would say “Our daughters are looking up to you.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053107">I am proud to stand here today to represent not just those young women in my riding, but anyone who has dreamed of a life in service and of being here. I began imagining my journey to this place when I was really young. I would watch Amnesty International and my heart went out to those people. I would sit there and cry. Their stories moved me. I decided then I would practise law. Being a lawyer has been a tremendous honour for me. It is something I am very passionate about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053108">This is why this legislation we are debating today is very important to me as a lawyer, as a woman, and now as the deputy shadow cabinet minister for women and gender equality. I want to thank Ms. Ambrose for tabling this important legislation in the previous Parliament and for her dedication to this crucial issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053109">Her bill, Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, received widespread support from parliamentarians and stakeholders. I am encouraged to see it moving forward. I am also pleased to see it as one of our commitments in our platform during the campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053110">Similar to Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, the bill we are debating today, Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, adds new eligibility for lawyers seeking appointment to the judiciary to require the completion of a recent and comprehensive education in sexual assault law as well as social context education. It requires the Canadian Judicial Council to submit an annual report to Parliament regarding the details on seminars offered on matters relating to sexual assault law and the number of judges attending. It does this while still maintaining the balance between judiciary independence and a fair criminal justice system, which is very important to me and to all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053111">The rationale for the need for the bill is all too familiar, given the recent spotlight on the treatment of sexual assault victims during trial. Sadly, this is certainly not something that is new. Let us explore the current state as it stands now. There is piecemeal training and education available in certain jurisdictions, but it is not mandatory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053112">We saw in 2016, a judge was found to have relied on myths about the expected behaviour of a victim of sexual abuse. That case was overturned on appeal for obvious reasons. We have seen instances of judges and the use of insensitive language when referring to victims, which can further lead to stigma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053113">In 2019, there were nearly a dozen cases going through Canada's court system that shed light on how judges continue to rely on myths and stereotypes when informing their decisions on sexual assault cases. Here we are, still seeing similar misinformation about the experience of sexual assault victims or victims of abuse, which can lead to poor decisions and, as we have seen, possible miscarriages of justice, sometimes resulting in new trials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053114">Retrials can be incredibly painful for the complainants, potentially further revictimizing them. The way victims are treated during their court proceedings as well as in the public eye we know is a major hindrance to reporting the crime in the first place. Victims witness how other sexual assault victims are treated in the justice system and are concerned that if they come forward, they will be treated in the same way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053115">We know that sexual assault is one of the most under-reported crimes in Canada. Of reported cases, only 12% result in a criminal conviction within six years, compared to 23% of physical assaults, as reported by Statistics Canada. We know the reasons for under-reporting include shame, guilt and stigma of sexual victimization. Victims also report the belief that they would not see a positive outcome in the justice system. This simply cannot stand.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6053116">What can we do? The best way to prevent this kind of sentiment is through education and training. The path forward that this legislation sets, similar to Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, allows for more confidence in the criminal justice system by ensuring lawyers who are appointed to the bench are trained and educated in this very specific type of case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053117">The future state, with this bill passed, is the hope that with education and training, the stories we have once heard of victims made to feel “less than” will not be repeated. This legislation is intended to help reduce the stigma of coming forward, of reporting the crimes and seeing justice prevail for the victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053118">The hope is that with education and training, the victims of sexual assault will be treated with respect and avoid, at all costs, being revictimized, which can be incredibly traumatizing for the individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053119">As Ms. Ambrose said during her testimony before the status of women committee, “Really...for me it's about building confidence. Women do not have confidence in our justice system when it comes to sexual assault law.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053120">This has to change if we are going to see an increase in sexual assaults being reported and convicted. This piece of legislation will bring us one step closer to eliminating barriers and giving victims of sexual assault more confidence to come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053121">Unfortunately, as we know, it is not just with the justice system where we see these types of myths and misunderstanding. The recent tragic death of a young woman in Quebec sheds a light on the broad scope of this issue. Marylène Levesque was killed at the hands of a convicted murderer who had a history of domestic violence and was granted day parole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053122"> At a hearing into the offender's previous request for full parole, the board heard from his parole officer that while living in a halfway house, he had been allowed to have his sexual needs met. How was a man with a history of violence against women granted permission to have his sexual needs met?</ParaText>

When we look at judicial training, we see what we are trying to do at the federal level, and we see a bit of a checkerboard at the provincial level. She is a member of the bar, as am I. She practises in a different province. Alberta, among nine other provinces, does not have any form of mandatory training with respect to sexual assault awareness or social context education for its judges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053130">I put a similar suggestion forward in my question for the parliamentary secretary about people within the Immigration and Refugee Board. The hon. member has raised an excellent point about people on parole boards. However, the government has structured the bill around judicial discretion and the Judges Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053131">I think we really have to ask the government to consider it because, at the amendment stage before committee, we will not have the scope to bring in other legislation and other bills. At this early stage, there is so much support for the bill as written and concern that it should extend beyond judges to others who make basically life-and-death decisions, as the hon. member's question so rightly points out, without adequate understanding of the context, the risks and so on.</ParaText>

My sense is that when we go to committee for clause by clause, amendments such as the ones we are discussing here will be ruled out of order, as beyond the scope of the bill.

              <ParaText id="6053137">Madam Speaker, it should come as no surprise that the Bloc Québécois will be supporting Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053138">Our party supported the previous version of the bill introduced by the former interim leader of the Conservative Party, our colleague Rona Ambrose. After eagerly supporting it, I even sought the House's support for a motion calling on the Senate to fast-track the bill, since we were nearing the end of the parliamentary session. Unfortunately, what we feared came to pass: Our colleague's bill died on the Order Paper. We hope Bill C-5 will not suffer the same fate, and we are eager to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053139">Bill C-5 is important. It is a short bill, just a few pages long, on which we all seem to agree. Despite its apparent simplicity, this bill is critically important since it concerns the public's confidence in its judicial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053140">Everyone knows that the judicial system is the backbone of any society. What will people do if they no longer trust their judicial system? They will take justice into their own hands. The extreme actions we occasionally see that we cannot abide would only multiply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053141">As lawmakers, it is our responsibility to ensure that our judicial system is credible and meets with the approval and has the support of all or the vast majority of the population. It is my view that passing this bill as quickly as possible would be in the interest of justice, those involved in the justice system, and the rule of law that we are responsible for protecting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053142">What impact will it have? The answer is simple. We are talking about the education of judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053143">My Conservative colleague just reminded us of the situation that recently unfolded when an individual was released even though, in our opinion, he never should have been. It is a specific case, but it clearly illustrates a problem in our society. We are ill-informed and we often make decisions based on stereotypes, images or preconceived ideas about certain situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053144">The issue that Bill C-5 addresses, sexual assault, is one that we are particularly ill-equipped and poorly trained to deal with, and our judgment in such matters is often biased. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053145">I know quite a few judges, and most of them have a sterling reputation and are intelligent people of goodwill who show courage in the rulings they make, rulings that make sense and that are made in the interest of justice 99.9% of the time. Unfortunately, mistakes are occasionally made that damage the image of justice and undermine public confidence in the judicial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053146">It is up to us as lawmakers to rectify the situation and restore public confidence. We have to make sure our judges have all the tools they need to do their work with the high degree of professionalism they bring to it now and want to keep bringing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053147">In virtually every case, a judge must assess the credibility of witnesses, the victim and the accused. Often, this is where a judge can be influenced by preconceived notions not out of malice but as a result of their experience and our culture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053148">That is exactly the kind of situation Bill C-5 seeks to address by providing better training for judges and raising awareness for everyone, including lawmakers, about the reality of sexual assault. How do victims react to given situations? Why do they not remember or remember inaccurately? Why do they misinterpret the events surrounding the assault? There are many important elements here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6053149">If we want the justice system to work properly, we need to make sure the courts have a firm grasp of these issues. When asked to assess the credibility of a witness, a judge must have sufficient academic and practical knowledge to deliver a judgment that is sound and, above all, that all Canadians can trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053150">It is normal for rulings to be overturned. Every day, rulings are handed down by the courts, and every day, rulings are overturned by the court of appeal. Sometimes the decision is two against one, as the judgment is not unanimous. Those cases go to the Supreme Court, which also often quashes appeal court rulings. Those judgments are not always unanimous either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053151">We cannot expect judges to deliver unimpeachable decisions. There is just no way. They would have to be superhuman. That will never happen. However, we can expect them to provide reasons for their decisions and make credible decisions. Ultimately, the public can always wonder whether the judge was right or wrong, but they will trust the judge. That is our goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053152">That is what Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> proposes, and we are okay with that. We believe this is essential in our current justice system. For all of these reasons, and for the reasons cited by all of my colleagues over the past few years, we will be voting in favour of Bill C-5, and we hope it will be passed as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053186">In my view, the justice system is the backbone of our society. I have said so from the start. Knowing that all parliamentarians share this view and that Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> should be adopted tells me that we have a strong backbone. We have what we wanted, that is, a consensus among Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053193">I want to start my speech on Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> by acknowledging the incredibly important role that judges play in our justice system. These are men and women who are put in very difficult positions. They have to weigh incredible amounts of evidence before them and make judgments as to whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, a person is guilty of the crime that the Crown is putting forward as an argument. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053194">Judges know that their decisions one way or the other are going to have life-altering impacts, either on the accused or on the person who brought the complaint before the justice system. The debate today should not diminish the important role that judges play in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053195">I also want to take time to acknowledge the Hon. Rona Ambrose, the previous interim leader of the Conservative Party, for the work that she did in the 42nd Parliament with her private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053196">I am happy to see that the government has brought the substance of that bill forward in this 43rd Parliament as Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>. Judging from the character of the speeches so far, there is unanimous agreement that this bill needs to be passed, perhaps not through all stages as quickly as we would like, but I have a strong feeling that after today's debate the justice committee will be getting to work on this bill in short order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053197">We are supportive of the intent behind Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, particularly its intention of ensuring that victims of sexual assault and gender-based violence have confidence in the judicial system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053198">We know that complainants in sexual assault cases are often provided with inadequate social supports. They receive inadequate information about the court process, and they are often confronted by a system that ignores their wishes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053199">We should acknowledge that Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> would not solve those problems. It is an important step, but there is an entire systemic approach we need to take to ensure that complainants of sexual assault are coming to a system that they can have confidence in. That confidence needs to be built, and there is still much work to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053200">We need a systemic review of the judicial system when it comes to sexual assault to stop survivors from being victimized, victim-blamed, not informed and very badly supported by policing and justice systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053201">The statistics underline this story. Statistics Canada estimates that only 5% of sexual assaults are reported to the police. We know that one in three women will experience sexual violence in her lifetime. For me that is a particularly personal statistic, given that I am the father of three daughters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053202">I do not want anyone to become one of those statistics, but that is a fact of life in our society. It is not limited just to women: We know that one in six men will experience sexual violence in his lifetime as well. In 82% of cases, the offender is known to the victim. We know that 28% of Canadians have said that they have experienced workplace sexual assault or violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053203">I got to know a transgender person in my riding very well over the previous campaign, and I know the courage it took for him to come forward and be a part of my campaign and to speak openly about the situation that transgender Canadians face in our country. They face nearly twice as much intimate partner violence in their lifetimes as women do, and that is an area that we definitely need to pay attention to as a society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053204">I also want to acknowledge that my Conservative friends have raised some concerns as to whether the scope of this bill could be expanded to include other areas that fall under federal jurisdiction, most notably the Parole Board of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053205">We have also seen that the actions of the Immigration and Refugee Board deserve some scrutiny. Perhaps that is something that the justice committee, in its wisdom, can take note of and ask the appropriate questions of the witnesses who come forward to offer their expertise on this particular bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6053206">I was a member of the 42nd Parliament and remember with great pride, back in 2017 when we were deliberating Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document>, that it was great to see the House move a unanimous consent motion in March of that year to get the bill referred to the status of women committee. The status of women committee did some good work on the bill. It had five meetings, heard from 25 witnesses and reported that bill back to the House with some slight amendments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053207">This is to assure members of the House that the hard work on this bill has been done. We have a lot of witness testimony in the record, and I hope the testimony heard at the status of women committee back in 2017 will inform the justice committee and that we can take note of that when the justice committee is doing its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053208">This bill seeks, through training seminars, to correct the problems I have noted through rearticulation to judicial candidates on the current standing of sexual assault laws, namely the principles of consent, conduct of sexual assault proceedings, and education regarding myths and stereotypes of sexual assault complainants. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053209">That is because we have seen a record, through the actions of various judges, that this training is sorely needed. We have seen it through their comments during court proceedings and through referrals in their judgments, but we would be mistaken if we were to pinpoint this problem entirely on judges. We know that the police themselves have a lot of work to do, and I know they are trying their best to achieve this, but we know from the complaints of victims that this work is ongoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053210">The Senate, when it received Bill <Document DbId="8783394" Type="4">C-337</Document> through its legal and constitutional affairs committee, did make some amendments. There was a lot of concern regarding the constitutionality of the bill. I understand that the government's version is much closer to, or a wholesale adoption of, what the Senate committee did to Bill C-337. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053211">I know there is this ongoing battle between the legislature, the Parliament of Canada, and our judicial branch. Sometimes they can come into conflict. I know that Michael Spratt, a noted lawyer in the Ottawa region, has written about his concerns with the current bill, but I also know that Professor Emmett Macfarlane has said that Parliament is well within its rights to be legislating in areas such as the Judges Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053212">I think this bill does a careful job, as is noted in the charter statement, of doing our best to respect judicial independence. This is really about setting up the training that exists. It is going to be overseen independently of Parliament. We will not have any influence whatsoever on what judges do with this training, because they are still going to be impartial and independent of Parliament when they exercise their judgment and bring forward rulings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053213">This bill, in particular, passes constitutional muster. I have read the wording of it quite carefully and I think Parliament has a role, as an expression of people's wishes and the changing norms of society, to express its will and make sure that the federal statutes of Canada reflect the changing mood of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053214">I would like to offer my congratulations to the government and all members for the unanimity that we are showing in the proceedings today. I think, though, that when we are looking at other issues plaguing Canada, particularly with respect to aboriginal rights, we still see a lot of systemic racism and very little understanding of what aboriginal rights and title mean. Sometimes this can be reflected in our federal court system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053215">In closing, my one offer to the government is that it look at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action, particularly number 27, to see if this kind of training might also be mandated for judges and other parts of the justice system that fall under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053231">Madam Speaker, I am grateful to have the opportunity to rise to speak to this issue. For me, like many Canadians, this is a deeply personal issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053232"> I am among the one in three women who has experienced sexual violence and I know first-hand how the shame, guilt and stigma still persist in addressing sexual assault. I have also witnessed close friends and community members go through the legal system and struggle in dealing with the misconceptions and prejudice from support workers, police, lawyers and judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053233"> Having witnessed the challenges survivors face in our judicial system, many choose not to report it. Only one out of 20 sexual assault victims report to the police. A key factor for that is the lack of confidence survivors have in the judicial system to treat them fairly and to achieve a positive outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053234">For those who choose to report to the police or to pursue charges, the judicial system is rigged against them. The fear many survivors have that they will not get fair treatment is real, and it is supported by the evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053235">There is a profound lack of trust in the legal system. Out of the estimated 460,000 sexual assaults each year in Canada, only three out of every thousand lead to a conviction. That is number is staggering: three out of 1,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053236">When it comes to sexual assault, it is clear that we need a systematic review of the judicial system to stop survivors from being victimized or victim-blamed, or not being informed or having reports systematically brushed aside and being badly supported by our policing and justice systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053237">The Canadian justice system in its current form actually discourages sexual assault survivors or survivors of gender-based violence from coming forward. This bill seeks to take a small but important step forward in correcting the problem through training and education of judicial candidates. These future judges would get training on the current standing of sexual assault laws, namely principles of consent, conduct of sexual assault proceedings and education regarding myths and stereotypes of sexual assault complaints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053238"> This is so important. It is a non-partisan issue. The last iteration of this bill passed unanimously in the House in the last Parliament, but was shamefully blocked by the unelected Senate. This is why the NDP agrees that legislation is needed to require judges to receive training around sexual assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053239">Without taking away from the importance of the bill, which is desperately needed, we also have to acknowledge that it is just one of the needed steps. Treating sexual assault as only a criminal justice issue ignores the fact that just one in 20 victims report it to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053240">Sexual assault is also a public health issue, a personal health and wellness issue and a mental health issue. We need to treat it as such by also turning our attention to medical services, support and care. Trauma-informed approaches and an increased understanding of sexual assault among key service providers and actors is critical. This includes judges, but also police, medical professionals, lawyers and support workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053241">I am also lucky to live in a riding where my constituents and I have the Victoria Sexual Assault Centre. I was lucky enough to be able to access its services when I needed them. It serves people of all genders. We know one in three women experience sexualized violence, but one in six men do as well. We know that non-binary and LGBTQ2I+ folks face disproportionate levels of sexualized violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053242">We are truly fortunate to have the Victoria Sexual Assault Centre since it is Canada's only integrated sexual assault clinic. The clinic provides survivors of all genders access to trauma-informed medical and forensic exams, police interviews and crisis support, all in one safe, accessible and culturally sensitive, confidential location. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6053243">The availability of this survivor-centred care means that the vast majority of survivors in my riding will never need to go to a hospital or police station to get the care they need. When the clinic opened, the number of emergency responses more than doubled, meaning twice as many survivors were able to access emotional support, preventative medication and options for police reporting. The number of supported police interviews rose by 400%. All of this took place while diverting 280 people from the emergency room and reducing costs for other service providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053244">However, the clinic has no dedicated or secure sources of funding. It relies entirely on one-time grants, and the service will be extremely vulnerable in the coming year and a half. The bill is a step in the right direction, but we also need to ensure that comprehensive support services are available for all survivors. There is so much work to do, and I am hopeful we can take this important small step forward quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053245">Judges need training to challenge the false stereotypes about sexual violence that permeate our society. We have seen too many appalling examples in recent years showing that some judges continue to hold false stereotypes about women and sexualized violence. These biases discourage all survivors from coming forward in the first place and create barriers for survivors who do so in seeking justice through the legal system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053246">Trauma is complex, and judges need to understand survivors' perspectives and the impact of the criminal justice system on survivors of sexual assault. The training needs to be culturally informed and relevant to the unique needs of vulnerable and marginalized populations. Some groups face disproportionately higher rates of sexual violence, and many groups face very specific barriers in seeking help from law enforcement agencies and the justice system. They include those from northern, rural and remote communities, sex workers, people who are trafficked, LGBTQ+ people, indigenous women, immigrant and refugee women and women with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053247">The bill could be improved at the justice committee by making sure that seminars related to sexual assault are developed in collaboration with these groups and by specifically bringing the bill within the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call to action no. 27. We can also ensure it is in line with the calls to action from the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053248">There is a clear benefit to ensuring that judges are well informed not only about the laws that pertain to sexual assault but also about the physical, mental and emotional impacts of sexual violence on survivors and how those affect decision-making, behaviour, ability to recall and so much more. Building confidence in our courts would make more victims feel empowered to come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053249">The message sent to survivors by the Senate when it refused to pass the bill in its former iteration in the last Parliament was dismissal, a dismissal of the idea that what happens to victims of sexual assault matters, a dismissal of survivor needs and a dismissal of the real barriers they encounter. This message is reinforced throughout our whole judicial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053250">Supporting this legislation sends a message to survivors that their elected members of Parliament are standing up for them and are committed to doing the work necessary to support them. We recognize the stigma and barriers they face and are working hard to give them a reason to have more confidence in our system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053256">I particularly appreciate that he talked about working across jurisdictions, because I think it is important that we work with our provincial and municipal partners to reduce stigma and support survivors in all cases.

              <ParaText id="6053257">Having a debate about the death of Marylène Levesque is a stark, horrific reminder. I think all Canadians would benefit from training and education on these issues. I would also invite the members of this House to do their own training. There is a lot of information out there. We need to come together in our communities, in our organizations and in every aspect of our world to support survivors. It is one in three women or one in six men, and those numbers are even higher for non-binary trans individuals. That means there are dozens of people in this House who have experienced sexualized violence. Our day-to-day interactions need to shift dramatically, but especially when survivors are reaching out for support or accessing services. When we are delivering services, we need to make sure they are done in trauma-informed and supportive ways.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053265">It is an honour for me to speak to Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>. As members know, if passed, this proposed piece of legislation will amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code to require newly appointed provincial superior court judges to participate in training on sexual assault and the social context in which it occurs. Judges are expected to apply the law in a manner that is respectful of the dignity of survivors. Training on sexual assault law and the social context in which the sexual assault occurs will help to ensure that they have a full understanding of the complex nature of sexual assault when presiding over such cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053266">This proposed legislation will also require judges to provide written reasons for their final decisions in sexual assault matters. Doing so will improve the transparency of judges' decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053267">It is noteworthy that only 5% of sexual assaults in this country get reported. Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> would give us an opportunity to strengthen our criminal justice system and give survivors of sexual assault and all Canadians more confidence in our system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053268">Today I will use my time to demonstrate how this legislation could build the confidence of survivors of sexual assault, as well as their families and loved ones, in our criminal justice system, and help survivors feel more comfortable in reporting these crimes to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053269">Sexual violence is a widespread problem in Canada. It is one of the most under-reported crimes. As I stated earlier, only 5% of sexual assaults in Canada are reported to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053270"> I would like to elaborate on the social context. Brampton, especially in my own riding of Brampton West, is one of the fastest-growing populations in Canada. More interestingly, the majority of Brampton's residents are visible minorities. Violence, whether it is sexual assault or other forms of domestic violence, is massively under-reported. Due to the stigma of sexual violence, racialized women are even more reluctant to seek help. This is even more true for indigenous girls and women, women with disabilities and LGBTQ2 community members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053271">Many factors can influence whether or not survivors will report that they have been sexually assaulted, such as the fear of being blamed or not being believed, concerns over retaliation from their attacker, anxiety of having their personal lives publicly judged and the fear of judicial error. These are just some of the factors and truths of the society we live in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053272">These factors are exacerbated in marginalized communities. Such barriers transcend but can also be compounded by intersectionalities of one's gender, age, class, disability and ethnicity. That is why the social context is so necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053273">Myths and stereotypes about sexual assaults are also dangerous and can have substantial negative impacts on whether a survivor will report. They also negatively impact whether there can be a trial that is fair to the accused, the victim and society at large.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053274">Undeniably, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system is one of the significant reasons that survivors do not come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053275">For those who do report the crime, they often tell us that they are re-traumatized by the process. As myths and stereotypes regarding sexual assault continue in the justice system, scrutiny about what the survivor did or did not do instead of the actions of the accused often determine the outcome of a case. This dehumanizing process, along with a lack of adequate supports and resources, can revictimize and further traumatize those who have experienced sexual violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053276"> In spite of the progress we have made, the criminal justice system is still a source of further distress and humiliation for survivors of sexual assault. Sexual violence is a crime that robs people of their choice, strips them of their bodily and sexual integrity and undermines their dignity and psychological well-being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053277">The impact of sexual assault is still not well understood in society, and rape myths are still common and persist throughout the justice system. For example, in today's society, there is a disturbing misguided belief that survivors of sexual violence often falsify sexual assault reports.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6053278">There is also a mistaken belief that sexual assault is just consensual sexual activity that “went too far” or “got out of hand”. There is a persistent myth that if it were a “real” sexual assault, the survivor would have fought back or tried to get away. There is a misconception that a survivor should be able to recount every detail in a linear and organized sequence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053279">Neuroscience research about trauma provides evidence that what might appear to be an inconsistency in a way a victim reacts or how the victim recounts the incident can actually be a typical, predictable and normal way of responding to and coping with a traumatic event. Understanding this can change the way we view the person's credibility and reliability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053280">Thankfully, we are now starting to have a better scientific and psychological understanding of the different reactions that survivors have to traumatic events like sexual assault, including the impact of trauma on behaviour and memory. We also now understand that intergenerational trauma is a very real consequence of violence, which not only hurts individuals and their families, but also impacts communities as a whole. That is why training and awareness can help us to be fairer and more consistent in understanding how survivors react in sexual assault cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053281">Navigating the criminal justice system can be extremely difficult for survivors of sexual assault. They must feel confident that they will be treated fairly and with dignity. With education and training on sexual assault and the social context in which it occurs, as well as its impact on survivors, we can help build a better criminal justice system in which people feel more confident in reporting sexual assaults and stay engaged throughout the criminal justice process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053282">Sexual assault is a form of gender-based violence and is one of the most under-reported crimes in Canada. With Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, we are building on our federal investments to prevent and address gender-based violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053283">In 2017, we launched It's Time, Canada's strategy to prevent and address gender-based violence. This is the first strategy of its kind. It invests over $200 million in federal initiatives to prevent gender-based violence, support survivors and their families, and promote responsive legal and justice systems. Today, Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> forms part of the larger response to the issue of gender-based violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053284">Judges are trained to be impartial and unbiased and to have a thorough understanding of the law. Given that they are the individuals responsible for delivering justice, it is in everyone's interest to fill any gaps in their training. Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> would make it mandatory for all newly appointed provincial superior court judges to participate in continuing education in sexual assault law and social context. This will help ensure the superior court judges have a full understanding of the complex nature of sexual assault when presiding over such cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053285">Canadians need to have confidence that the judge in front of them is not influenced by myths and stereotypes in the judge's application of the law and that the judge understands the impacts of the trauma. Survivors also need to have confidence that the decision rendered in their case will be well reasoned and not influenced by biases and misconceptions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053286">This bill would help us move toward a higher level of confidence we must achieve. It would help empower women to work toward alleviating institutional oppression faced by women, including indigenous women, racialized women and women with disabilities, as well as members of the LGBTQ2 community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053287">I strongly encourage all members of this House to recognize the importance of Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> and to support it. Together we can continue to strengthen Canada's criminal justice system and give survivors of sexual assault and all Canadians more confidence in our justice system. Let us seize the opportunity to create a safer and more responsive justice system for all those who have experienced sexual violence and provide a better future for families, communities and all Canadians.</ParaText>

When I was a front-line worker, we would often say that fewer than 6% of survivors came forward, and today we have heard in the House the statistic of 5%, and so we know that this crime is truly under-reported. Unfortunately, gender-based violence is one of the most pervasive and deeply rooted human rights violations of our time, and we have to remember that it is 100% preventable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053311">I would like to talk about the Government of Canada's coordinated efforts to prevent and address gender-based violence, because Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> is another important piece of a larger suite of initiatives designed to better support survivors and their families, as well as to promote a responsive legal justice system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053313">Gender-based violence is violence directed towards another person based on their gender identity, gender expression or perceived gender. Gender-based violence is linked to gender inequities, unequal power dynamics and harmful gender norms and behaviours. It is made worse by other forms of discrimination.</ParaText>

Transgender, two-spirit and gender-diverse people in Canada also experience higher rates of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053315">In Canada, gender-based violence continues to happen at an extremely alarming rate. According to data collected by Statistics Canada, between 2008 and 2018, over 700 women were killed by their intimate partner in this country. In 2018, one in every three women experienced unwanted sexual behaviour in public. While these numbers are terrifying, the reality for indigenous women and girls is even worse. In 2018, the rate of homicide was nearly seven times higher for indigenous women and girls than for their non-indigenous counterparts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053316">Faced with such a bleak picture, the government took action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053317">In 2017, the Government of Canada took action, launching the very first federal strategy to prevent and address gender-based violence entitled “Canada's Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053318">The strategy includes over $200 million for federal initiatives to prevent gender-based violence, support survivors and their families, and promote responsive legal and justice systems.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053319">The gender-based violence strategy is the first-ever federal strategy of its kind because it takes a whole-of-government approach and is informed by grassroots activism and feminist action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053320">We listened to survivors and women's and equality-seeking organizations in communities across the country that are working tirelessly to address gender-based violence within their communities. Let me give some examples of the initiatives under the strategy that were informed by their voices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053321"> As a part of the strategy, the Public Health Agency of Canada, also known as PHAC, is investing more than $40 million over five years and more than $9 million per year ongoing. This includes investing in initiatives that prevent child maltreatment and teen and youth dating violence, and equip health professionals to respond to gender-based violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053322"> For example, the Public Health Agency of Canada is funding projects through which young Canadians learn how to develop and maintain healthy relationships that are free from violence and abuse. Educators are also provided with new tools to increase their capacity to deliver this type of guidance to young Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053323">Teaching teenagers across Canada about what a healthy relationship looks like also helps foster positive relationships, changes attitudes and promotes gender equality. It helps foster a greater understanding, ultimately resulting in a safer community for young Canadians anywhere in Canada from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053324">In addition, the Public Health Agency of Canada is investing more than $6 million per year to support the health of survivors of family violence. Improving physical and mental health outcomes for youth and children, helping mothers experiencing family violence learn the impact of violence on their parenting and their children's development, while building mothers' self-esteem and improving their positive parenting and healthy relationship skills, and building resilience and life skills in young women are just some examples of what the funded projects aim to accomplish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053325">Just as Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> proposes to train judges, under the strategy we are training RCMP front-line officers so that they can better understand the social context surrounding gender-based violence. The goal is for survivors to feel more confident in moving forward to denounce their aggressors and for officers to be more understanding of the survivors' situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053326">These are just a few examples that demonstrate the ongoing progress of the strategy.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053327">As part of the strategy, we are working in close co-operation with every level of government, including the provincial and territorial governments, as well as several departments and organizations. We are pooling our resources to strengthen our ability to support those affected by gender-based violence in communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053328">We are working on establishing a national plan that would ensure that anyone facing gender-based violence is protected and has reliable and timely access to services, no matter where they live.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6053329">In closing, I could continue discussing our accomplishments and the continuous efforts we are making. The point is that Canada's strategy to prevent gender-based violence is moving forward because we know there is still more work that needs to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053330">We need to give Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> our full support. We are counting on all members of Parliament to help us continue this crucial work to end gender-based violence within our communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053352">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this House today to discuss a question I asked a few weeks ago of the <Affiliation DbId="246259" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053353"> The reality is that last year there was an NDP motion put forward in the House by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252992" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation>, who proposed that when we look at the reality of so many veterans in our country, we want to make sure to support them the best way we know how, and the best way to do that is to make sure that any unspent resources at the end of the fiscal year would move forward into the next fiscal year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053354"> That motion was voted on in this House and actually was one, happily, that was voted on unanimously. It was good to see support from all members for the veterans who have served our country. The motion was voted on positively, but sadly, the implementation was not carried out. In fact, last year $381 million was not spent on veterans as it should have been, in my opinion. I believe that the veterans of this country who served us so fearlessly deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053355">The minister answered the question that I asked by saying, “benefits are demand-driven”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053356">Then on February 10, multiple articles came out, letting Canadians know that there were 44,000 veterans waiting on information about their disability benefits. That list of veterans at the end of September 2019 showed a 10% increase from six months earlier. It was quite a startling number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053357">We know, because veterans have told us, that long delays are stressful. To change these delays, it seems to me that more resources are needed for things like finding staff who can actually help deliver these services so that those backlogs do not become so long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053358">What was interesting to me is that the minister, when interviewed on this particular fact, said in one article:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053359">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Of course I always want more money. But what we have to do is deal with the money that we have and make sure we put the system together as efficiently as possible. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053360">The minister said that he would always want more money. There was a motion in the House saying that if there were unspent dollars at the end of the fiscal year, we would forward them and put them into the next year's fiscal year. That was the NDP motion, and we all voted for it in this House unanimously. Then we realized that the 2018-19 allotment for Veterans Affairs was actually $127 million less than the year before, and at the end of that same 2018-19 period, over $100 million was left unspent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053361"> The veterans ombudsman's report stated very clearly that issues about wait times are the single greatest complaint that they receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053362">Today I am here to ask the question again: Why are the resources promised to veterans not being forwarded, and when will action be taken?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053363">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for bringing up an issue that is very important not only to me and our government but to all Canadians: the well-being of our veterans, members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053364">The House supported the motion in 2018 to end lapsed funding. We all want to ensure that veterans and their families have access to the supports and services they need when they need them. The well-being of veterans is a top priority for me and our government. That is why we are committed to doing more to support veterans and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053365">Our benefits are demand-driven. No matter how many veterans come forward, when eligible, they will receive their benefits. The process guarantees that whenever veterans come forward, whether it is this year, next year or beyond, they will receive those benefits. The resources are there for them at all times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053366">Over 90% of Veterans Affairs' budget goes to funding veterans programs and benefits. Every day, over $5 million in disability benefits goes to veterans. Last year alone, we spent $4.4 billion directly on benefits and services for veterans, their families and other eligible recipients. This is $1 billion more than the former Conservative government. This year, we expect to spend approximately $5 billion directly on services and benefits for our veterans. Changing how we account for lapsed funding will not change that or our priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053367">The veterans community is evolving and expanding along with its needs. Veterans Affairs is evolving too. For example, we opened 10 offices to provide better services, face to face, to veterans and their families. These offices were closed by the former Conservative government. We increased the amount of benefits provided to veterans with service-related injuries and illnesses. We introduced pension for life as an option for them. We also introduced eight new and enhanced initiatives to better support a seamless transition to life after service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053368">Our evolution in services and benefits and our success in reaching veterans and their families has led to a significant increase in volume. Disability benefit applications alone rose from 29,000 in 2015 to 54,000 last year, which is an increase of almost double. To respond to this increased demand, Veterans Affairs has increased its program budget. This guarantees that no matter how many veterans come forward or when, they will receive the benefits and services they are entitled to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053369"> It is worthwhile to note that last year 98% of the estimated funds available was spent to support veterans and their families with the benefits and services they needed. The remaining 2% that the hon. member has identified provides VAC the required flexibility to ensure that sufficient funding is available to support all veterans who are approved for those benefits. Therefore, there has been no impact on our commitment to helping veterans or on the ability of the department to deliver the services required.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053371">I would not disagree in any way that the Conservatives did not support veterans in the way they had demanded. That was something I witnessed. However, the reality is that the new government, which keeps comparing itself to the last government, has still not hired back the right number of people to do the work, those the Conservatives removed. It is definitely something the lapsed money could help out with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053372">There are 44,000 veterans on the wait-list for disability benefits. We are hearing from the government that they should not worry because they will receive their benefits. However, the question is, when? Why is this process taking so long?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053373"> I hope the government will take this seriously, treat veterans a bit better and look at the opportunity provided by the motion that was in the House to make sure that lapsed spending is given back to this particular group that needs it so desperately, especially when the wait-lists are very long.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053378">Every day, in parts of my community, there is a reminder of just how bad this crisis has become. It is a big-city problem that has moved to small communities. When I look at the work of the RCMP and various front-line service organizations, I see that we are very much at a breaking point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053379">If we look nationwide, nearly 14,000 people have now died from the opioid crisis. More than 17,000 people have been hospitalized as a result of this mounting crisis. In my own riding, in the 2018-2019 year, we had 26,683 client visits, representing 316 unique individuals. There were 170 overdoses recorded. More than a third of the total unique users were youth who were aged 15 to 24, and of this group, 75% are indigenous and 20% have complex needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053380">First responders, overdose prevention facilities and emergency rooms have all endured massive costs, both monetary and emotional, because front-line service workers are experiencing high rates of burnout. This burnout means that we cannot recruit the people who are needed. It was actually nearly four years ago that B.C.'s medical health officer declared a public health emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053381">What I am asking today is that the federal government finally take note of this crisis, declare it a national health emergency and start giving communities like mine the assistance they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053382">The other thing we need is for the federal government to take a leadership role and start tackling this crisis with innovative measures, such as decriminalization of possession of small amounts. It is time to stop using the criminal justice system to tackle a social problem and a health problem. We have to stop criminalizing people whose only crime is being addicted to drugs. They do not need the justice system. They do not need jail time. They need social services. They need health services. We need a federal government that is prepared to show the courage to bring in those types of measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053383">The stigma associated with criminalization prevents many of these people from getting the help they need. Canada need only look to jurisdictions like Portugal, which in 2001 decriminalized small possession amounts and has shown an amazing turnaround. It has gone from a country that used to have one of the highest overdose death rates in all of Europe to a country with one of the lowest ones, where now people who are addicted to drugs are encouraged to come and get the help they need without fear of retribution from the criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053384">Finally, in closing, another point is that the government has to start getting serious about providing a safe supply of drugs. It is the tainted street supply of drugs that is causing all of this death and destruction, and the longer we ignore this issue, the longer it is going to continue. This is causing huge amounts of damage, not only in the number of deaths but also in the survivors, such as people who have to deal with lifelong brain injuries as a result. Let us think about what the cost will be. It is being borne by families, by members of my community, by small business owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053385"> I am asking the federal government to take a look at those three things: declaring a national health emergency, decriminalizing small possession amounts, and making sure we have a safe supply so that we take leadership on this crisis and deliver the help that communities like mine actually need.</ParaText>

He truly cares, and I want to thank him, not only for that passion and compassion, but also for the fact that he truly cares.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053387">We are deeply concerned about Canada's opioid overdose crisis. New data released in December show that from January 2016 to June 2019, 13,913 people across this country have died as the result of opioid overdoses. While this number is staggering, we must not lose sight of the fact that this crisis impacts many more people than are reflected in the statistics. Each death affects families, friends, communities and loved ones, creating a loss felt by tens of thousands of people. This crisis is impacting all Canadians and is a national public health crisis of the highest priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053388">This tragedy involves many factors; however, we know that the vast majority of overdose deaths are caused by illegally produced, highly toxic synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil. The introduction of these substances into Canada's illegal drug market corresponds with the steep rise in overdose deaths. Therefore, an important element in our response to the crisis must be to address the smuggling of these toxic opioids into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053389">We have responded by enacting new legislation, fast-tracking regulatory action, making investments and working collaboratively with other countries to prevent the smuggling of illicit drugs from countries like China. Prior to amendments to the Customs Act under Bill <Document DbId="8689350" Type="3">C-37</Document>, CBSA officers did not have the authority to inspect international packages weighing 30 grams or less without consent from the sender or addressee. For context, one 30-gram package can contain enough fentanyl to kill 15,000 people. Today, officers now have the authority to open any incoming package when they have reasonable grounds. We have also put in place scheduling amendments to restrict importation of chemicals used to produce fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances illegally. Additionally, our government has provided up to an additional $76.2 million to address the opioid crisis and problematic substance use, bringing the total recent investment to more than $100 million, including $30.5 million from budget 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053390">Because illegal drug trafficking knows no borders, international co-operation is also essential. Canada is working closely with international partners to prevent fentanyl and carfentanil from entering our country. Nowhere is our partnership stronger than with the United States. In fact, last June, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and President Trump reconfirmed our shared desire to address the overdose crisis ravaging Canada and the United States by committing to a joint action plan. Both countries are also working with the Chinese government to address the issue of illicitly produced fentanyl. The Government of Canada welcomed China's recent efforts to disrupt the illegal trafficking of fentanyl, as well as its addition of fentanyl-related substances to its supplementary list of controlled narcotics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053391">Enforcement to reduce the illegal drug supply is, however, just one component of our government's approach. If we are to turn the tide on this tragedy, we must commit to saving lives and supporting people who use drugs, and to improving their health and well-being. That is why our government restored harm reduction as a pillar of the Canadian drugs and substances strategy, approved more than 40 supervised consumption sites across the country, made naloxone available without a prescription and provided $150 million through the emergency treatment fund to provinces and territories to improve access to evidence-based substances and treatment services. A further $106.7 million was provided in budget 2019, which includes funding for pilot projects focused on pharmaceutical alternatives to the illegal drug market.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053400">Madam Speaker, so-called Canadian mining companies are destroying our nation's reputation around the world. The horrific impact of these companies is neither new nor surprising, given the lack of accountability of so-called Canadian companies when it comes to upholding human rights, labour rights and environmental rights in countries in which they operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053401">Companies flying the Canadian flag choose to work in countries where the rule of law is weak, democracy is fragile, respect for human rights is tenuous, corruption can be rampant and accountability is non-existent. The absence of regulatory and institutional systems allows these mining companies to take advantage of these fragile and unstable countries, and vulnerable people suffer because of it. We have seen, over and over again, that these companies are allowed to operate in ways favourable to their bottom line while preventing the investigation of the human rights violations they perpetrate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053402">Two-thirds of the world's mining firms are currently incorporated in Canada. Can we imagine why that is? We have such lax oversight of these companies that, whether they are Canadian or not, they are incorporated here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053403">For far too long, we have allowed companies flying the Canadian flag to operate in developing countries without any accountability for serious human rights and environmental rights violations. Despite the government's claims, we are not protecting the most vulnerable populations and we are not holding these companies to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053404">The late NDP member of Parliament, Paul Dewar, worked tirelessly, fighting for human rights in Canada and around the world. Paul demanded an ombudsman over a decade ago and the NDP has been fighting for this position ever since. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053405">Finally in 2018, the Liberal government created the ombudsman for responsible enterprise to oversee Canadian mining, oil and gas operations around the world. The ombudsman was mandated to review alleged human rights abuses arising from Canadian companies' operations abroad, make recommendations, monitor those recommendations, suggest trade measures for companies that do not co-operate in good faith, and report publicly throughout the process. This is not what is happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053406">The Liberal government promised an independent ombudsperson with real powers to investigate abuses and redress harms caused by companies that fly the Canadian flag. Instead the powers of the ombudsman were watered down and the promises made by the government have not been kept. In fact, it is business as usual. Once again, the government has said all the right things but has done nothing to actually ensure accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053407">I have worked in international development for over 20 years and I have witnessed first-hand the profoundly damaging impacts that Canadian mining companies have abroad. I have stood in Nicaragua in front of a fence that says “go home Canada”. I have spoken to mothers who have to give their children poisoned water because that is all they have. Mining companies flying the Canadian flag have poisoned the aquifer on which their communities depend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053408">I have been to Nicaragua, Peru and Ecuador. I have seen what has happened when we are not able to hold Canadian companies to account. I have seen how vulnerable people are impacted when these mining companies move in, their resources are pulled out, their environment is irreparably damaged and the communities are left to suffer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6053409">Independent and respected organizations like Amnesty International and the United Nations have identified widespread abuses by Canadian companies. Those include targeted assassinations, gang rape, violence against unarmed protesters and the use of slave labour. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053414">Responsible business conduct is not the same as corporate social responsibility, for it goes beyond a philanthropic approach. Rather, it requires businesses to take action to prevent and deal with any negative repercussions they create. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6053416">Canada's approach to responsible business conduct includes both preventative measures and dispute resolution mechanisms, namely the Canadian ombudsman for responsible enterprise and the national contact point for the OECD guidelines for multinationals.</ParaText>
