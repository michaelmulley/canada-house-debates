            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252566" Type="2">Mr. Damien Kurek (Battle River—Crowfoot, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6017715">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to stand in the House for the first time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017716">Before I get into what will be a list of people I want to thank, I would like to reflect for a moment on when my wife and I flew here for the first time after the election for one of the orientation days. Although I had been to this chamber and to the chamber in Centre Block many times, it was an incredible experience to walk onto the floor of this House, the very epicentre of Canadian democracy, to see that so clearly demonstrated through the traditions represented, the desks, the very carpet, and all that that means. It truly is a humbling experience, the burden that all 338 of us have as we sit here representing people from across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017717">Danielle and I took a few moments and reflected on the significance of what that means in our nation's more than 150-year history. The phrase that kept coming to mind, which I repeated often throughout the election, was the short statement in section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, regarding the House of Commons and making laws “for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017718">Although it talks primarily about delegated authority, over these last seven to eight months I spent a lot of time campaigning and talking with Canadians, the people of Battle River—Crowfoot. I thought time and time again the prime reason we are here is to ensure that we have peace, order and good governance. Each and every one of us has that responsibility in representing our many constituents in the diverse regions that make up this country and that we all work toward that in the midst of what often will be differences, sometimes passionate differences, on policy items. As we work in a unique minority Parliament there has to be a level of working together to some degree, while we all strive for peace, order and good government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017719">I would be remiss if I did not list a few of the people I wish to thank. I will get to the people of Battle River—Crowfoot in a minute, but I first I need to thank my family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017720">My wife Danielle is an amazing life partner. I thank her for the support she has given over these last eight months in the adventure of a nomination campaign and now during the early months as a member of Parliament. I thank Danielle so much. I am also very proud of my two boys, Matthew and Emerson, who are excited that dad gets to now work in a castle. They are a little young to understand the dynamics of it, but they like the fact that I work in a castle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017721">I thank my dad, siblings, aunts and uncles. When one comes from a farming family, one has a real understanding of the significance of what family is in a situation like this, and I thank my family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017722"> I want to especially mention my late grandfathers, Jim Hutchings and Felix Kurek, who, throughout their lives, were such an encouragement to me. They were both very different people, but they demonstrated so well what it is to be Canadian and all that it represents. My grandfather Felix had a career in the energy industry. My grandfather Jim was a career farmer and demonstrated well what it is to be Canadian. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017723">I thank my campaign team. By the end of the campaign, we had more than 200 people who participated in the nomination and election campaigns. It was incredible to have all of these people involved in the democratic process, and I thank my campaign team.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6017724">I would also like to thank my office staff, some of whom I have worked with before and some of whom are new, for their hard work, support and effort, especially over these last weeks as I have been learning the ropes as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017725">I want to also thank my predecessor Kevin Sorenson. Kevin demonstrated well what it is to be a strong representative with a principled voice for east central Alberta. He is a principled, good guy. I appreciate Kevin's friendship and his mentorship. I am glad that he is still quick to offer me advice, even though I am now the one sitting in the chamber and he is farming and taking some well-deserved rest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017726">I want to talk about the people of Battle River—Crowfoot, and my response to the throne speech and the amendment that our Conservative caucus has brought forward. They go hand in hand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017727">I am a fifth-generation farmer from the constituency of Battle River—Crowfoot. Over the last seven or eight months I have spoken to over 10,000 people who are faced with the reality of the country in which we live. I need to first thank them for the honour of representing them with a strong mandate in this House. I will be their voice in Parliament, making sure that the concerns, the issues and all that makes up Battle River—Crowfoot, that 52,000 square kilometres of east central Alberta, get represented in our capital. I take that seriously. I thank them again for this honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017728">As I have travelled over these last eight months, and as I have continued connecting with the people in Battle River—Crowfoot since the election, I have heard a consistent message. They are frustrated and they are not content with our country's status. As a proud Canadian, that is difficult to hear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017729">We have heard a number of speeches from some of my colleagues that have touched on this, but the level of alienation that we are hearing about is real. I would urge members opposite to take seriously the fact that there are lifelong proud Canadians who feel their country is not serving them. That is a problem and something that needs to be acknowledged. Unfortunately, it was not acknowledged in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017730">I have spoken with energy workers, people who have made a career in the oil and gas sector, who have given up hope. These people are proud of the work they do, including the world-class environmental standards that they work hard to preserve each and every day. They were not recognized. They need champions, yet unfortunately, the throne speech does not even acknowledge them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017731">I have spoken with the agricultural industry. As a fifth-generation farmer, I am proud of that legacy. Farmers are stewards of the land in Alberta's special areas, yet producers have faced devastating consequences. Let me outline what that might look like for a producer, a farmer. Farmers are facing a drop in the price of canola from $13 a bushel to $9 a bushel. That has a devastating impact on a farmer's bottom line in an industry that already has very slim margins. We did not see those issues addressed in the throne speech. However, the government seems to brag about its relationship on the international stage when it is literally being laughed at on late night television.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017732"> I talked to other business owners and people within my constituency. They are all so close to giving up hope. That is devastating for a proud Canadian, whether it be workers in manufacturing, or whether it be those teachers, nurses, doctors in our small communities. If they do not have strong communities, those institutions cannot thrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017733">My speaking time is nearly done and I look forward to answering questions. I would simply conclude by saying once again that I am so honoured to be the member of Parliament for Battle River—Crowfoot. I thank God for this country. It is such an honour to be able to participate in this democratic process and all that it means for the future of Battle River—Crowfoot and this nation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017734">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Battle River—Crowfoot and welcome him to the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017735">I heard him speak about energy workers, and certainly in my riding of Burnaby North—Seymour, I have talked about the plight of energy workers in Alberta. In fact, since my riding is at the end of the Trans Mountain pipeline that is starting construction, we can hear the pile-driving happening from my house. It is happening right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017736"> We have had over 500 days of protest in my riding over the last four years that I have been a member of Parliament. Now that TMX is under construction, will the member support meeting our climate change targets and support the other underlying issues that my constituents are concerned about? Will he support the oceans protection plan and support making sure we have a world-class oil spill response? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017737">Most importantly, will the member support the residents of Burnaby Mountain, which is getting an expanded tank farm 600 metres from an elementary school, next to tens of thousands of students at SFU and a growing community at university?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017738">As well, will the member support the Burnaby firefighters to make sure that the investments are made so that we have world-class facilities to keep those people safe?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017739">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to being able to answer the question, but I would premise it by saying this: I have constituents who are developing world-class spill response technology, yet they can't even get a meeting with the minister from the other side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017740"> The Liberals talk about wanting to care about the environment when we have an energy industries and energy investment fleeing this country each and every day. Canada is a world leader in sustainable, environmentally friendly energy production. I see it every day. The people within my constituency are proud that they are on the cutting edge of that, yet the government has all but abandoned them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017741">I hope that pipeline gets built. Its terminus, I understand, is in the constituency of the member who asked the question. However, it needs to be understood that this pipeline is among the others that the Liberals have either abandoned or cancelled, or whatever the case may be. We even saw this morning an announcement that more energy investment, at first slated for Canada, is being used in the Gulf of Mexico. That is an abandonment of Canadian energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017742">We need to make sure that we support the world-class industry that we have here in this country, including the environmental industry. I hope that pipeline gets built, but quite frankly, with the record of the members opposite, until oil starts flowing through it, I do not believe it for a second.</ParaText>

Our regions are experiencing these problems mainly because of the rather early snow this year. The first snowfall was about three weeks earlier than usual, which may be attributable to climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017745">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to being able to answer the question. In the member's constituency there are producers who are facing unpredictable weather patterns and whatnot that are affecting their yields, and the case is the same in many places across the country. We need to make sure that there are strong supports for our agricultural sectors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017753">I would like to begin by thanking the people of Don Valley North for placing their trust in me to be their voice in Ottawa. I am incredibly humbled by this great responsibility, and I will strive every day to ensure that the perspectives, concerns and diverse opinions and beliefs of my community are thoughtfully and comprehensively represented in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017754">Throughout this fall's campaign, just like all of my hon. colleagues, I had the chance to speak to residents through the breadth and width of my riding about issues they cared most about, from traffic congestion and community safety to housing affordability and providing more support for our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017755">The residents of Don Valley North and Canadians from coast to coast to coast have made it very clear. They asked all of us in this House to work together to address the issues that matter most to them and their families, and they expect us to deliver results not soon, not down the road, but now. That is why I am proud of the ambitious agenda this government has presented to the House in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017756">This government has set forward a plan to address the most pressing issues faced by us as a society today. These include fighting climate change, strengthening the middle class, walking the road of reconciliation, keeping Canadians safe and healthy and positioning our country for success on the international stage. Canadians have chosen to keep our country moving forward, and that is exactly what this government's plan will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017757">While I stand in this House speaking of the mandate handed to us by the Canadian people, my mind turns immediately to an encounter I had on the campaign trail in Don Valley North. While knocking on doors on Van Horne Avenue, I met a young mother completing her final year of post-secondary studies. Although beaming with pride as she told me about her daughter and how much she has accomplished over the years in the face of adversity and challenges, I could see her eyes slowly begin to fill with tears. She told me about her anxieties with regard to the possibility of not being able to complete her studies because of recent cuts to the new OSAP funding by the current provincial government.

              <ParaText id="6017789">Mr. Speaker, since this is my first opportunity to speak in this 43rd Parliament, I would like to start by congratulating you on your election as Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017790">I would also like to thank the residents of Oakville North—Burlington for the confidence they have placed in me to represent them once again in this place. I would like to thank my son Fraser and his wife Taylor for their love and support, and my family, Jill, Rob and their son Bayley, as well as my incredible staff and campaign team, without whom I would not be here. I am incredibly proud of the work done over the last four years, and I am excited to continue that work in this new Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017791">During the campaign, I had many conversations with constituents about their expectations for this new Parliament. They, along with all Canadians, expect us to work together as parliamentarians to make sure that we build an economy that leaves no one behind, take decisive action on climate change, make life more affordable, continue down the road to reconciliation and ensure that the health and safety of Canadians remains our number one priority through action on gun control and universal national pharmacare. The throne speech affirmed our commitment to delivering on those priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017792">The residents of Oakville North—Burlington are passionate about green space, the environment and fighting climate change. During the campaign, I met with the group Grandmothers Act to Save the Planet and others who want to see us take urgent action to save the planet. Two weeks ago, I attended a climate strike in Burlington organized by Caleb Smolenaars, a student in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017793">Climate change is the defining challenge of our time, which is why we are taking bold, decisive action. In my riding, we have made investments in Oakville Transit, Burlington Transit and GO Transit so that service can be improved and people can get home faster. We have also invested in the Crosstown Trail and other walking and cycling infrastructure. We are offering incentives to get more people to use zero-emission vehicles. I have long advocated for better cycling infrastructure. Cycling is the ultimate zero-emission vehicle, and I will continue to work with the government and stakeholders to further advance cycling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017794">While we have taken action by introducing a price on pollution, there is much more work to be done. We are setting a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, protecting and conserving nature and reducing plastic pollution. Not long ago I challenged local restaurants to stop using plastic straws, and today I am pleased that most restaurants have stopped serving plastic straws automatically. Halton has some of the safest drinking water in Canada, so there is no need for plastic water bottles, yet we still have much work to do to reduce our plastic use in our everyday lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017795">In our last mandate, we took steps to foster a renewed relationship with indigenous peoples and deliver a better life for families and communities, but there remains much work to be done. We will take action to co-develop and introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We will continue our work on eliminating long-term drinking water advisories on reserve by 2021 and will co-develop legislation to ensure that indigenous peoples have access to high-quality and culturally relevant health care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017796">In 2012, I visited the hospital in Sioux Lookout, a partnership between federal, provincial, municipal and first nation governments. This hospital provides culturally appropriate treatment and care, hospice and long-term stay care and a wraparound continuum of care that ensures better health outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017797">We must also address the recommendations of the report on missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and continue to implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations. I am happy to see that in my community we are working with the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, indigenous knowledge keepers like Stephen Paquette and Sherry Saevil, and the Sheridan College Centre for Indigenous Learning and Support and Elijah Williams to advance reconciliation. Today, the Mississaugas of the Credit flag flies permanently at Oakville Town Hall. The Oakville Community Foundation and Oak Park Neighbourhood Centre are working with indigenous leaders to move us forward on the path to reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017798">As a government, the health and safety of Canadians is our number one priority. Thoughts and prayers are not enough when it comes to gun violence. In my role on the public safety committee during the last Parliament, I worked with my colleagues, as well as stakeholders like PolySeSouvient, the Coalition For Gun Control, Dr. Alan Drummond and emergency room physicians and many others to strengthen our firearms legislation. I am proud of my work on Bill <Document DbId="9710291" Type="3">C-71</Document> last year to introduce amendments to protect those subjected to intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6017799">During the election campaign, I was proud to run on our record of responsible firearms legislation and investments in law enforcement, border services, and programs that prevent young people from getting involved in guns and gangs. The action proposed in the throne speech to ban military-style assault weapons, like the one used at Polytechnique 30 years ago, is long overdue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017800"> We are the only country that has universal health care that does not have pharmacare as part of it. As former parliamentary secretary to the minister of health, I was able to work with the minister to make significant changes that will see the cost of drugs reduced for Canadians. No one should have to decide between putting food on the table and taking medication.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017801">We know that women are disproportionately impacted by the high cost of drugs because of the precarious nature of their work. I have heard stories of women who stopped taking beta blockers after a heart attack because they could not afford them and women who stay with an abusive partner simply for the drug plan that covers the expensive medications they need. This is unacceptable. That is why our move to a universal national pharmacare program is welcome news for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017802">Too many Canadians have been touched by cancer. Certainly one of the highlights of my first term was the $150-million investment the Canadian government will be making in the Terry Fox Research Institute to create the marathon of hope cancer centres with its partners. Through my volunteer work with the Terry Fox Foundation, I have had the pleasure of getting to know Dr. David Malkin and his work at SickKids with Terry Fox PROFYLE.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017803">Cancer remains the number one disease killer of children. During this term, I will honour children like Carson, Ayverie and Teagan, who were taken far too young by this horrible disease, and support the work of Helena's Hope to ensure that our platform commitment to fund childhood cancer research is honoured.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017804">Oakville North—Burlington is an affluent community, but that does not mean there are not those who struggle to make ends meet or who live in poverty. We must make sure we have an economy that works for all Canadians, including the most marginalized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017805">Affordability is an issue in my community. I have had the pleasure of working with Habitat for Humanity Halton-Mississauga, which has said that our national housing strategy has been transformative for its work. Recently, Affordable Housing Halton held an event where Andrew Balahura from the Halton region talked about the work it is doing, with the help of our federal government, to support those who need a safe, affordable place to live. We must also ensure that young people can buy their first home. That is why the proposed changes to the first-time homebuyers program will make a difference in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017806"> Ford Motor Company of Canada's assembly plant and head office in Oakville are of vital importance to Oakville and the surrounding area. It will be critical to ensure its success, not just today but in the future. Small and medium-sized businesses are the drivers of our Canadian economy and we will continue to provide an environment for them to grow and create well-paying middle-class jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017807">Gender equality and ending gender-based violence remain a top priority for me personally and for our government. I have had the privilege of working with some incredible local and national organizations, like Halton Women's Place, SAVIS, CAGIS, Actua and many more. I look forward to continuing our work. I am pleased to be launching the young women in leadership program shortly, which my team and I developed three years ago to give young women career mentors in Halton. The number-one obstacle to the full participation of women in the workplace is the lack of affordable quality child care. Ensuring that women have access to child care continues to be a priority for our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017808">Recently, I had the opportunity to attend the Nairobi Summit, reaffirming Canada's commitment to the agenda of the International Conference on Population and Development. I heard time and again that other countries look to Canada's leadership when it comes to empowering women, ending gender-based violence and poverty, realizing gender equality and taking urgent and sustained action to realize sexual and reproductive health and rights for all women at home and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017809">Canadians are expecting us to listen and collaborate on the many issues where there is common ground between us. It is a rare privilege to take a seat in this place, and one that I do not take for granted. I look forward to getting to work and I appreciate the opportunity to speak today.</ParaText>

We know that straw exchanges are being made, when firearms purchased by one individual are then illegally transferred to another.

I see nothing in the throne speech with regard to these elements, with regard to looking after our border and the safety and security of Canadians, with regard to making sure that straw purchases are not being made and with regard to reinforcing front-line policing and ensuring that gangs are taken off the streets.

I think young people are pushing governments at all levels to take action on this, because we do not have a lot of time left. Our government will be planting two billion trees, because we know that planting trees is an important component of reducing the emissions in the air. It is so critical. I look at my son and think about what kind of world I want all of us to leave for him. Certainly, action on climate change is important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017824">I look forward to working with the hon. member and members of his party in the House to make sure we are taking the action we need on climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017826">Though I rose briefly during Routine Proceedings last Friday, this is my first speech in the 43rd Parliament and I would like to take this occasion to give some additional words of thanks. As a temporary custodian of this seat in Parliament, I am deeply honoured to have the enormous responsibility of representing some 140,000 residents as part of a centuries-old tradition of protecting citizens by checking the otherwise unlimited power of the Crown. Parliaments exist in order to ensure that the Crown and its agent, the government, cannot impose itself on citizens without their consent. That consent is granted through votes in this incredible institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017827">Once again, I thank the voters of Calgary Rocky Ridge for electing me to be their servant in the House. I also wish to thank the 270-odd volunteers who assisted my election campaign. I thank them for their support, for their commitment to their community and for their love of their country. I could not have done it without them. I would like to thank the other candidates who contested the election in Calgary Rocky Ridge for giving the voters choice, without which there is no democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017828">Finally, I wish to thank my family. My three daughters, it seems I began the last Parliament with three young girls who are now three young women. My loving wife, Kimberley, I thank for her love, her understanding, her patience, her unwavering support and for always keeping it real in the Kelly house. To my parents, Marnie and Duane Kelly, I thank them for their constant love and encouragement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017829">Today we are debating last Thursday's Speech from the Throne. My response to the Speech from the Throne is coloured by the recent experience of having knocked on a little under 30,000 doors with my re-election team. What I heard on the doorsteps is what informs my remarks and my impressions of the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017830">To be blunt, the government has virtually no support in my riding. That is simply a fact and it is supported by the election results. I knocked on doors in the communities of Calgary Rocky Ridge in every provincial and federal election over the last 30 years as an activist and in 2015 and 2019 as a candidate, and I have never experienced anything quite like it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017831">It was never easier. People have never been more forthright in coming forward and identifying themselves as Conservative supporters. However, at the same time, I have never had more difficult conversations on doorsteps than I did in this election with people who suggested that they intended to support me, my party and my leader. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017832">For most candidates in most elections, conversations with our own supporters are the easy ones, but not in 2019 in Calgary Rocky Ridge. Some of the conversations I had with supporters were downright heartbreaking. I spoke with people who had not worked in years. I heard from people who told me that they were on the verge of losing their homes. I talked with people whose spouses were working in Texas and coming home for a couple of weekends a month or were working in the Middle East or other parts of the world and only coming home a few times over the course of a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017833">I talked with a man who has lived in his neighbourhood for 20 years and he said that since 2015, seven previously stable families on his block had come apart in divorce. Economic stress and anxiety from unemployment and failing businesses have taken their toll on families, tearing apart the very fabric of our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017834">I spoke with people who openly and candidly expressed their despair, anger and incredulity over what they see as a failure of their country to respect their province. For decades, Alberta has welcomed Canadians from across Canada and indeed people from around the world to be a part of Alberta's economic opportunities. It has transferred much of that wealth back to other provinces and continues to do so despite a recession that has been going on for five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017835">My constituents are demanding action. They cannot wait. They made it abundantly clear to me that regardless of which party was to form a government after the election, they would expect me to speak clearly and without ambiguity about just how devastating these past four years have been. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017836">They expect me to be candid about just how upset they are with their federal government. They told me that they wanted the no-more-pipelines bill reversed. They told me they were stunned that a tanker ban on Alberta exports was brought in while tankers continued to bring in oil to eastern refineries from Saudi Arabia. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6017837">They told me that they could not understand why a government was running such large deficits at a time of economic expansion. They told me that they were appalled by the constant parade of ministers to the Ethics Commissioner, by a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prepared to bully his own cabinet and break the law just to get his own way, and by the way the Prime Minister's personal conduct never matches his moral preening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017838">They told me, at door after door, that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a constant source of embarrassment on the world stage, and that they do not believe that he is up to the diplomatic challenges of our times, because they believe that he is fundamentally an unserious person. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017839">With the campaign behind us, with the country's divisions laid bare in a minority Parliament, last week the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had an opportunity to acknowledge the failings of the last Parliament, which cost him seats and votes in every region of the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017840">He had an opportunity to chart a new course to address the concerns of Canadians who rejected his government's track record. Instead, he delivered a speech full of the same flowery language and grand aspirations that we heard throughout the last Parliament with only a few inadequate words for my constituents in a partial sentence, kind of as an afterthought, where he claimed that the government would “also work just as hard to get Canadian resources to new markets and offer unwavering support to the hard-working men and women in Canada's natural resources sectors, many of whom have faced tough times recently”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017841">Really? “Unwavering support” and “have faced tough times recently”, is that it? Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of energy workers have lost their jobs. Over 100,000 of them are out of work in Alberta right now. There is $100 billion in energy investment that has left Canada since the Liberal government took office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017842">Encana, which was once Canada's largest company, and TransCanada PipeLines are changing their names to remove “Canada” from their business names and relocating to the United States because that is where the work is. However, all the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had to say in his Speech from the Throne was “unwavering support” and “tough times recently”? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017843">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been unwavering in his stated desire to phase out the natural resources sector, and he is succeeding. One incredibly insulting sentence that contained a flagrant untruth was all the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had to say about this in his entire speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017844">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> meant what he said about getting Canadian resources to market, it would require him to undo much of the work of the last Parliament. It would require him to repeal Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> or implement every single one of the Senate amendments that were rejected last spring. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017845">It would require him to repeal Bill <Document DbId="8945674" Type="3">C-48</Document>. It would require him to champion Canada as a reliable source of ethically extracted resources and to disown his own prior anti-Canadian-energy rhetoric. It would require him to actually take concrete steps to ensure Trans Mountain could be completed. It would require him to apologize for chasing its private sector proponent out of Canada and for having to send $4.5 billion to Texas so they could compete with us by building pipelines elsewhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017846">The Liberals think they deserve some kind of credit for buying a pipeline that should never have been for sale in the first place. I can assure them that not one single person I met in my riding, where pipelines are a huge issue, thought that buying it was anything other than a last-ditch solution to a problem 100% of the Liberals' own making. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017847">To sum up, the throne speech contains nothing for my constituents. I received a strong mandate from the people of Calgary Rocky Ridge, and I expect them to hold me to a high standard. My constituents expect nothing less.</ParaText>

It supplies jobs to Canadians all across the country. Thousands of workers in Quebec used to work in Alberta.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6017861">Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I have risen in this 43rd Parliament, so I would like to take a short moment to thank the voters of North Okanagan—Shuswap for placing me in their seat in the House to serve as their representative. I am scheduled to have an opportunity to speak later today and will wait until then to expand on how grateful I am for the opportunity to be here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017862">At this time, I am rising to speak to the Speech from the Throne, so I will use this valuable time to do so. We are expected to use this time to respond to the Speech from the Throne and express our position with respect to the mandate given to us by the voters in our ridings and in relation to the portfolios to which we have been assigned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017863"> I honour that opportunity and intend to capture what I heard on the doorsteps of constituents of North Okanagan—Shuswap, at 15 all-candidates forums and at countless meetings across the riding over the past four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017864">I also plan to address issues relating to the ministry of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, for which I am honoured to be shadow minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017865">One of the key issues I heard regarding North Okanagan—Shuswap was about affordability, that life had become less affordable under the previous Liberal government. I heard continuously that people were concerned about the debt load that was being passed on to future generations, children and grandchildren, who would be forced to pay for the short-sightedness of a tax-and-spend government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017866">Unfortunately, little has changed. The suggestion to cut taxes for the middle class, a class that has never been defined, with no plan to equivalently reduce government spending is once again a reckless one. It is even more reckless when there is no real mention in the speech of how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> plans to rebuild the confidence in Canada's business sector for Canadian and foreign investors, whose confidence is needed to build our economy, an area that should be foremost if we are truly concerned about keeping life affordable for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017867">Business owners in the North Okanagan—Shuswap have told me they are not willing to invest in expansion or capital projects under the current government's direction, sectors like the forest industry. In March of 2016, we were told that within 100 days there would be a framework for a softwood lumber agreement. Three and a half years later, there is still no deal and no mention of forestry in the throne speech. Sectors like agriculture have suffered from strained international relationships and lacklustre trade negotiations. Agriculture is another economic driver that is not mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017868"> If the government is truly responsive to the message the electors gave at the polls, it should recognize these sectors. They are an important and large component of life in the regions of the country where the Liberals lost seats. They should recognize that actions are needed, more than words of platitude, to bring a sense of Canadian unity back to those regions, regions that have been a source of relative wealth for all of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017869">I also want to take part of my time today to address issues related to fisheries, which is my portfolio in the official opposition shadow cabinet. Fishermen and indigenous and non-indigenous groups across the country have grave concerns about Canada's fish stocks, their livelihood and the future of their communities. The fishers, processors and communities that rely on stability of access and markets to make investments in their boats, plants and infrastructure are all looking for certainty. Unfortunately, what we are seeing are more signs of uncertainty, signals of closures of access to the fishing grounds, conflict over who has access and when access may be granted and whether they will be consulted before decisions are made that will affect their work, their business, their communities and their future.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6017870">Canada already has some of the strongest protection measures for its waterways and marine areas through fishing and operational regulation and legislation. These factors must be taken into account when negotiating with global forces set upon locking up Canada as the world's park. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017871">The commitment to protect 25% of our oceans by 2025 cannot be done without abandoning meaningful consultation processes with affected communities and current operators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017872">I often refer to the difference I see between conservation and preservation, with conservation being the wise and conservative use of resources so there is a benefit or revenue attained from that use, allowing for a portion of those benefits to be turned back into the health and growth of that resource, whether it be forestry, land use, fish and wildlife or other natural resources. On the other hand, to me preservation means locking up those resources so there is no benefit or revenue coming back in to use or divide up and put back into maintaining that resource, requiring funding from other resources to be tapped into so it can be used to support that resource that is now locked up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017873">I will always defend the value of conservation over preservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017874">There must also be action on the ground and in the streams if Canada is to rebuild its salmon stocks to the abundance that is possible. We have seen little in the past four years that made a difference in any place other than meeting rooms. Limited resources have actually hit the ground, and now we have seen nothing in the throne speech to even recognize Canada's fisheries and the people who rely on them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017875">It is a pleasant dream to live in a world where nothing is taken and nothing is used, but it is not sustainable in a world where everyone wants more than we had yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017876">In speaking today, I respect the viewpoint that criticism should not be given directly without offering an alternative or solution, so I offer that instead of implementing legislation and policies that will only make life more difficult and expensive for Canadians and make them more dependent on government, let us look for ways to promote our Canadian ingenuity and technology in Canada and abroad to tackle things like climate change and ocean pollution in areas of the world where it is the worst. Let us consult with resource users and developers on how we can do things better and continue to grow and prosper. Let us work with our remote and coastal communities, listen to them and their willingness to protect our lands and oceans, while still deriving a living from the resources available to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017877">In the spirit of working together and co-operation, I offer these alternatives to the way things have been laid out. While holding the government to account during the coming term, I also offer to work together toward solutions that are best for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017884">While the old parties are stuck in a revolving door—sometimes in government, sometimes in opposition—there is one thing that remains constant when it comes to the climate emergency: both parties are all talk and no action. The day after the Marrakech climate change conference, COP22, the Parliamentary Budget Officer told the Liberal government that Canada would need to change course dramatically in order to meet the targets set by the previous Harper government for the environment. What did the Liberals do? They purchased an old pipeline that nobody wanted and invested $19 billion in the oil industry. Still, that was not enough for the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017885">Since the Conservatives claim they have a plan for the environment, could my colleague tell us how they would drastically change course to address the climate emergency?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017888">I have tabled my private member's legislation that would allow each province to allow single-event sports betting. Currently in Canada about $10 billion goes to organized crime or to offshore betting. That money could be redirected to priorities and accountable sports betting could take place. The United States is moving toward this, and the rest of the world has.</ParaText>

We need to deal with criminals who are preying on the most vulnerable here in Canada.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6017891">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be back in this chamber and I want to start by thanking my constituents in Parkdale—High Park for returning me for the second time to this chamber. It is an honour and a privilege to serve them, one I do not take lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017892">I also thank the most important people in my life in terms of getting me to where I am today, the people who gave me guidance as a young child and then as a young man: my parents, Lou and Sul Virani. My dad just celebrated his 78th birthday this past Saturday. I thank my sister Shakufe. My immediate family has been a rock of support through all of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017893">I will confess that it has been a little more troubling and difficult for my youngest son this go-round. In 2015, he was one year old and did not have much conscious memory of what transpired then. This go-round, he was five and missed his dad a great deal during the election, as did my eight-year-old son. However, it is for them that I do this work and for children around the country that we all do this work. It is important to keep them in mind. I love Zakir and Nitin very much. I am not wearing a shirt with cufflinks today, but I have the cufflinks with their initials on them in my pocket, as I always do on important occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017894">The most important person is obviously my significant other, my wife Suchita, who has been a rock of support. We do not come from a political family, but she has, nevertheless, been steadfast and by my side constantly throughout this entire endeavour, even to the point of pulling the vote on election day this past year, which was a first for her. I thank my wife Suchita. I love her dearly. I thank her for allowing me to do what I do, serving this country and my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017895">We have just had the Speech from the Throne, which contains a series of initiatives the government is pursuing. I want to highlight six of them. Members will recollect from the previous Parliament that I remain a litigator who likes to stay organized in his prepared comments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017896">My first point is climate action. We know that climate action is urgent. The country heard about it during the course of the campaign and prior to it. We know we need to take bold action, and we have taken the steps toward that bold action. However, I am going to highlight one important thing because it dovetails with the message sent to us by constituents right around the country: what they are looking for in returning a minority Parliament is more co-operation, and there is no monopoly on a good idea. We need to take best practices from across the aisle, across the country and around the world and implement them as best practices here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017897">I will point to one. We have taken some very bold action with our carbon price in our plan to phase out coal and our initiatives in the just transition. One thing we need to do was not contained in our platform but the platform of a party opposite, the NDP. It talked about a climate accountability mechanism that government would report to. That is exactly the kind of mechanism that is worth studying. I was at COP24 last year in Katowice, and that is the model that is used in Britain that was championed at COP24. I brought that idea back to Parliament and immediately started talking about it. I am glad to see it in the platforms of other parties. It is the kind of idea that we need to take up, because there is nothing more pressing than addressing climate change as an initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017898">My second point from the throne speech is that affordability rang true throughout the country. This is not only germane to my riding, or the city of Toronto or urban centres; this rings true regardless of where one is, from region to region, rural to urban. I would point to a very important commitment in the throne speech that was reiterated when the throne speech was read, which is that the very first act we will be taking as a government is to reduce the taxation burden on low- and middle-income Canadians. How are we doing that? We are increasing the basic personal exemption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017899">Again, it is not a partisan issue, but I will point out a subtle difference that lays bare the difference between the two major parties in this chamber. Conservatives presented the same idea and would have had it universally applicable. Liberals said it is a great idea, but we are going to make it applicable to everyone, except for the top 1%. Why? It is because we fundamentally believe in targeting our measures toward those who need it the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017900">We were criticized in the past, perhaps fairly, for having a middle-class tax cut that applied to people earning between $42,000 and $85,000 roughly, if I remember correctly from the last Parliament. People said, rightfully, that low-income people need taxation relief as much as anyone else. We are delivering that in this campaign platform and with this first initiative. That subtle difference, by ensuring that the benefit goes to those who need it the most and not those who do not need it, is what definitely identifies us as a centrist Liberal Party attempting to address the needs of the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017901">The third point I want to touch on is housing. Housing is critical. The issue I heard time and time again when I knocked on doors during the last campaign was housing. Whether it was support for housing, affordable rental housing or the ability for people to buy their first homes, people are feeling the pinch. They are feeling squeezed out of the housing market. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6017902">It is incumbent upon all of us to address that pinch clearly and vigorously. We are doing just that with a $55-billion plan that is 12 years deep to address housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017903">The campaign is over. It is time to implement those policies, starting with the Canada housing benefit, which will be a portable benefit so that a person is not attached to a particular apartment or unit. People take that benefit with them wherever they move in a riding, in a city or around the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017904">The fourth important theme is critical. It is gun control. I want to talk about this a little bit, because when we speak about gun control, we are speaking about the needs of all Canadians. This need not be a rural/urban issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017905">I was so excited to get going on the throne speech that I neglected to mention that I would be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252645" Type="2">Vaughan—Woodbridge</Affiliation>. I congratulate him on his return to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017906">With respect to gun control, this past Friday was a noted anniversary. It was the 30th anniversary of the Montreal massacre.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6017907">I remember that time 30 years ago very clearly, because my sister was a young student at McGill University. Since she was in Montreal at the time, many people called to make sure Shakufe was okay, that she was safe. We knew she was okay, because she had let us know. We were lucky; our family was lucky.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6017908">There are 14 families who were changed forever that evening. What troubles me is that sometimes people think that while Jacinda Ardern has done really well on gun control, hot on the heels of a brutal massacre in New Zealand, we do not need to wait for another massacre to act. We have had our share of troubles. We continue to have our share of troubles, such as 30 years ago in Montreal and on January 29, 2017, in Quebec City.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017909"> We have had incidents of people being slaughtered through guns that are used only for the purposes of mass killing. Those are not hunting rifles; those are not legitimately pursued weapons; those are weapons that have no place in Canadian society. We made a bold commitment to get rid of military-style assault weapons. That was reiterated in the throne speech and I am determined to ensure that we see that through its course, and see it through quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017910">However, it does not just stop there. As a Toronto member of Parliament, I believe firmly in the need for gun control. Yes, there are many facets that contribute to the gun problem and to violence in cities like mine. There are gang problems and there are border control problems, but part of the problem is also the availability of readily accessible handguns that serve no place in a city like Toronto, or in many of our urban centres and centres otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017911">This issue impacts our communities, including our racialized communities. It affects mental health and those who pass on by suicide. It dovetails with domestic violence, particularly violence perpetrated against women. We will address all of those issues by addressing the nub of the issue, which is gun control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017912">The fifth theme that I want to touch on is indigenous reconciliation. I was very proud to see that reiterated again in the speech, as it needs to be. This will take seven generations to resolve. We made gigantic progress in the last Parliament, in terms of addressing monetary needs, boil water advisories, child welfare legislation and the Indigenous Languages Act, which I was very privileged to work on as the parliamentary secretary to the then minister of heritage. What I learned on that file is that, notwithstanding my own background on equity issues and on fighting discrimination, we will get nowhere in this country in rectifying all sorts of other issues that deal with inequality unless we address the core and foundational issue, which is 400 years of colonialism and racism fomented against indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017913">The sixth theme I wanted to talk about is pharmacare. In an effort to reach across the aisle, we have heard about this from many different parties in this House. The time is now to address the lacuna in our current situation of policy. In the entire OECD, we stand alone as the only country that supports medical care and not medicine with publicly financed support. That is a minority of one that I personally do not want to be in and I know the colleagues opposite share that view.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017914">Exploring dental care is another fine suggestion that was brought forward in the NDP campaign platform. It was mentioned in the throne speech and I believe it is worth exploring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017915">Mr. Speaker, you know that I came to this chamber as a human rights and constitutional lawyer. You know, because we served together, that I came here as a refugee from Uganda and that I have taken advantage of the opportunities that were provided to me in this fine country and I have worked to make it better. We have made great strides over the last four years, but there is so much more work to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017916">I just want to finish on this note and say four things that I thought about after getting re-elected, which I would commit to myself, my constituents and this chamber. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017917">The first is to continue to speak out about what I have always believed in: fighting discrimination, promoting equality and making Canada more inclusive for all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017918">The second is to continue to champion human rights, both here and abroad, at every opportunity that presents itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017919">The third is to ensure that housing is not a fanciful ideal, but is something that manifests for people in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017920">Finally, the fourth is to ensure that we will always work harder, faster and more ambitiously on climate change because climate change is the most pressing issue of our time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017921">In a spirit of co-operation and collegiality, I offer congratulations to all the new members and returning members to this House. I hope to work with all members collaboratively to better this nation and this Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017923">My question is straightforward. In his remarks today, the member mentioned targeting measures for those who need it the most.

              <ParaText id="6017925">In terms of the member's question, it is a delicate one. We provided a universal incentive for people to purchase zero-emission vehicles, but the member should note that we have targeted it to lower-priced zero-emission vehicles, so $50,000 or less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017926">There are Tesla vehicles and other types of vehicles out there that are in the $80,000 and $90,000 range. We specifically excluded them because those vehicles are in the reach of a certain part of the population but are not in the reach of low-income and middle-income individuals. It is low-income and middle-income individuals we are targeting, which is why the ZEV tax credit was targeted at that price threshold and not beyond it.</ParaText>

On dental care, we talked about a specific, practical, doable program that could be implemented immediately and the throne speech merely talked about a universal program being studied. To me, that seems to be a cynical approach to these two important issues.</ParaText>

Specifically, and I am not sure if this is germane only to Ontario, but there is a lacuna that exists for people who are on what is called the Ontario disabilities support program. They receive dental coverage but as soon as an individual hits 65 years of age and access to CPPD, all of a sudden, dental coverage stops. That is a problem. That is a problem for people who live to be about 80 or 90 years old. We need to address that. We need to study it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017945">I thank the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge for placing their faith and trust in me for a second term. The citizens in my riding humbled me with a strong vote of confidence in my ability to represent them, tripling the margin of victory and achieving over 50% of the votes cast that evening. It is a wonderful vote of confidence and I wish to thank them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017946">The results speak to a lot of hard work and an unwavering commitment to my constituents that I always will represent them to the best of my capability and will always be their strong voice in Ottawa. Whether it is through visiting residents in their homes and listening to their concerns and issues, or always being available to our wonderful seniors, whom I love dearly, or listening to the opinions of the dynamic, entrepreneurial and very successful business community, which over the last five years has created over 60,000 new full-time jobs in the city of Vaughan, I will ensure their voices are always heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017947">My team of volunteers, those individuals who canvassed, put up signs, sent positive vibes and made the phone calls that count are an inspiration to me. I say a gracious thanks, <I>merci beaucoup</I>, <I>grazie mille</I>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017949">The Speech from the Throne, in my view, is analogous to a blueprint, a blueprint for a more prosperous and inclusive Canada for all Canadians, a blueprint to move the country forward and ensure that we are facing not only the challenges today, but as important, preparing for the ones that may come tomorrow to this beautiful country we call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017950">As MPs we have many duties and fiscal responsibilities to fulfill. I believe the most important responsibility we have as members of Parliament is to advocate for policies to provide Canadians with what I call equality of opportunity. Let me elaborate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017951">It is the utmost responsibility for every single MP to ensure that every Canadian, every citizen, has the opportunity to fulfill their capacity as individuals. That can only be achieved through one thing and one thing only. We ourselves need to demonstrate leadership, but leadership only comes from when we serve. Every single member of Parliament is a servant. As noted by Martin Luther King, Jr., life's most important question is: What are we doing for others?

              <ParaText id="6017953">It is time for all 338 MPs in this wonderful House in the 43rd session of Parliament to be servants, to listen, to act with humility and to ensure that we build a stronger, more inclusive country for all Canadians from coast to coast to coast, one that leaves a healthy environment as well as a prosperous and optimistic future for our children and all the children across this wonderful country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017954">The throne speech laid out a number of themes that our government will focus on together working with all parties. These include fighting climate change, reconciliation, making life more affordable while we continue to strengthen the middle class, all much important work. I would like to focus my remaining time on the last theme, about the middle class and strengthening our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017955">Capitalism in the 20th and 21st centuries created enormous wealth across this world. It lifted billions of people out of poverty across this globe and allowed innovation, an exponential increase in agricultural yields, advances in technology, medicine and social innovation to occur. The world is more connected than we ever knew it and who knows what will happen in the years to come, but it is a very exciting future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017956">We as a government will continue to ensure that our policies are based on the values that we fundamentally believe in and care about in this country and are in place to grow the Canadian economy and create good jobs and an optimistic future for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017957">Continuing from our first mandate, we will encourage competition, encourage risk-taking and investment by entrepreneurs. We will give Canadians the skills to respond and adapt to an ever-changing global marketplace. We will provide for tax fairness to put more money in the pockets of Canadian families with that goal that we as a government continue to strengthen the middle class, create a more optimistic future and remain the envy of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017958">We saw the results over the first four years with over one million jobs created, primarily full time in where I like to see them, the private sector. Over 800,000 Canadians were lifted out of poverty including over 200,000 to 300,000 children. Those are real stories across Canada. We can pick a province or pick a city and we will see there are Canadians who benefited directly from the policies that we put in place in our first session.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6017959">As we did in 2015, our government will again provide tax relief for millions of Canadians. We did it once and we are going to do it again. A promise made will be a promise kept, with a tax cut aimed at those Canadians who need it the most. All Canadians who earn income, whether it is income earned at work, pension income or even investment income, will see a rise in the basic personal exemption amount. This is something that I argued be put in our platform and it is great to see it there. The amount we earn before paying federal taxes will be increased quicker than would happen naturally, from $12,000 to $15,000, while remaining to be indexed. For taxpayers in Canada who earn approximately $15,000, that will mean $300 more in their pockets to spend on the things they deem to be important. Whether they are saving for their kids' future or paying for everyday necessities, it is their money and we are going to give it back to them. This tax cut will provide over $5 billion annually in tax relief to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017960">I am proud to be part of a government that is focused on lowering taxes for middle-class Canadians. I am proud to be part of a government that will provide tax relief to Canadians from coast to coast to coast. The first time, nine million Canadians benefited from our tax reduction of approximately $20 billion over five years. Over the next two to three years, we will see $15 billion to $20 billion of tax relief dedicated to those families who need it the most, not the wealthiest 1%, not those earning over $200,000 or $300,000. Average middle-class families in Canada earning $70,000 or $75,000 will see over $600 more in their pockets. That to me is great news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017961">I am blessed to represent a riding that is defined by dynamic entrepreneurial spirit and a can-do attitude. It is an attitude I see every day in the nearly 12,000 small businesses that are located in the city of Vaughan and the approximately 4,000 that are located in my riding. It is a spirit of asking what they can do for this country rather than the opposite. It is a spirit of hiring and growing our economy, a spirit of getting to work and making things happen. These business owners and entrepreneurs have my utmost respect. Their success is not due to luck but due to hard work and perseverance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017962">Some of the most successful entrepreneurs and private enterprises in this country are in my riding. I know first-hand that we must focus on policies that encourage investment, but also provide for what I call inclusive growth, which is when growth occurs, all Canadians benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017963">That has been the focus of our government from the beginning. It is a focus on returning money to Canadians through our middle-class tax cuts, a focus on the Canada child benefit, where eight or nine out of 10 families in Canada were made better off. In my riding, every month, $5 million arrives tax-free to the families in my riding, helping almost 18,000 children and over 10,000 families. That is real change. That is the change that Canadians elected us on in our first mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017964">In this session, I am glad to see in our platform further adjustments to the Canada child benefit that will help families not just in my riding but, more importantly, from coast to coast to coast. We will continue lifting children out of poverty. We will continue creating those good, full-time jobs in the private sector that we saw in our first four years. In fact, for the last 12 months, starting in November 2018 to today, almost 300,000 new full-time jobs have been created in Canada. We still have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world, depending on how we want to use the measurements. However, if we compare apples to apples, we are among the lowest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017965">I spent over two decades working in global financial markets. I grew up in a small town and worked at a pulp mill, a grain elevator and McDonald's, which was one of my first jobs, I know the value of hard work. Hard work is what defines this country. It is what defines the constituents in my riding. That is why we as a government will continue to listen to the hard-working Canadians from coast to coast to coast. We will continue to put in place policies that grow our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017966">I see some of my colleagues from the opposition parties who reside in the beautiful province of Alberta. We will make sure the TMX pipeline gets built. It is being built. This will bring our resources to new markets and make sure we are capturing that full price and lower that differential between oil prices which has hampered the economy of Alberta for the last several years. We need to make sure we get full price for our products and our resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017967"> I look forward to working with all my colleagues from all parties, in the 43rd Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017968">One of my hallmarks of the 42nd Parliament was to reach out to individuals from other parties, to say hi, to become friends with them and get to know them. If many of us in this House do that, we will see a much more congenial place and a nicer attitude. I see some smiles across the aisle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017969">Mr. Speaker, through you, I would like to say good morning and <I>bonjour à tous</I>. I would also like to say a special good morning to my kids, and tell them to stay strong, that daddy loves them and he will see them soon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017970"> With that, I look forward to questions and comments.</ParaText>

I am concerned though that the rosy picture he has painted of the situation in our country does not reflect what we are hearing. We know that 71,000 jobs were lost this month. We know that $80 billion of investment has left Canada and that foreign investment has been reduced 50%. We know that the economy is supposed to be flat and not growing over the next one to two-year term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017972">If we really are to help the middle class, we need to admit where we are at and that this is the result of disastrous policies in the Liberal government.

We have seen net full-time employment rise in the country by over 1.1 million, if not more, in the last five years. We have seen our government take action with the accelerated investment incentive put in place in the prior budget to encourage manufacturers to invest, which is what they are doing. We have seen a resilient economy, and that is backed by resilient Canadians investing in our country. </ParaText>

In my comments on the throne speech, I said that I fundamentally believed in equality of opportunity for all Canadians to succeed. We need to ensure that Canadians living in rural Canada, in the beautiful parts of our country, are connected to the Internet. The Internet is very equivalent to the telephone of 20 or 30 years ago. Every person in Canada needs to be connected to the Internet to undertake the actions he or she needs to succeed. We need to ensure that. In the prior session, the government invested hundreds of millions of dollars into this and formed partnerships with telecom companies across Canada. We need to ensure that rural Canada is as connected as urban Canada. There cannot be two standards; there has to be just one.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6017986">This tax cut would actually take 700,000 people from our tax rolls. That would be 700,000 people across Canada not paying anymore federal tax.

              <ParaText id="6017991">I am very sad for my family today. My mother is from Quebec and my father is from Saskatchewan. It is not uncommon for Canadian families to have one parent from the west and the other from the east. We heard a similar story on the other side of the House last week. Families becoming divided has become a Canadian story, and that is very sad. We are divided because the other side of the House spent the past four years playing all kinds of political games. The government split us right in half. It pit regions against one another. That is truly sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6017992">My region, the west, and more specifically Alberta, where the energy sector has no support, obviously comes to mind.

There is Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which makes it practically impossible to build a pipeline and transport oil. That is very sad. The carbon tax is another example. Bills that impede the energy sector have serious consequences on families and individuals. Bills like these are completely destroying families and people's lives.

The world needs these resources. Our own nation needs these resources. There is no need for us to bring these resources in from other nations that do not honour the rule of law and do not honour democracy. We have all of these resources within our backyard still. We need them and we need to use them. </ParaText>

However, we must evaluate the reality as it stands right now, which is that we have resources and the world needs these resources. The government has not allowed us to use these resources for our benefit, the world's benefit or Canada's benefit, but with that we would definitely see a continuation in the quality of life for all Canadians as we have for many years as a result of these resources.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018020">Mr. Speaker, it is an absolute delight to present my first speech in the 43rd Parliament. To begin, I have to thank the people of Elgin—Middlesex—London for re-electing me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018021">Just to take a moment, I would like to thank my incredible campaign team. They were out there knocking on doors, putting up signs and having a great time spreading the word of what we can do here. I know I got back here because I have the most incredible office staff. They know about my constituents, they know what their needs are and they are always there to serve them, so a special thanks to Cathy, Jena, Scott, Jill and Charli. </ParaText>

We know this job, especially for any of the newer parliamentarians, is not a job. It is a life. When members take this role on, it is not just a career choice. We live and breathe being a member of Parliament trying to always work for our constituents, and making sure what we are doing is in the best interests of our community and the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018023">Following the election, I lost two dear friends. One was my former campaign manager, Brian Clements. May Brian rest in peace.

The second was Dave Dillon, our regional coordinator, who I worked with as part of the Conservative Party for over the last 16 years. I thank Dave for always having that smile and crazy giggle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018024">It is because of people like them that I am here today and have the courage and strength to talk about what the throne speech mentioned and listen to the debate on how Canada needs to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018025">It is very simple: We have returned to a minority government. Within Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces we saw huge changes. However, we also saw the wiping out of the Liberal Party in the west. When we talk about Saskatchewan and Alberta, we are all Canadians, so it does not matter where my friends are living. It is my job to worry about them as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018026">One thing I have to say is that, throughout this debate, I see division is so strong. It is very hard to listen to my colleagues from the Calgary area talk about job losses and suicides and the fact that no one is taking those issues seriously because they need to diversify. Yes, that is fine, but let us please have compassion for those people in the west being impacted by some of these laws and regulations being made by the government. It is great to say that, but we are not losing friends and neighbours like people from Alberta and Saskatchewan are. I ask for a bit of compassion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018027">For the last number of weeks, I have been fortunate to work on many files. One of the big files I worked on was the CN Rail strike. The reason I am mentioning this is that one of the big things that the Liberals have said is that they are going to work with people. I wanted to bring up the CN Rail strike because it impacted Ontario a great deal, especially southwestern Ontario. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018028">I received a call from Dowler-Karn CFO Dan Kelly, who is also the chair of the board for the Canadian Propane Association. He let me know that they were going to stop delivering all propane to any farmers who were going to be drying their crops. Last year in Ontario, we had bad mould on our crops and this year we have grain that cannot be dried. Whether it is soybeans, wheat or corn, they cannot be dried. With that, farmers are going to have a lot of damage and financial loss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018029">I received the call on a Thursday night, and by Friday morning we were working with our team and the member for <Affiliation DbId="252635" Type="2">Chatham-Kent—Leamington</Affiliation>. We sat down with about 50 farmers and stakeholders and pushed this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018030">The next thing I did was reach out to my Liberal counterparts, and I would like to say a very special thanks to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252826" Type="2">London West</Affiliation>, who actually picked up the phone and told me that the Liberal government was going to pick up the phone, call people and find out from stakeholders what was going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018031">She did not know until she had that conversation with propane stakeholders what the impact was to our farmers and what the impact was to people who did not have natural gas flowing down their pipelines because they live in rural parts of Ontario. She was willing to take that phone call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018032">She was one member of Parliament from the Liberals who took my call. No other members returned my call and others sent messages saying they were not getting involved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018033">If we are going to work together, my stakeholders are everyone's stakeholders. That is why I am telling people that when I want to do something, I am going to make that phone call and I want my stakeholders to be heard. If I am wrong on something, please have the Liberal stakeholders contact me too. I want to know the whole picture. Instead of slamming the door and saying this issue is not important, please remember it is important. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018034">The reason I bring this up goes back to what I am hearing from Calgary. It went viral on Facebook, and we saw a lot of comments on this. People from Alberta and out west were saying, “We do not care about Quebec. Who cares if they get propane?” People from Quebec were saying a different thing, recognizing that propane is heating their homes. We heard about nursing homes that were one day away from not having propane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018035">The reason I bring this forward is because I did not hear a single word from the government. We knew that our grain producers were going to lose money, and we knew that people were having problems with home heating but that the government would not stand up for them. If not for Conservatives, we do not know what would have happened when it came to some of the grain farmers because their voices were not heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018036">One of the other things I hear a lot about is climate change, and of course that is going to be a theme throughout the current government. I do not think there is a person in this room who does not talk about climate change with his or her constituents. For me, it is one of those things that, as we are moving forward and talking about it, we all have different ways of looking at climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018037">I was talking about the carbon tax in Elgin—Middlesex—London. If people are talking about the carbon tax in downtown Toronto, they are not going to talk about what my farmers are talking about in Elgin—Middlesex—London. They are not going to talk about the carbon tax that was put on their propane bills or put on their energy bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018038">People had a $400 carbon tax when they were trying to dry their tobacco. How are they going to go forward if they have a new $400 tax that is already put on that? Those are the things we are seeing all the time, and they are extremely concerning to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018039">People in cities do not understand the impact. I should not say that, but people who are in downtown ridings may not understand as well as those people who receive the bills what a carbon tax looks like when trying to dry grain, when loading up kids and going to a grocery store that is 20 minutes away, when people are buying grocery items and know a carbon tax has been applied to them because the cost of transportation has been increased. All of these things impact us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018040">A carbon tax is the decision that the Liberals have gone with, though there are many other ways we can look at this and other technologies that we need to address. I am asking the current government to please be listening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018041">I ask the Liberals to listen to our farmers, listen to our agricultural producers and the agricultural businesses that are wrapped around that. I ask that they make sure they understand, when the farmers are drying corn, how much it actually costs and what the carbon tax adds to that. There are lots of things that farmers are doing throughout this country to make farming work. We know that when the cost of inputs becomes higher, at the end of the day farmers are not going to be able to succeed. I ask the government to work very closely on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018042">Yesterday, I was fortunate enough to be in Aylmer at an event with about 700 people from the Bradley Street Church of God, and I can say that when we speak to Canadians there is a lot that we agree on. In this church assembly there were 700 people, families who were gathering for the Christmas season. Their issues were the top three for many of us here. It is about seniors. It is about veterans. It is about our drug epidemic. Those are some of the social issues that we need to address as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018043"> We know our seniors are having a tough time. We know that with interest rates not being as high as they used to be, seniors are relying on their old age security and on their Canada pension plan and some of the savings they have are drying up. We have to be cognizant of that. We have to ensure housing and make sure seniors have a good way of life. We need to be there as a government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018044">For our veterans, I applaud the government on the fact that we are looking at veterans' homelessness. That is something that we all need to do. We need to do that together, so I appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018045">Also, I am asking about the drug epidemic. We have had over 10,000 people die in this country and we could be doing better. It is not just the fentanyl that we are talking about. It is the crystal meth and it is all of those drugs. We need to work with all levels of government. Therefore, I ask the government to learn how to work with all levels of government, learn how to work with the Conservative Party, learn how to work with the provincial Premier of Ontario, unlike what it has done over the last months, and to please work with our municipalities. If the Liberals really want to get something done, I ask them to please work with us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018062">Mr. Speaker, to be honest, if I have a right answer, it is not yes or no. However, we do need to look at this, because we have to understand that many people's RRIFs are drying up when they get to the age of 75 and still have time to live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018063">The government is supposed to be a backstop for many of these programs, like the guaranteed income supplement, but we have many seniors in need. We need to do an overall review of this. Because of the rise in taxes, because of the carbon tax, because of all these things that seniors did not have at one time, what they used to have is not enough. I believe we need to do a full study on that.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="214668" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6018064">Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise and address those in this beautiful chamber. I would first like to thank the constituents of Winnipeg North for once again affording me the opportunity to be here representing what I believe is the best and most diverse riding in our country. I suspect there might be 337 other people who might challenge that thought, but it is an absolute privilege to be representing the residents of Winnipeg North.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018065">That said, I want to reflect on a number of the issues I heard from constituents. Another member gave his perspective earlier on what people were saying. We often hear about the middle class. When I sat in opposition in the Stephen Harper era, it was very rare to hear about Canada's middle class. If one were to perform a word search, one would find that to be the case. We would hear it periodically, but this would come from the Liberal Party, the third party at the time, and particularly its leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018066">Nothing has really changed with respect to this government's priority. Whether as the third party or as we are now, having received a second mandate, we talk about the importance of Canada's middle class. We understand and appreciate how important the middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it are to our society, economy and the social fabric that we call Canada today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018067">In terms of some of the actions that have already taken place, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> today talked about another tax break coming to Canada's middle class. One of the very first actions we took after the 2015 election was a tax break to Canada's middle class. We have seen consistency from this government with regard to Canada's middle class, which I believe is the reason we have seen, with the help of Canadians in all regions of our country, the generation of a lot of good, positive news. This is highlighted by the fact that over one million jobs were created in the last four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018068">I know there are significant portions of the country that have not done as well as others. If we look at the history of Canada, we find that at different points in time some areas have been more challenged than others and that at times it is necessary for the government to be more involved. We have seen this in the Prairies, specifically with the province of Alberta and the federal government. When one region has been suffering more economically than others, the government has listened very carefully and supported regional interests where it could.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018069">I suggest that members take a look at issues surrounding western diversification funds and their allocation or at the percentage of infrastructure dollars that have been committed or in many ways spent in some of those areas. This federal government has worked more with municipalities than Stephen Harper ever did, because we recognize that in many ways it is the municipalities that deliver so many of those services, particularly in relation to infrastructure services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018070">For Canada's middle class, Liberals have made huge strides in the area of international trade. We have seen a government that has not only had discussions but has also signed off on some very important trade agreements around the world. In fact, this government has signed off on more trade agreements with other countries than any other government. We even did more than Stephen Harper did, because we understand and appreciate the value of those trade agreements.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018071">No matter what the Conservative Party attempts to say about trade, it cannot rewrite history on the facts. What I just stated was factual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018072">There are many things we have done over the last four and a half years that have had a profound and positive impact on all regions of our country. Thinking about the years ahead and reflecting on the mandate, and based on discussions I have had with my constituents, I believe Canadians want us to continue moving forward on the many progressive policies that we have brought in over the last four years and to lobby and advocate for those progressive policies. A vast majority of them would want me to say that. I am committed to doing that, and I believe the government will continue to do that as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018073">I also recognize that Canadians want to see a higher sense of co-operation, a higher sense of responsibility from members on all sides of the House, not just from the government side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018074">The biggest disappointment I had at people's doors was a negative attitude toward politics. Many people did not vote because they were discouraged by the negative attitude that too many politicians have, and we see it virtually every day when the House is sitting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018075">In my previous speeches in the House, I often talked about the character assassination by the official opposition of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> or other selected individuals, whether justified or not. Conservatives put politics before people. It is that sense of negativity, the “Prince of Darkness” negativity or whatever we want to call it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018076">At the end of the day, Canadians want to see a higher standard in the House. I would suggest it could start right on the floor of the House. We do not need to make things as personal as we have witnessed over the last four years. It is not warranted. As my colleague would say, park the politics as much as possible. Personal character assassination does not do well to build a consensus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018077">There are many areas we could agree to support. The previous speaker talked about the importance of our children and that she is going to work with the minister in Alberta regarding them. This government has done a great deal for Canadian children. We have lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty through the Canada child benefit program. This has helped children in every region of our country. Over $9 million a month goes into Winnipeg North alone through the Canada child benefit program. That has an incredible impact on disposable income to support our children. It helps to lift children out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018078">I have good news for members opposite. This government is going to continue to support our children in all regions of Canada. As the Conservative member opposite just alluded to, when we have positive measures, and there are a lot of positive measures, members can support what the government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018079">There has been some criticism of the throne speech. I have been a parliamentarian for 30 years and I have been in opposition for most of those years. I hope to tie it up at the government level at some point. It was 20-plus years in opposition and five or six in government. I am an optimistic person.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018080">I am suggesting that, at the end of the day, throne speeches are very much general documents. We are always going to find things, whether it is in this throne speech, Harper's throne speech or the 10-plus provincial and territorial throne speeches that come out. It is very rare that one will get into the real nitty-gritty specifics. We are always going to find things that we would like to have seen incorporated into a throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018081">However, if we take a look at the important issues that we are highlighting, such as Canada's middle class, the environment and reconciliation, these are all ideas that I believe should generate support from both sides of the House. One does not need to vote against it because it is a government throne speech. There are many things within this throne speech that I suspect everyone will, in fact, support. I would suggest the vast majority of things stated in this throne speech are things members on both sides of the House should get behind and support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018082">I have heard members across the way talk about seniors. We did a great deal in the previous four years. I ask members to remember that one of the very first initiatives we did was to reverse the Conservatives' decision to increase the age of retirement for OAS. When I was first elected a person had to be 65 in order to collect OAS, old age security. The former Stephen Harper government increased the age to 67, but one of the very first things we did was to put it back to 65.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018083">In addition to doing that, we recognize that there is always a limited amount of finances to be put into any given envelope. We wanted to help the poorest of our seniors, so we substantially increased the guaranteed income supplement, which lifted hundreds plus thousands of seniors in all regions of our country out of poverty. In Winnipeg North alone, hundreds of Canada's poorest seniors were actually lifted out of poverty because of that particular initiative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018084">However, it does not stop there. We talk about moving forward with our seniors, and there are a couple of other items, one of which is highlighted quite well in the throne speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018085">My New Democratic friends talk about the guaranteed income supplement increasing at age 75 and ask why not have it increase at age 65. That is a good question. It is a very good question. I raised this issue at the doors of my constituents. If there are <I>x</I> number of dollars to put into supporting seniors and trying to assist seniors in the best way possible, there is a big difference between a senior who is 65 years old and one who is 75 years old. I am going to be 65 pretty soon myself. I am 57, turning 58.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018086">If we have the choice of giving a greater increase to those people who are 75 as opposed to those at the younger age of 65, I suggest that there is a greater benefit to society if we can give a larger percentage increase to those who are 75 and over. As a direct result of targeting it that way, we are going to be able to assist them more. My colleagues will find that there are many 65-year-olds who choose to continue to work. It does not mean that we have to stop there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018087">At the end of the day, one of the good things we did was to bring forward a seniors directorate. This is a government that genuinely and truly cares about the future of our seniors. That is one of the reasons we have been very selective and effective at getting more money into the pockets of the seniors who need it the most. That is what we should be striving to do, and we have been very effective at doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018088">I ask members to stop and think about this. We are giving a bigger increase to those who are 75 and older. We are giving another tax break to Canada's middle class. These are things that reinforce the tax cuts and the increases that we gave to the Canada child benefit and the GIS in the previous Parliament.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018089"> All of those money breaks are going to put money into the pockets of Canadians in every region of this country. By doing that, we are increasing overall disposable income, and by doing that, we are allowing Canada's economy to do that much better. With an increase in disposable income, we see more expenditures in our communities. That is one of the reasons that this government has been so successful. By investing in people, we have had an economy that has done relatively well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018090">I was a bit discouraged when one member tried to point out that because of job losses there have been people committing suicide, and that somehow the government should feel guilty. When hundreds of thousands of people were finding themselves out of work in the manufacturing industry, in particular in Ontario and so forth, the Liberal Party cared. We were compassionate toward that. Equally, we care about and are compassionate toward those who have been losing jobs in our natural resources sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018091">Sadly, when a person loses a job, and it does not matter in what region of the country, it can be a very trying time. To say it is one person's fault or the government's fault is somewhat irresponsible. Let us look at the bottom line and the way the economy and policies have been presented in the last four years. If we listen to what is being said in the throne speech and what is being said by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the many speeches he delivers, and the speeches of ministers and many of my colleagues, we will see that we are on the right course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018092">That is why a major theme for us going into the election was that we want to continue to move forward on what is important to Canadians. We know it is important to Canadians because we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has continually said to members of Parliament, in particular Liberal members of Parliament, that here in Ottawa we represent the constituents first. We do not represent Ottawa to our constituents. It is the constituents and their interests that we represent first, here in Ottawa, and that is why we have the relationships that we have built within our caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018093">We have a great caucus that is committed to the long-term viability and strength of building Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. We have a caucus that understands the importance of the economy and social programs. One of those social programs that has to be highlighted is Canada's pharmacare program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018094">Prior to this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, I very rarely heard the word “pharmacare”. It is only because of this Prime Minister and this government, and through the members of Parliament and their constituents that we have raised that whole issue to where it is today, a point where I feel very confident that we will have a national pharmacare program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018095">I would like to see all members of this chamber, whether they are New Democrat, Bloc, Conservative, Green or independent, get behind a national pharmacare program. This has taken a great deal of time to put together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018096">We have a government that is prepared to work with all the different stakeholders and listen to what they have to say. However, if the need is there to make that decision, we should make that decision for the betterment of all Canadians. This is a government that understands that every day is an opportunity to work hard and provide better results for all Canadians in all regions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018098">He said that the government cares about the middle class and that the evidence is just to do a word search in Hansard to see how many times that word appears. I took him up on the challenge and went to openparliament.ca. There is a feature on there where one can find a member's favourite word, the word a member uses most frequently in the House of Commons. Do members know what the favourite word of the member for <Affiliation DbId="252532" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> is? It is “Conservatives”. When he speaks in the House, the thing he talks about most is not the middle class or pharmacare. It is the Conservatives. That is revealing in many ways about his speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018099">In the last four years, taxes went up for the middle class. The government did everything it could to increase taxes for the middle class.

When one compels a party to do something, it is much better to say “the Conservative Party” than “Hey, you over there on the other side.” Conservatives will find that if they look beyond my favourite word, they will likely find me asking when the Conservatives will do this or that, or why the Conservatives complain about this or that. That is likely why that is my favourite word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018101">I can say that one of the issues I raise more and more is the benefit of the tax cut that the Conservative Party voted against in the last Parliament.

In fact, in the last budget, I gave Quebec credit as a province, because one of the initiatives it had in dealing with the environment was to have a rebate for electric cars. That is an initiative that we have adopted as a national government. Many wonderful, positive policy initiatives originate in the province of Quebec.

              <ParaText id="6018137">The creation of Canada dates back to 1867. We need to understand why and how Canada was created to understand how it works today. Canada was not created by a mass movement or a revolution. It was not created by people taking to the streets and saying that they wanted to come together as one nation. The reason Canada was created is simple. It was a matter of economics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018138">In 1840, our main trading partner was Great Britain, which decided in the early 1840s to start looking to Europe to do trade. In a way, Great Britain abandoned Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018139">Discouraged at not being able to export to what some of us here would consider the motherland, Canada decided to turn to the United States. In 1854, it signed a reciprocity treaty that made it possible for Montrealers and local producers from Canada, which had not yet become Canada, to export to the United States, achieve some economies of scale and make a lot of profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018140">The reciprocity treaty they signed was in place from 1854 to 1864. This treaty would not be renewed because the American Civil War broke out and Great Britain made the regrettable decision to support the South. In retaliation, the Americans told their neighbours to the north that all trade between them was at an end.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018141">Seized with panic, the Fathers of Confederation decided the most important thing was to protect the wealthy and provide a market where they could sell their goods. These people created that market artificially. That is what Canada is today. It was created to make rich people happy back in 1867. That was the Fathers of Confederation's only motivation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018142">The new Canadian federation needed a strong central government. I can already hear the NDP and Liberal Party members clapping. They are descended directly from those founding fathers. To establish a strong government and avoid a civil war like the one to the south, which was a bad experiment if ever there was one, it was decided that all of the powers would be given to the federal government and the provinces would get the crumbs. That is what these people did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018143">With regard to spending, the government held on to marine transportation, customs and borders, and rail transportation. The provinces were left with a pittance: health and education. It was a pittance at the time because the clergy took care of those things. The state was not yet secular. Maybe my colleagues will infer something from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018144">To ensure a strong central government, customs and excise duties were given to the federal government. The provinces were given income tax revenues, which were not very significant at the time. It was almost nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018145">Those are the foundations of Canada, our country, or rather that of my colleagues opposite. How we operate is based on those foundations. The fundamental problem is that the Fathers of Confederation could not have foreseen what was to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018146">In the 1960s, health and education became the primary expenses in Canada. It is what was most important at the time. Today, half of all of Quebec's spending goes to health. The federal government is not there. The same goes for education. What was thought to be negligible at first became extremely significant. The only reason the federal government can intervene is because during Confederation in 1867, the federal government put the Canadian provinces in a position where they had to beg. Their revenues were so weak that they depended on federal transfers. They were under the control of the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018147">In 1954, following successive attacks by the federal government to control provincial income tax, the provinces finally caved. Only one province decided to take back control because it felt it was important for its people to have a financial tool to allow it to achieve its dreams and objectives. Only Maurice Duplessis, in 1954, said he wanted to keep that system. That is another reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018148">What does this mean? The throne speech mentions health, but that is not the government's concern. Health expenditures are the responsibility of the provincial governments and of Quebec. When the government starts saying that it would like to have this and that, it is not their business. What is important is for it to give the provinces and Quebec the money they need to fund their services and serve the people, who keep saying that health is their absolute priority. The government must respond to this appropriately and not in the way it did in the throne speech. That is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018149"> According to the Thomson report tabled in 2014, maintaining health services for Canadians in light of inflation, aging and the increase in the population, as well as progress in health technologies, required a 5.6% annual increase. However, Harper and his gang started capping the increase at 3%. That is scandalous. The provinces are asking the government for an increase of at least 5.6%. That is what it needs to give them to maintain provincial health systems. That is why it is important to increase provincial transfers and to listen to Quebec and the provinces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018167">Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 86th anniversary of the Holodomor, the famine genocide in Ukraine in 1932-1933. Nineteen people per minute, 1,200 per hour and 28,000 per day were dying of famine at the height of the Holodomor. The world was silent and millions died as a result.</ParaText>

Honouring them, she said, meant not just remembering them, but learning the mistakes of the Holodomor and taking steps to make sure a crime like this would never happen again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018169">Unfortunately, recently a University of Alberta lecturer, Dougal MacDonald, did just the opposite. He denied the existence of the Holodomor and he called it a “lie” and a “myth”.

              <ParaText id="6018458"> Mr. Speaker, I was talking about health transfer payments. I explained in detail that the provinces are dependent on funds from Ottawa, and they have been since the beginning of Confederation. Federal government transfers flow to the provinces so that they can do their job. Over time, however, transfers have continued to diminish so that the government can download the deficits to the provinces, as we saw in the nineties, or overload them with standards and conditions to go back to the basic notion that centralizing power was what the Fathers of Confederation intended and that the goal of federal spending is precisely to accomplish that almost-solemn mission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018459">There was no mention of the single income tax return in the Speech from the Throne. On May 15, 2018, the National Assembly unanimously voted in favour of a single income tax return that the Quebec government alone would oversee and administer. I know the motion was passed unanimously because I moved it myself. At the time, the Prime Minister quipped that the National Assembly rarely agrees unanimously on anything, but we saw it happen with the single income tax return. Was that mentioned? No, it was not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018460">There is some hope, however, since our Conservative colleagues believe in the same cause. If the NDP or the Liberals were to help us, we could create a single tax return administered by Quebec, much to the delight of the Quebec National Assembly and Quebeckers. A recent survey shows that 65% of Quebeckers support a single tax return administered by Quebec. The only study that has been done estimates annual savings of $425 million. Not only will this save money, but it will also save time, since Quebeckers will be able to do their taxes faster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018461">The Liberal government and the NDP always use the argument of job losses in the Jonquière and Shawinigan regions, and they say those losses would be drastic. Yes, jobs would be lost. Is that an argument for axing the plan? No. According to the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, 5,300 jobs in Quebec involve administering Quebeckers' income taxes for the federal government. Transferring those responsibilities to the Quebec government would create 2,332 jobs doing the same work for the Quebec government. The Quebec government could easily ensure that those jobs remain in Shawinigan and Jonquière. The other employees could work on tackling tax evasion or managing web giants like GAFA. Those jobs would pay for themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018462">As there is a shortage of workers in the federal public service, those people could easily go work for the federal government. Given that 4% of public servants retire every year and that it will take four years to transfer the federal government's responsibilities to the Quebec government, there will be more than 800 jobs to be filled. Clearly, there will be no job losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018463">Which Liberal or NDP members will join the Quebec consensus that there will be no jobs lost?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018464">Our consensus is that the public service will save $287 million and that Quebeckers who file a single tax return will save time. Who can argue with that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018465">The Bloc Québécois is expecting a positive response. We are ready to have discussions to promote this great idea.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018467">We would have liked the document to make a clear statement on ending the loopholes in supply management. We would like Quebec farmers to no longer be used as a bargaining chip to promote the auto industry in Ontario, or the beef industry in the west. We would like these people to be respected and to never again be directly attacked or have money taken out of their pockets, because they work very hard and deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018468">I would reiterate in closing that I began my speech with a bit of history. Something has changed since the creation of the Canadian Confederation. At the time, Canada's motto was “from sea to sea”. Unfortunately, now it is “drill, baby, drill”.<I /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018469">Sadly, in western Canada, the economy today is concentrated on a single sector. It is not diversified enough. We have to help the west diversify. What people need to realize is that oil dependency is not just an issue for western Canada. It is an issue for the banks as well. Around the world, five of the 12 banks that are currently investing the most in oil are Canadian. The Canadian economy is heavily involved in oil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018470">There is one party here that says we need to produce more oil. It has the advantage of being honest and saying what it really thinks. There is another party that plays around with definitions and contradictions in an attempt to put us to sleep. It says it supports this, but not too much. It does not mention oil, the “elephant in the room”, as my colleague put it earlier, in the throne speech. It talks about climate change, whereas the oil issue goes in the complete opposite direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018471">We need a clear-eyed understanding. If we want to undertake an energy transition, we simply cannot promote oil. Some people are saying that we should change the Constitution, that it is an old model that does not work well and is of no use to us anymore. I explained the problems with that earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018472">I want the House to know that the Bloc Québécois and Quebeckers do not want to play this game anymore. To paraphrase Jean Garon, changing a comma in the Canadian Constitution would be about as easy as scratching my forehead with my front teeth. We quit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018473">What will the Bloc do? The Bloc is here to stand up for farmers, to defend Quebec's territory so that no pipelines are built on it without our permission. The Bloc is here to stand up for our cultural community, which is being attacked by web giants. It will stand up for the Davie shipyard and its extraordinary workers, who have demonstrated the quality of their work time and time again. We will defend the energy transition to ensure that our young people have a healthy future in an extraordinary environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018474">That is the mission of the Bloc Québécois. We will do that work on behalf of Quebec. We will work hard until, one day, Quebec becomes a country.</ParaText>

I would like to remind him that, four and a half years ago, when the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership was finalized, the Conservative government included over $4 billion in the agreement to compensate farmers. We did not wait four and a half years until negotiations were complete. We promised to compensate them, we did it, and we budgeted for it.

We would not be talking about it today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018490">What I am saying is that the best way to prevent money that has been put in from being taken out is simply to stop putting farmers' necks on the line in international trade negotiations, even when acting in good faith.

              <ParaText id="6018530">We have heard clearly from Quebec today that it has no interest, because it already has a program, as do B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In fact, 98% of Canadians already have coverage, and the ones who do not exist in Ontario, Newfoundland and some of the Atlantic provinces. Therefore, it is actually cheaper to put everyone onto the existing provincial plans for $2.2 billion than to spend $15 billion to $40 billion on a program nationally that nobody wants.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6018537">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise and to be back. Congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker, on just moments ago being affirmed as our Deputy Speaker of the House. I look forward to your great and very capable ability to sit in that chair as you demonstrated over the past four years. It is a real honour to be standing again in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018538"> I want to start, this being my first opportunity to do so, by thanking the constituents in my riding of Kingston and the Islands for putting their faith in me to come back here and represent them in this new Parliament. There is nothing quite like the feeling of knowing that one has the support of one's community to represent its residents and to make sure that their voices are heard in Ottawa. It is an incredible honour for me to have that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018539">I also want to take the opportunity to thank the tremendous number of volunteers, just like all of the members in this House. We all have dedicated volunteers in our ridings who make our elections a reality and are able to bring us through the finish line. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018540">There is no doubt that I have that great amount of support in my riding as well. In particular, I want to thank the Queen's University Liberal Association members, who have spent hours and hours donating their time and volunteering. It gives me the sense that the younger generation is keenly interested in politics, and I have a great sense of optimism when I see these young people getting involved in politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018541">I also want to thank my staff in Kingston. I have Ann, Nicole, Kaitlin and Parth, who do amazing work representing me and interacting daily with my constituents. In Ottawa, I have Jeanna, who does great work to keep me on schedule and make sure I am here when it is my turn to speak and whatnot. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018542">Most important, I thank my family, my wife Vanessa and my children Mason, Frankie and Vivian. It is not easy, as most members in this House would know, to leave the riding behind and go for several days at a time without seeing the family. Even with the advancements of technology, it is still not the same as being there in person. I am incredibly grateful for their love and support, as it is required in a job like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018543">I also want to congratulate all of my colleagues, the 337 other members who are in this House for this session of Parliament. We all come from different parts of the country. We have been duly elected by our constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018544">This time around, our constituents throughout the country have decided to bring the Liberal Party back in government but in a minority situation. Canadians have mandated us to work together in a collaborative way so that we can build legislation and present it to Canadians. That truly reflects the form of this Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018545">It is worth pointing out that some pretty incredible legislation has actually come along in minority parliaments from this chamber, for example the creation of the CPP. Even our Canadian flag was created during a minority government. Health care was created during a minority government. There are tremendous examples of how we can work together, and I look forward to working with all members of the House to bring forward meaningful legislation that reflects the will and demands of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018546">I would like to talk about three things in particular that resonated with me in the throne speech, one being the desire to improve the security and strengthen the economic position of so many Canadians. I also want to talk a bit about the government's commitment to health care, and pharmacare in particular. Of course, I also want to address a topic that I have spoken about many times in this House: climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018547">First, when we talk about more security for Canadians and strengthening the middle class, I was extremely proud to be part of a government the last time whose very first opportunity to present legislation in this House was to give a tax cut to the middle class and ask those making significantly more, the one per cent as we might coin them, to pay a bit more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018548">One of the other things we did very early on, probably the second or third piece of legislation that came forward, was the Canada child benefit. Through the data that came out of Statistics Canada a few years later, we saw the impact that had of lifting just under a million, or by this point probably a million, Canadians out of poverty, and in particular almost 300,000 children out of poverty. This is the impact that these policies are having on Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018549">That is why I was extremely pleased to see in this throne speech similar talk. It is important to mention that a throne speech is a guiding document. It is a principled document that sets the overall agenda for a government during the time it will be governing. To see the commitment and the dedication to continuing to build on that was extremely rewarding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018550">In particular, looking forward, raising the basic income exemption to $15,000 so that the Canadians who require it the most will not be burdened with any tax up to that $15,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018551">Also, affordable housing is mentioned in the throne speech. My riding in particular has an extreme shortage of housing right now. Our vacancy rate is at 0.6%. For those who do not know, a healthy vacancy rate is around 3% or 4%. That means that housing costs are being driven up, whether to buy or rent. It is putting people in some very difficult situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018552">Knowing that we will continue to build on our infrastructure, and not just the bricks and mortar but also the social infrastructure that goes into the housing family unit and how we can support them, I am extremely pleased to see. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018553">Regarding increases to the CCB, that signature program that lifted hundreds of thousands of people and children out of poverty, we will now extend it to assist children under the age of one to provide more assistance to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018554">I have two very young children in my family, one just over three years old and another just over one year old. I know the challenges that can be put on families who have a child under the age of one, a newborn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018555">Knowing that people who are already struggling will have the opportunity to tap into more of the resources available to them, and to be taken care of and to be looked after more in that very precious time of the first year, is extremely encouraging. I also know it will give the opportunity to see even more children and families being lifted out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018556">On the second topic of health care, in particular pharmacare, I am very encouraged by two things that were talked about. The first is pharmacare, developing a plan that will address the prescribed medication needs of all Canadians. There are many people in our communities, mine in particular, who have to choose daily between taking their full prescription or paying for rent or food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018557">The reality of the situation is, when they live in a country as rich as Canada with the advancements we have, I do not believe people should be making those decisions between medications and taking care of other necessities in life. It is important for us to bring forward this plan on pharmacare and I look forward to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018558">The other issue is access to a family doctor. I am so glad to see that our government is talking about making sure that every Canadian has access to a doctor. In Kingston, we had a huge shortage of doctors a number of years ago and we set out a plan as a city council to bring more doctors in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018559">The only problem was that we ended up stealing them from neighbouring communities and creating problems for them as we were attracting them to our community. Having a nationalized plan to attract and retain doctors in Canada so that everyone has access to a family doctor is incredibly encouraging to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018560">Finally, when it comes to climate change there is no issue more pressing for future generations than the action that we take with respect to climate change and the action that we take now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018561">As the previous <Affiliation DbId="253366" Type="4">minister of the environment</Affiliation> said, we are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and we will be the last to be able to do anything about it. We need to accomplish some of these extremely ambitious goals of reaching net zero by 2050. We need to reduce our plastic consumption right now by reducing our single-use plastics, and we need to continue to grow that green economy and invest in technologies that will drive us into the future both economically and sustainably from an environmental perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018562">I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House over the next months and years as we make sure that we continue to bring forward legislation in a meaningful and positive way for all Canadians.</ParaText>

As a result, now we have two other problems. One is affordable housing and one is the availability of skilled trades.

              <ParaText id="6018568">When it comes to affordable housing specifically, we have the national housing strategy that is in place right now. There is $40 billion over a 10-year period that, through working with CMHC, housing providers in her riding and all ridings throughout the country can have access to, in order to build affordable housing for people in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018569">The other thing the member spoke of was skilled trades. It is an incredible topic that we really need to focus on. Although I do not have any answers for her right now, it is something that I would love to work with her on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018570">The reality of the situation is that the average mason in Canada right now is 58 years old. We need to do something about increasing the number of people, young people in particular, going into skilled trades because that is where all the money is right now. If any of my kids want to go into skilled trades, I would be the happiest dad in the world because they would be rich. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018583">When we talk about oil and gas, specifically in Alberta, I was really surprised to see recently that Suncor, an oil-producing company, announced that is investing $300 million in Alberta into a wind farm.

I think it is an inspiration to first nations people and others when it comes to living together in harmony. Wendake is a model, an example, an inspiration to Canada and the entire world.</ParaText>

I was with Guy Boutin last weekend, a businessman who works with the Fondation Le Petit Blanchon, an organization that helps children from families that are struggling. Once again, I saw how generous the people of Quebec and Louis-Saint-Laurent are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018593">This is my second time running in a federal election, but it is the fifth mandate I have been given by my fellow citizens. I was elected three times in the riding of Chauveau. In fact, I want to acknowledge the people who gave me the immense privilege of representing them in the Quebec National Assembly exactly 11 years and one day ago, on December 8, 2008. I served in that role for seven years. A few of my former colleagues from the Quebec National Assembly now sit in the House of Commons. It is not that I do not like them, but I thought they were doing a good job in the National Assembly. They should have stayed there. However, the voters decided otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018594">Now let me speak from the heart about my family. A political career is simply not possible without a supportive and understanding family. Let me start with my partner, Pascale. I am going to make the same joke I make every time: that's Pascale with an <I>e</I>. The first time I said that, 11 years ago, everyone burst out laughing. Now, no one bats an eyelash. My partner Pascale has been with me every step of this magnificent adventure. In politics, there are highs and super-highs, but there are no lows. Basically, either things are going well or they are going very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018595">Of course, I also have two children, Béatrice and Jean-Philippe, who are now accomplished adults. They are so dear to me, and I love them so much. They are doing very well for themselves. I am lucky. It is a privilege to have such generous and caring children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018596">Lastly, I would like to talk about my parents, who are 95 and 96 years old and who have been my unwavering supporters for the past 55 years. This year was the first time they were not able to be there when I cast my ballot. It was a tradition. They were not able to attend the swearing-in either. Everyone who was at the swearing-in, including the hard-working volunteers without whom I would not be in this place, could see how much I care for my parents. Even now, in their later golden years, they regularly watch the debates of the House of Commons on television. I must say they sometimes have some pretty harsh things to say about the government, but I am not here to talk about that. </ParaText>

Observers all agree that the Deputy Prime Minister, an MP from Toronto, has been given more authority, taken on more responsibility, to say the least.

We expected more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018610">That is why I have a message for this government, which keeps saying that it is reaching out to the opposition and wants to hear its suggestions. Our country is the global champion of free trade. Canada has 50 agreements with 50 different countries. That is fantastic for Canada's economy. What is incomprehensible is that our provinces cannot do business with one another. That is preposterous.</ParaText>

It should run with our idea to make Canada the global leader of free trade and the country of interprovincial free trade for the good of all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018613">First and foremost, the government of the day has representation in all regions of the country. I am from the Prairies myself and am very proud of that fact. We do share some things in common. The national government does not have any seats in two provincial areas and the Conservatives do not have any seats in two provincial areas: Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018614">On the issue of working with the provinces, this government has achieved a great deal through consultations with them, such as on the Canada pension plan, which will greatly enhance retirement benefits for future workers. It is a positive thing. In working with the provinces and territories, we were also able to achieve the health care accord.</ParaText>

He talks against Doug Ford, Jason Kenney and Premier Moe. He talks against people elected by Canadians. That is not the way to run this country. We have to work together instead of making political arguments against provincially elected people. That is the first point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018620">Second, when we talk about national unity, the first thing to keep in mind is respect for the Constitution. The federal government's role is not to enter provincial jurisdiction on issues like pharmacare. We have pharmacare in Quebec, and decisions on it belong to the province, not at the federal level.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018623">Trois-Rivières is home to many seniors who count on federal programs in order to have a decent quality of life so they can meet their basic needs. Will the provisions outlined in the throne speech really meet their needs? What is being offered to people between the ages of 65 and 75?</ParaText>

As everyone knows, he worked very hard and we all hold him in high esteem. The people have spoken and they elected the member for Trois-Rivières. I recognize and welcome her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018625">We all care about seniors for two reason. First, this issue falls 100% under federal jurisdiction. That is why I was saying earlier that it is important for Canadian unity that the government respect jurisdictions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018626">Second, seniors are the most vulnerable members of our society. When people get to a certain age, they can no longer go back to school to learn a new occupation. They can no longer work 45 hours a week. When people reach a certain age, they want to focus on other things and, most of all, they want to enjoy what previous generations have built for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018627">We therefore echo what the member said about being very attentive to the needs of seniors in Canada, Quebec, the riding of Louis-Saint-Laurent and, of course, the riding of Trois-Rivières.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018629">As members of Parliament it is our duty to be the voice of every Canadian, make his or her life easier and build a future for our country that is prosperous and filled with opportunity. The Speech from the Throne just does not do this. With no plan or even mention of a balanced budget, we are passing our bill to the next generation to pay. This is unfair and frankly reckless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018630">Right now, Canada is starting to see an economic storm coming our way. Instead of making plans to weather the storm, the government seems intent on reckless spending that leaves our cupboards bare and puts Canada's economic future into question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018631">In the run-up to the 2015 federal election, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a big promise. It was not a small one. It was not something that was buried in his campaign platform. He said, “We will balance that budget in 2019.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018632">I think when Canadians hear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> make a promise like that, they expect it to be kept. Particularly when there is a majority government, one would think that would be very attainable. However, not only did the Prime Minister break this important promise, but the budgetary deficits under the Liberal government have been high and onerous for Canadians. In fact, the Prime Minister missed the mark in 2019, despite his promise, by $14 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018633">While reading over the throne speech, I thought I would find the word “balanced” somewhere in there, but no, that word does not appear anywhere in the speech. Then I continued to look for the word “budget”, but there was no mention of the word “budget” either. How could the government leave the word “budget” out of the blueprint for its parliamentary agenda?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018634">To contrast this, in the Conservative government's 2013 throne speech, there was an entire section entitled, “Balanced Budgets and Reducing the Cost of Government”. The Conservatives recognized that in Canada balanced budgets were important because they would leave us prepared in the event of an economic downturn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018635"> What is worse is that in 2015 the Liberal government inherited a balanced budget. Since then, Canada's federal debt has increased by roughly $73 billion. This additional debt has caused taxpayers to pay even more interest. If this trend were to continue, it would be safe to say Canada would have a structural operating deficit, which, considering what the Liberals inherited during a period of economic prosperity, is completely irresponsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018636">It is the government's duty to look out for Canada's future. It is ridiculous that there is not one mention of how the government will budget its promises. I know the Liberal government is used to writing blank cheques, but that is not how Canada and Canadians operate. Canadians spend a lot of time at the kitchen table, finding ways to balance their own budgets and stretching every dollar so they can make it to the end of every month, and save for a rainy day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018637">The government should also be working on finding ways to balance the budget and leave more money in the pockets of Canadians. Canadians know that their hard-earned tax dollars go to pay interest on all this debt. In fact, the interest Canadians paid in 2019 on our massive federal debt was $23.3 billion. This is money that could have been spent on programs that would help Canadians, but rather went to bondholders and bankers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018638"> I know the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is very fond of bragging about our declining debt-to-GDP ratio. It is far easier to talk about something debt related as declining rather than increasing. However, Canadians understand that our national debt is increasing. Our debt-to-GDP ratio will only decline as long as our economy is growing at a pace faster than our debt is rising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018639">Given the economic storm on the horizon, and as our economy slows, soon the declining debt-to-GDP ratio that the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> likes to brag about may no longer be in his very weak arsenal of debate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018640">I also wish to highlight that Statistics Canada reported last week that our job market had lost 71,200 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate rose to 5.9%, the highest in more than a year. This is the largest drop in Canadian employment in a single month in 10 years. These are real people who have to come home and tell their families that they no longer have a job. While the U.S. economy is on the upswing, ours is on the downswing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018641"> As the members opposite scratch their heads, wondering what went wrong, I would suggest a trip out west might help them understand. Alberta's unemployment rate is 7.2%. The housing market is in a downward spiral. People are losing their homes and many of Calgary's downtown office towers sit empty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018642">The Liberal government could continue to look west for an example of how to be financially responsible. As a Manitoban, I understand personally what happens to a government when it does not take financial responsibility seriously. Manitobans toiled under an NDP government for 17 years; a provincial NDP government that taxed and spent, much like the current federal government is doing right now. There were 17 years of debt, decline and decay. The Liberal government appears to be taking Canada on a similar path of financial mismanagement and reckless disregard for the hard-earned tax dollars of all Canadians, and it is very concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018643">However, Premier Pallister and his PC government in my home province of Manitoba brought the province back on track. They are balancing their budget, while continuing to make record investments in health care and education. They continue to do this all while lowering the sales tax to make life easier for all Manitobans. This is what all Canadians should expect from their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018644">Back in 2018, when all this was transpiring, I held out hope and thought that there must be a plan to get the federal budget back to balance. Surely, if anyone was on top of this, it would be the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. However, then I happened to watch a finance committee meeting in which the finance minister was asked over and over again by my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252785" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> about when the budget would be balanced. It seemed like a softball question for our erudite Minister of Finance, yet he could not answer. In fact, by the end, it was apparent he was not interested in the subject at all. Much like last week's throne speech, the minister could not even say the words “balanced budget”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018645">The <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is supposed to be the guardian of the treasury. He is supposed to have his hands on the financial steering wheel of the country, a steady hand. There is no attention being paid to the continued piling on of debt on millennials and future generations of Canadians, and that must stop. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018646">As I begin to close, I would remind members of the House, particularly those on the Liberal side, that it is our duty to serve every Canadian, create opportunity and ensure that the next generation has a brighter future, not led by the debt we leave behind. To do this, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal team must change course. They must put some serious thought into ending this reckless spending and putting forward a serious plan to put Canada's financial and economic future at the forefront.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018648">However, perhaps the member is not familiar with the history of previous Conservative governments and their ability to balance budgets, but I will fill him in a little. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018649">In the last 18 budgets that were introduced by Conservative governments in this very House under Brian Mulroney and Stephen Harper, 16 of them ran deficits. Of the two that run surpluses, one came on the heels of Paul Martin's $13 billion surplus and the other came in 2015 when the Conservatives slashed veteran services and sold off shares of GM at bargain prices so they could balance the budget in time for the election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018650">As the member spent a lot of his time today talking about balancing budgets, I am curious as to why he thinks the Conservatives are in a position to be lecturing on balancing budgets when their track record speaks absolutely nothing to their ability to do it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018651">Mr. Speaker, over here we take no lessons from the Liberal government when it comes to fiscal responsibility. The fact is that when the Liberals took office in 2015, millions of Canadians voted for a prime minister who said that the budget would be balanced in 2019. When one votes based on a promise and that promise is broken, it is a very serious thing, and we all have to recognize that. I do not think anyone on this side of the House will forget about that, because we speak for our constituents. At the doors of my riding, I heard this over and over again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018652">The fact is that in 2015 when the Liberal government took office, it had a balanced budget and it squandered it. The Liberals said that they were lowering taxes for the middle class, but they raised them. Frankly, I do not know how we can take any solace from the comments of the member opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018653"> I would add, just as an aside, that I could get into the litany of problems we are having now economically, but I will just say that 71,000 Canadians lost their job last month and we are not hearing anything from that side of the House about how they are going to fix it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018655">During the last federal campaign, I heard from many people, particularly from young people and those who were particularly concerned about the climate emergency facing our planet. We know that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued some extremely serious and dire warnings that we have 11 years to take serious action now in order to avoid raising global temperatures above 1.5°. If we do not, we risk planetary catastrophe, melting polar ice caps, disappearing coral reefs and mass extinction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018657">Mr. Speaker, the reality is that for countries like Canada to transition to a low-emissions green economy, we need to have the revenue to do it. Countries with smaller GDPs have a harder time converting to green economies because they just do not have the ability to invest in sustainable technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018658"> We had one of the most comprehensive environmental platforms ever tabled by a political party in the history of this country. It was not just a tax on soccer parents; it was a very comprehensive plan. It had some very good things in it. For example, it talked about the green home tax credit, which would affect millions of Canadians and incentivize them to make our homes more fuel efficient. It talked about taking the climate change globally, that a molecule of carbon does not know borders.</ParaText>

I grew up in a working-class family. My father was a truck driver and my mother is an administrative assistant at the local school. I saw first-hand how hard they worked to ensure I had a better future. In fact, there were times when we did not even have enough money to pay for the groceries. Therefore, I am proud to be a member of the governing party that is focused on supporting people who need help the most.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018671">Our government's policies have lifted 250,000 seniors out of poverty. Child poverty in Canada is at an all-time low. At the same time, we have created over one million jobs and unemployment is near an all-time low. We know there is more work to be done, but when we invest in people and put money in the pockets of those who need the help, they spend it and drive our economy forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018672">I am 28 years old. I am one of the youngest members of this House and I am proud to be a member of a party that is taking concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. I want my children and grandchildren to have a future and an environment we are all proud of. In the same breath, we need to be mindful of ensuring that no one is left behind, and that our rural communities and residents can afford our necessary transition. This will not be an easy balance, but it is necessary to ensure we can all move forward united together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018673">Health care is on the minds of Canadians across the country. This was a prominent issue on the doorsteps in Kings—Hants. Recruitment and retention of family physicians in rural areas of our country is a top priority for many. As we know, health care is a challenge not only in Canada but across the western world. While the provinces administer health care, it is vital that the federal government be a willing partner to support their efforts, and I am proud to say that our government has been, and will continue to be, a strong partner with the provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018674">For example, in Nova Scotia, since the Canada health accord was signed in 2016, there has been more money than ever before transferred to the province to support health care. I say this knowing that there is more work to be done. Between our commitment to launch a national pharmacare plan and to provide more money to support the recruitment of rural doctors, I know our efforts will improve health care in this country.</ParaText>

Our government will continue the hard work needed to bring meaningful change and long-lasting opportunities to these communities, which represent the fastest-growing segment of the Canadian population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018677">As part of our government's efforts to make life better for all Canadians, we committed to make historic investments in infrastructure. I am proud to see that work is well under way on significant infrastructure projects in Kings—Hants. The twinning of Highway 101 at Windsor will save lives. The new Lantz interchange will ease traffic congestion. The new recreation complex in Windsor-West Hants and the new aquatic centre in East Hants will increase opportunities for people to lead healthier lives. Completed major projects, like the new interchange in New Minas, the renovated science facility at Acadia University and the rebuilt wharf in Halls Harbour have all led to increased economic prospects. </ParaText>

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Kentville Research and Development Centre has been providing vital support to Nova Scotia's agricultural sector for over 100 years. The facility has developed 60% of the strawberry varieties grown in Canada and identified the Honeycrisp apple, a high-value apple well suited to the maritime climate. </ParaText>

Of course pensions were mentioned, but those areas are probably very complicated and not all seniors are looking at that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018684">The first issue is about affordability for our seniors. When they go to the grocery store, all the prices have gone up because of the carbon tax.

Some seniors become lost physically and mentally, and the government has done nothing to help them so far.</ParaText>

It is an incredible honour to represent such an amazing city in this place. Going door to door and hearing from the residents, it was a much different feeling this time around than the last, when we were running on adrenalin in 2015. However, hearing the concerns, addressing what we have done as a government, going to the polls and coming back with an increased margin really speaks to a lot of what our government has done. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says, for all 338 of us, our time in this place is temporary. I want to thank the people of St. Catharines for the opportunity to represent them here again.</ParaText>

This is not the most family-friendly job and it is difficult on all of our loved ones, on our friends and family.

              <ParaText id="6018704">Four years ago, I ran because I saw a great deal of poverty in my riding. I saw a great deal of concern. I did not like what I was seeing, and that is why I put my name on the ballot. Too many politicians in Niagara were saying that everything was all right, and I did not see it that way. We knocked on a lot of doors. We were elected, and the first thing we did was a middle-class tax cut, lowering taxes on the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1%. That had an impact on people's lives. We coupled that with the Canada child benefit, increases to the guaranteed income supplement for those who need it most and, as my hon. colleague mentioned, lowering the age of eligibility to receive old age security and the guaranteed income supplement back to age 65 after the increase by the previous government. Those policies prevented hundreds of thousands of people from falling into poverty. It had an impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018705">I was happy to see announced today action on increasing the basic personal amount. It is something that we promised in the campaign to bring in as our first act in this Parliament. It will remove 700,000 people from the tax roll. It will help 20 million people save money. It will reduce poverty for tens of thousands of people and could save families $600 a year. We will make sure that it does not go to the highest income earners in this country. This is real action. This is continued action on poverty to help those who need it the most</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018706"> Too often we hear politicians say we need to give tax breaks to the wealthiest and the wealthiest corporations and eventually that will trickle down to the rest of us, to those who need it the most, but we have never seen that. What we have seen over the past four years is that giving money to those who need it most, either through tax breaks or the Canada child benefit, allows those people to spend the money in our economy. Those are people who are going to invest in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018707">They are going to spend it right back, as opposed to saving it for perhaps a vacation or a rainy day. They are going to help stimulate the economy.

              <ParaText id="6018708">Some members have indicated that there was no mention of seniors in the throne speech or no mention of action on seniors. This is going to have a direct benefit on those seniors who are making less than the 1%. For those seniors who do need assistance, it will be money right in their pockets, coupled with pharmacare, which my friend talked about as well. I am sure hon. members of the Conservative Party will take immediate action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018709">What I heard on the streets and at the doors of St. Catharines was that seniors are worried about pharmaceutical prices. They are worried about paying the rent or paying for pharmaceutical drugs. Action on pharmacare is a must. It will have a disproportionate impact on seniors, alleviating many of the costs that they face and many of the costs that they are concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018710">I did mention my kids. What I would like to talk about in terms of the focus of my speech is climate change. It was just my wife and me in 2015, but climate change was always an important issue to me. Looking ahead and after the birth of my son and daughter, I look at this issue through their eyes. Everyone in the House will probably be fine, will probably be okay, but what are we going to give to the next generation? What are we going to give to the generation after that? I talked to a lot of seniors in my riding who agreed with that sentiment. Their time may not be long, but they wanted to know what I was going to do for their grandkids. How are we going to make this a better planet?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018711">I challenged my opponents during the election to name a government that has done more in four years on the environment than our government. No one could provide me with an answer. I will challenge my colleagues on the other side as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018712">We are moving forward on an ambitious plan. Does it mean our plan is perfect? Absolutely not. Does it mean there is more to be done? Absolutely. We are committed to doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018713">The residents of St. Catharines do not have to look far to see the impacts of climate change. In the last three years, we have seen two years of floods and one year of drought. We used to refer to 50-year storms, 100-year storms, but they are happening annually. We need to take action. It worries me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018714">I hear some of the language from members on the the other side who believe climate change is man-made, but then they will use the language of denial. I just heard a member say CO2 has no borders. Does that not mean we need to take action right away? This is the type of language that stalls progress. This is the type of language that hurts our kids and our grandkids. This is the greatest crisis facing Canada. People may throw up their hands and say that is just a bunch of Liberal nonsense. When the chief of the defence staff was asked what was the greatest security threat facing Canada, he answered that it was extreme weather.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018715">Small business organizations and the insurance industry all say we need to take action. Bond and rating agencies are reducing the credit ratings of governments that refuse to take action on climate change. The time is now. I saw in St. Catharines that this was the first election on climate change and the residents of St. Catharines spoke loudly that they want to see action and we are here to deliver. I hope we are able to work across the aisle to deliver on progress that Canadians demand and deserve and that our children and grandchildren deserve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018736">It is a privilege and an honour for me to bring the voices of Vancouver East to Ottawa as their representative. Vancouver East is one of Canada's most diverse and progressive communities in the country. I am so very proud of our record here in Vancouver East. We fight hard for what we believe in. Whether it is with respect to a call for a national affordable housing program, climate action to tackle the climate emergency, justice for indigenous peoples, calling out the government for taking indigenous kids to court, demanding action on the calls for justice for the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, or electoral reform so that every vote would count, we speak with a united and strong voice in Vancouver East on these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018737"> I have no doubt that my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252992" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation>, would join with me on this call as well, and I will be splitting my time with him today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018738">Before I get too deep into the throne speech, I would like to give a shout-out to the Vancouver Japanese Language School and Japanese Hall. Just last month, it was formally designated as a national historic site. People who had been displaced and interned were at the ceremony that day. It was incredibly moving. This recognition is so important on so many levels. It is a piece of history that all Canadians should learn about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018739">On a similar note, I hope the government will also work with the community to get the city's application for Vancouver's Chinatown to be designated as a UNESCO historic site. That would be something that we would all be proud of. It would showcase this diverse and multicultural community and the Canadians who helped contribute in building this great nation of ours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018740">Today, we are in a minority government situation. The people of Canada have sent a clear message to the current government: business as usual is not good enough. We all listened intently to the throne speech that was delivered last week. Unfortunately, like me, the people of Vancouver East were left wanting after this throne speech. Over the last four years, we have heard lots of pretty words and big talk. Sadly, there were no actions to match those words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018741">For example, the throne speech talks about the need for reconciliation. In the last four years, we heard over and over again that the new nation-to-nation relationship is the most important relationship for the Liberal government, yet over and over again we saw the government fail to take action to match those words. If reconciliation is the most important thing for the current government, then why on earth is it continuing to take indigenous children to court? How does that make sense? How does it justify that kind of action? Why is it the people in Grassy Narrows, who are suffering from mercury poisoning, are not getting immediate action from the government so they can have clean drinking water? I do not mean a bottle of water; I mean a permanent solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018742">Why are indigenous people continuing to live in poverty and in mouldy housing? Canada is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. In Vancouver alone, this year's homeless count identified more than 2,000 homeless people and more than 600 who are living on the streets, 40% of whom are indigenous. With indigenous women and girls getting murdered and going missing, reconciliation means that indigenous people must have access to safe housing. All Canadians across the board are being hit by the housing crisis. High rents and low vacancy rates mean that even working professionals have precarious housing. Never mind saving for ownership, many people are one paycheque away from being homeless themselves. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6018743">Almost one in four homeless in Vancouver are actually seniors. Imagine that: seniors today are finding themselves in the streets without a home, and the number is growing. To address the crisis today, we need robust funding for the whole spectrum of housing, from social housing to co-op housing to purpose-built rentals, and real paths to home ownership for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018744"> We want no more delaying of funding flow and no more rhetorical advantages, double-counting or word games. It is not good enough that the Liberals choose to spend 19% less than the Harper government on affordable housing and that much of this decline was in programs that are targeted to low-income households. It is not good enough that we saw a $325-million, 14% reduction in funding for assistance for housing needs programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018745">According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, it is clear that the vast majority of the remaining national housing strategy funding will not flow until after 2024. That is another election cycle away. Funding in 2024 will not help anyone in my community struggling to find affordable housing today, tomorrow, next week, next year or the year after. They cannot wait years. They need action now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018746">We need emergency funding so that we can build modular housing for the people in Oppenheimer Park. These are people who have been living in tents for more than a year now, and the cold and wet weather is here. Imagine that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018747">The 58 West Hastings project has been waiting for federal funding for years now. We have funding commitment from the city and we have funding commitment from the province, but the federal government is missing in action. It is nowhere to be found. We need the federal government at the table, working with the city, the province and the non-profits to deliver housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018748">UNYA, the Urban Native Youth Association, is a fantastic organization in my riding that has been working diligently to support urban indigenous at-risk youth. Its space is oversubscribed and it needs a new centre. Youth need safe housing as well. The city and the province are in support of its work, and again we need the federal government at the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018749">In Vancouver East there are some 47 co-ops, with a total of over 1,600 units. All but five were constructed before the Liberals cancelled the national affordable housing program in 1993. The Liberals also promised in 2015 to renew operating agreements with Canada's co-op housing providers. Unfortunately, they only signed short-term agreements, and now we are back to where we started. Real action is needed. We need long-term agreements and stable funding with subsidies so that we can ensure that the existing units remain affordable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018750">In short, homelessness is systemic and structural, caused by a failure of government to meet the needs of the people it serves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018751">I hope we can work together in the minority government in order to better address the housing crisis across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018752">On the opioid crisis, we need the government to get on with it. We need to declare a national health emergency, and it would be so good if, at a minimum, the government got on with a pilot program on safe supply so that we can start the work to save lives. It would be so good for the government to support the front-line workers who are burning out there right now by providing resources to them so that they can continue with this critical work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018753">Let us not judge people for who they are. Let us get on with saving lives. Let us look at each other with humanity and say that we can do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018754">On pharmacare, I challenge any member in this House to tell me that they did not come across someone at a doorstep who said that they needed affordable medication. The government can do this. It has been promising this for decades. The New Democrats have been pushing this hard. Our critic for health has been pushing this hard. I urge the government to utilize this minority government to make that happen: single-payer, universal pharmacare for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018755">Today we also put forward a suggestion on dental care. Instead of giving a tax reduction for people earning over $140,000 on their annual income, let us reduce that to $90,000, and let us redirect those dollars so that we can bring forward a dental care program that will support some 4.3 million people in Canada.

For whatever drug they would prescribe, individuals would be able to access that medication through pharmacare to manage their addiction. That is what we are talking about in order to save lives.</ParaText>

We have the fentanyl crisis, and some 12,000 people have died across this country. It is not just in the Downtown Eastside. It is in all of our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018768">I call on the government to announce a pilot program, at the very minimum. Let us do it in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside with a safe-supply program to save lives. Let us show the rest of the country how this could be done without judgment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018773">On the issue around dental care and how people deal with a dental issue, it will make a difference in their lives, and not just at that moment. Dental care can build up their confidence, and it has life-long implications. If we address dental issues now, it can prevent other illness down the road, which will save money in the health care system. As well, I have people in my community today who, because of their dental issues and the lack of dental services, are unable to apply for employment. They are embarrassed about their teeth and do not have the confidence to apply for employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018774">I think that by doing this, we will actually save money down the road. It is the right thing to do. The formula that the NDP has put forward is one that would work. Let us cap the tax changes at $90,000. Then that money, the $1.6 billion that would be saved from that change, could be invested into a dental care program that would support some 4.3 million Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

If this throne speech is all the Liberals are willing to offer, then it is simply not good enough for the people in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018780">The Liberals had a real chance with this throne speech to make a commitment to help Canadians deal with the challenges that they are facing right now. Instead, they completely ignored the message that they heard from Canadians during the election. These are broken promises again in the early going. We cannot have these pretty words without concrete actions. Canadians expect more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018781">Almost half of Canadians in every part of this country are $200 away from not being able to pay their bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018782">We see the effects and the urgency of the climate crisis all around us. Young people are taking to the streets. They are worried about their future. In downtown Courtenay just last week, Youth Environmental Action was calling for the government to take urgent action. Instead what we received in the government's platform was a date of 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018783">What this group was expecting, and what we were all hoping for, was to see the sense of urgency, to see what has been recommended by the IPCC in terms of reducing emissions by 45% by 2030. We did not hear anything about that. Instead of working with us to help make Canadians' lives better, the Liberals offered more empty words and no indication of any real action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018784">We hear Liberal members talk about their pharmacare plan but there really is no language about any universal, comprehensive or public pharmacare plan. There is no funding amount and no timeline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018785">I hear from people in my riding. I heard from a young mother who has a child with cystic fibrosis. She simply cannot afford the medicine. When children cannot afford to get the medicine they need in a country as wealthy as Canada, we are failing miserably.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018786">In terms of the environment, the Liberals have given billions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies instead of investing in renewable energy and job creation. There is nothing on stronger emissions around 2030 and nothing to confront the urgency of the problem that is facing us right now. Instead, the Liberals continue to give massive subsidies to the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018787">The Liberals failed to work with us to make sure that the ultrarich pay a little more. Instead, the Liberals continue to throw away and write off billions in corporate debt that is owed to Canadians. They could have worked with us to stop profiting off Canadians who struggle continually to pay off their own debts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018788">In terms of reconciliation, the Liberals continue to cite that their most important relationship is with indigenous people. The Liberals are refusing to stop dragging indigenous children to court. They refuse to commit to dropping the appeal against fairness for indigenous children. They are also failing by refusing to fix the problem with the child welfare system. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018790">Instead of choosing to honour the courts, the government continues to fight them and spend taxpayers' money. The Nuu-chah-nulth want to share. They want to walk together. They want to be out on the water fishing, where they belong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018791">In terms of housing, the Liberals failed to deliver a real concrete plan. We need 500,000 housing units right now to make up for the last 25 years. We need co-op housing. I am a product of co-op housing and we desperately need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018792">In Courtenay, there is a conversation right now about the need for co-op housing and federal help. The government made a promise to end veteran homelessness. There is nothing in the throne speech about veteran homelessness. We also know a lot of indigenous people are living in terrible housing conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018793"> I heard my friend from <Affiliation DbId="252890" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> talk about the opioid crisis and seeking a pilot project on a clean source of supply. Over 12,000 Canadians have lost their lives unnecessarily to a poisoned drug supply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018794">We also need therapeutic recovery communities like there are in Italy and Portugal, where they have been able to reduce the number of overdose deaths. In Canada, especially in British Columbia, people are 79 times more likely to die of an overdose. Seven times means we got it wrong, but 79 times means we need to ask who is accountable. We need to take urgent action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018795">I have to highlight the biggest thing that is missing for the west coast in this Speech from the Throne. There is no mention of the salmon emergency, none. The member for <Affiliation DbId="253074" Type="2">West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country</Affiliation> yesterday talked for 20 minutes and did not mention the salmon emergency taking place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018796">I had the privilege today to sit down with the new <Affiliation DbId="253373" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> and I called on her to take action. This is as big as a forest fire taking place in northern Alberta or flooding in eastern Canada. There is a billion-dollar salmon economy in British Columbia. It is not just our economy. It is our food security, our culture and our way of life. Everything is interconnected in our ecosystem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018797">There was the lowest return in the Fraser this year in recorded history. It was not just the lowest return. It was half the lowest return. In the Skeena, there were record lows. In the Alouette River, 60,000 chum were expected and 450 came back. There was the Big Bar slide, and now we are hearing most of the fish did not make it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018798">This is a catastrophic time. The government does not want to be the government that watched the west coast and the Pacific salmon go the way of the Atlantic cod. We need the government to act with the sense of urgency that is taking place on the west coast right now. I am appealing to the Liberals. This is not about blame or shame. This is about doing the right thing right now. We need action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018799">The government announced its salmon restoration funds, whether it be the B.C. salmon restoration fund or the coastal restoration fund. That money simply is not flowing. There are tons of volunteers out there trying to do the good work and they are not seeing that money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018800">There were over 60 people in Ucluelet with the Central Westcoast Forest Society in Clayoquot and Barkley out on Saturday. They removed 23,000 tonnes of plastic and debris from the steams so the fish would return. A simple $102 million from the federal government is not enough. We need $500 million right now, just in restoration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018801">The enhancement groups have not seen a raise in over 29 years while there is an urgent situation. The catching and retention of marked fish is not allowed. It does not make sense. We should mark every fish from every hatchery and make sure that the fish are allowed to be kept by our sports fishers. That will help in conservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018802">The government made a commitment that it would remove salmon farms by 2025. There is nothing in the Speech from the Throne on that, despite the fact that we are seeing a record number of sea lice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018803">The government still allows the transfer of fish that are infected with PRV, a disease. We have seen massive die-offs with algal bloom. This is happening along migratory routes of juvenile salmon and the government is acting as a double agent. It is acting as an agent for the industry, yet it says it is there to protect our wild stocks. It was recommended by the Cohen commission that the government cannot play that double role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018804">The government is allowing the herring fishery to open right now, unless we hear different. This is fundamental because everything is interconnected. It is the bedrock species for salmon and southern resident killer whales. It is a reduction fishery and it does not make sense. New Democrats are calling on the government to listen to local and indigenous knowledge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018805">We need the government to highlight that there is a salmon emergency going on in British Columbia and it needs to announce that right away. The government is needed on the ground.</ParaText>

The government put forward a motion to end homelessness for veterans. Where is the plan? It wants to do it by 2025. We want to hear the plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018812">The government is still only meeting six of the 24 service standards. While it is taking pride in its track record on veterans, maybe it could do something about it. It could take the money from the end of last year and apply it to meeting the 18 of the 24 service standards it is not meeting.

              <ParaText id="6018814">Two weeks ago, I was visited by a large group of citizens who are very concerned about the continued use of open-net fish farms in British Columbia and the devastating impact it is having on our wild salmon.

              <ParaText id="6018815">My question really is about housing, because that is literally the number one issue that I heard on the campaign trail. In my riding we have very many successful co-ops that were built with federal funds in the 1970s and 1980s and provided thousands of affordable units for families of all types. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018818">Back in the seventies and eighties, when he was talking about that era, over 10% of our housing stock was non-market housing. Most of it was co-op housing. Today, we are at 3%. In Europe, they are at 30%. Europe sees housing as something that is a right, that everybody deserves safe, secure and affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018819">Making sure we have non-market co-op housing ensures that people will have a safe, secure place to live. It works because we can have all different types of income levels living in a housing co-op, all different types of needs in a housing co-op. We can build them right across the country, like we did in the seventies and eighties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018820">Of the many people who I talked to who are privileged to live in co-op housing today, a lot of them graduated into the free market, and a lot of those who could not are still living there today.

They have chosen very wisely in this Parliament to make sure that their voice is heard on the floor of the House of Commons in the Parliament of Canada. Albertans will no longer be taken advantage of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018825">Before I continue, Madam Speaker, I want to say that I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252627" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation>. I am sure he will have many important contributions to make to this debate, and also no doubt will provide the perspective of Ontarians on what their expectations are in the Parliament of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018826">The Speech from the Throne was a very deep disappointment, a slap in the face to Albertans. We have faced some of the hardest economic times our province has faced in multiple generations. Albertans are used to downturns in the oil and gas sector. They are used to downturns in the energy sector. That is nothing new. When I moved to Alberta in 2005, it was something that every single energy worker would tell me. I remember in the last downturn, they would say to save for the next downturn, to put aside some money to weather it. It would come and go and the boom would come back. Projects would get built. We would have new opportunities to grow the economy to create well-paying middle-class jobs in the energy sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018827">We have seen a government in the past four years that has failed to do that. We have seen a government that has made it its intention to phase out the energy sector, despite the fact that oil and gas companies invest in renewable energy and invest in their people. We will find no other companies as interested in maximizing the knowledge, the abilities and the type of work that people will be doing. I always tell people back home and all those whom I visit all across Canada that we spent a generation convincing young men and women that it was worth their while to pursue a degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics because there would be well-paying jobs waiting for them when they finished. When they went into the private sector, they had co-operative jobs and internships ready to go. Some of them did not even finish their degrees and they already had six-figure salaries in engineering jobs waiting for them in oil and gas at the Suncors of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018828"> Now we have heard terrible news. Haliburton announced that it was shutting down its cement operations in Alberta. We have news from companies like Suncor Energy. Encana has renamed itself and is moving to the United States. It has already moved most of its board of directors down there. Decisions are being made there for a Canadian company. It was once what we would say in French <I>le fleuron</I>, the main natural gas company in Canada and now those decisions are being made in Denver. Trans Canada dumped “Canada” from its name because it no longer has faith in doing business in Canada. Now it is called TC Energy to hide the fact to American investors that it is a Canadian-based company. That is a lost opportunity. I have come here to make sure that opportunity rings out again in these hallways and that there is opportunity for Albertans within Confederation, within a united Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018829"> On every single street I was on and at most of the doors I went to, people would talk about it. People are fed up with being taken advantage of. I have said on the floor of the House of Commons before that people in Alberta are tired of being treated like colonials. We are not colonials. We have made an immense contribution to Canada. Over $600 billion has been transferred out of our province. Albertans do complain about it; it is just something that we do. It is true. We want to be able to create the wealth and then we are okay to share a slice of that wealth with the rest of Canada to make a contribution to Confederation. We contribute more than our fair share right now and all we are asking is that the government listen. Premier Kenney, who is here today in Ottawa, is making five simple requests, none of which happened to be in the throne speech. The federal government has listened to none of them. These are not new things. These are things that the premier has repeatedly asked for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018830">One request is to remove the cap on the stabilization fund. The Government of Alberta at the moment is forced into deficit spending as it is closing its deficit, which is something the current federal government is incapable of doing. Removing the cap on the stabilization fund would allow the province to get that money back, the “over-contribution”, I would call it, into Confederation, so that we can stabilize our health care system, our education system and the social services that Albertans depend on. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018831"> These are extremely important things that must be done. The premier has asked for a major significant amendment to Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> to ensure that certain major projects will not fall under the Bill C-69 rules. The “no pipelines” bill, as it is called in Alberta, ensures that there are no new projects being proposed. When I go into downtown Calgary and I talk to managers, directors and people making the decisions on whether to pursue a project in Canada, they say that there is no thought about any new projects being suggested for the Canadian market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018832">Most of the well-paying jobs in the oil and gas sector are in construction. Brand new projects that come online cost tens of thousands so that people can be hired for the length of the construction season to build it. For the past four years, all the government has to show for it is that it has expropriated one pipeline company and taken over Kinder Morgan's TMX contract. After dithering for years and trying to block the pipeline from being built, suddenly, the Liberal Party had a deathbed conversion. Suddenly the government is now in favour of building a pipeline, but only one pipeline. It cancelled energy east. It cancelled Enbridge's northern gateway. It cancelled more kilometres of pipeline than it actually had built. The only one that is kind of pitter-pattering away on getting built is really the last major energy infrastructure project in Canada. The same thing happened with LNG with well-paying jobs. For a generation we have been convincing people to go into the STEMs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018833"> We also spent a heck of a lot of time convincing people to move from other parts of Canada and from parts of the United States to Alberta and earn a living there. We do not have the advantage of beautiful provinces like British Columbia which has the mountains and the ocean. Alberta is just rolling foothills and they are pretty flat on the east side. However, what we did have was an excellent quality of life, an excellent opportunity to work in a sector that was always trying to do its best, on the cutting edge of everything. There are wildlife biologists and people interested in environmental remediation. Those are the people I met at the doors, people who worked for oil and gas companies trying to remediate the land. They were proud of the work they were doing and the contributions they were making to ensure that with every single project that came online, at some point the land would be remediated and returned as close as possible to its original state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018834">Suncor was one of those great companies that managed to do that and earned an environmental certificate two provincial governments ago. Now there are wild bison on the territory, something we had not seen for an extremely long time. It is a bison population, by the way, that is healthier in the wilds of Wood Buffalo National Park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018835">This throne speech has very, very little for Albertans, so we will be looking for the government to actually reach out to Albertans and make an effort, a true effort, at bridging the gap between what Albertans are feeling and seeing on the ground, the experiences they have had over the past four years, and what we expect from the minority Parliament. There is an entire province right now that is feeling neglected. We are not asking for a handout. We are asking for the federal government to get out of our way and let us create the wealth. Let us create the jobs, well-paying private sector jobs that we have been known for over the past two decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018836">It has been amazing to see how fast Calgary has grown even since I moved there. I represent the deep southeast suburbs of Calgary. There are entire communities that did not exist when I moved there. There is a hospital that was built in my riding. It did not exist back in 2005. Some 30,000 to 40,000 people have moved into my area. Cranston, Mahogany, Auburn Bay, Seton, Rangeview and Copperfield are communities that did not exist before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018837">Tens of thousands of people chose Calgary. They chose Alberta for those well-paying jobs in the energy sector. We have diversified our economy much more than people could ever believe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018838">The oil and gas sector is a much smaller proportion of Alberta's economy than it was back in 1997. We have diversified our economy. We were moving in the right direction, and we have a federal government that has impeded our ability to continue to create that wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018839">This throne speech is just not good enough. There is not enough concrete action in it that would actually provide any certainty or comfort for the people back home who have lost their jobs and whose severances have run out. They are finding no opportunities to work in the sector where they have spent 20 years, between their education and their early career opportunities, to actually make something of themselves and contribute to their families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018852">Madam Speaker, I am first going to take exception to the use of language like “climate emergency” to describe the real problems of climate change. Often I get emails and they are usually form emails from people who have good-hearted concerns about the environment. They are worried about climate change. I believe, in their hearts, they really are worried, but the language of “emergency” and “crisis” is often used to suggest massive government interference in the economy and the government dictating to provinces and companies what they will and will not do. I reject the whole premise underlying the notion that this is the only way we can address climate change as an issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018853">I also want to reject the notion that it is up to the government to provide what is called a “just transition”, which I think is a very subjective term in the first place. We have people who are looking to international markets and the International Energy Agency says that for the foreseeable future, the demand for both natural gas and oil is going up, not down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018854">The expectation all across the world is that the world will need more energy, not less.

              <ParaText id="6018858">I am going to seize upon one of the quotes from the throne speech, which I actually took away in a positive sense. The throne speech ended with a remarkable passage by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's speech at the opening of the Centennial Flame, just beside us in West Block, which read:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018859">

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018860">The irony is that speech was kicking off our centennial year, lighting a centennial flame using natural gas from Canada. I am not sure that irony was found by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office when it chose that aspirational quote, but that was how people celebrated. The Centennial Flame has all of our provinces and territories, now including Nunavut, around it and is burning Canadian natural gas, allowing that fountain to burn throughout the coldest winters in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018861">Earlier in that speech, Pearson complimented our industrial capacity and our resourcefulness as a country. Sometimes we have to ask what was said before the quote that the government used for its throne speech. In the same speech, kicking off the celebration of Canadian natural gas in many ways, Pearson said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018863">That was Lester B. Pearson's remark, speaking about the balance that Canada had been able to have by being resourceful, tapping our natural resources and being industrial, celebrating our industrial sectors, in order to provide for the welfare of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018864">One thing people on this side of the House have been saying, both through the first term of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this one, and what is missing in the throne speech, is recognizing the economic diversity of this country. There is no mention of the serious national unity issues we are facing as a result of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government's opposition to our resource sector in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and beyond. There is not one mention of it.

              <ParaText id="6018865">The Premier of Alberta is in Ottawa today. Alberta has been very proud to share not just that wealth with the rest of the country as part of the resourcefulness of its industry, but at times, when the auto industry was struggling in my province, more manufacturing jobs in Ontario were attributable to our western resource industry than into auto assembly. When our national economy was struggling, the global recession, it was actually our resource economy that allowed us to lead the G7. That is allowing new dimensions of progress, embracing that. </ParaText>

In the Prime Minister's first speech abroad as the Canadian prime minister, at Davos in January 2016, he said, “My predecessor wanted you to know Canada for its resources.

              <ParaText id="6018869">What was disturbing was that only a few minutes after he went to an international forum, he essentially attacked his predecessor.

We know press releases often will say “check against delivery”. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> delivered something that he should not have delivered.

Here is a quote I used four years ago, which rings even more true today, from Robert Stanfield in March, 1969. He said, “Let us be quite clear that national unity does not mean uniting most of Canada against part of it.” What wise words when the division in the country at that time was caused by a Trudeau, Pierre Trudeau, and I can say that safely in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018871">We see that in practice from the present <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from his first speech at Davos, playing off resourcefulness and the resource sector as if steam-assisted gravity drainage and the ability of our oil sands to minimize the mining operations, minimize water usage and minimize greenhouse gas, those innovations somehow did not count to the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018872">The resourcefulness of our resource sector and the capital markets that developed in Canada as a result of our resources have given us the new dimensions of welfare that Lester Pearson talked about on the eve of Canada's centennial.</ParaText>

We have the collapse of our salmon sector, as everyone heard me say earlier. We have a salmon emergency taking place. The fishers, the people trying to make a living, have had no help from Ottawa. EI was not extended. The commercial fishing season was extended to August 20 and they did not get any support. Fishers are losing their boats and homes, and the government is completely absent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018886"> We need an emergency package for those fishers and their families, to get people back to work and restoration. We need to take concrete action, fix the mismanagement that took place over decades by both Liberal and Conservative governments, take a whole-of-ecosystem approach and protect the bedrock species on which salmon rely. We need urgent action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018887">Does my colleague and the Conservative caucus join me in calling on the federal government to come up with an emergency package in light of the fact that we have had half of the lowest return in recorded history in the Fraser, which is the world's largest salmon river? I hope my colleague will join me in the call to action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018888">Madam Speaker, my colleague from British Columbia mentioned the importance of fishing and our offshore resources. These are types of resources of which we should be proud. We should manage them effectively and give predictability to families that rely on that industry. That is our economic diversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018889">He also mentioned softwood lumber and the lumber industry. This is a government that when renegotiating the most important economic agreement upon which Canada relies, the NAFTA agreement, it did not mention softwood lumber as a priority. It did not mention the auto industry as a priority. It did not mention the resource industry as a priority or agriculture for that matter. It put in the progressive agenda that was more about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own brand and political opportunity than anything else. We have seen that same approach fail in China and India. It is about time the Liberals put Canadian jobs and opportunity ahead of their own political fortunes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6018893">I am honoured to rise today for the first time in the House to represent my constituents in Sherbrooke, who are engaged, dynamic people. I want to take a moment to congratulate Kim Boutin of Sherbrooke, who won several medals this weekend at the short track speed skating World Cup in Shanghai. She is a model of strength, discipline and determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018894">Now I want to thank some people without whom I could never have aspired to represent the people of Sherbrooke. First I want to thank my family, who have given me support and unconditional love throughout my journey into politics. I also want to thank all of the volunteers, as well as my campaign team, who worked non-stop to share our vision of Sherbrooke and Canada. Thanks to their excellent work, we were able to convince the people of Sherbrooke that we were the best team to represent them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018895">My team and I have been on the job since October 22. I plan to be very active and present in my riding, to listen to people's concerns and to advocate for their projects and issues.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6018896">I want to do my part to build a better future for my community, for Sherbrooke, for Quebec, for our country, for our planet and first and foremost for the next generations. This is why I chose to enter politics.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6018897">I have a clear plan and vision for Sherbrooke. I will use my term to propose several initiatives. Without a doubt, the main issue that pushed me to run for office is the environment. I love nature and outdoor activities, so the issue of climate change really resonates with me. I wanted to be part of the team put together by our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has a real plan for Canada and who is leading the fight against climate change. Every action counts, no matter how small or large.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018898">We must continue the electrification of public transit in Sherbrooke, particularly with hybrid buses, ban single-use plastics, and promote and support the development of green technologies by getting behind our university and college researchers. Above all, we must continue engaging with Canadians to make them aware of the challenges involved in the fight against climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018899">The status of women is also a key issue for me. I am proud to be part of a political party that is not afraid to introduce feminist policies. Consider, for example, Canada's feminist international assistance policy, brought forward by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252974" Type="2">Compton—Stanstead</Affiliation>. The presence of women in the public arena, and particularly in politics, is a very important issue. I want to work with my colleagues to improve how we do things, so that young women and young mothers can become MPs without neglecting their families. We need to continue to encourage women to run for office, and I want to serve as a positive role model for anyone who wishes to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018900">Another important challenge relates to the labour shortage and immigration. We must continue to welcome newcomers with generosity and support the harmonious integration of immigrants into our society. Throughout my campaign I had the opportunity to meet business people, and many of them talked about the labour shortage. They all expressed an openness towards welcoming immigrant workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018901">Lastly, there is also economic development. We need to make Sherbrooke a centre of innovation and research and development for green technology industries. We also need to support economic development by supporting innovative start-ups. The strategic innovation fund is already helping many businesses in the region, and our government will build on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018902">Our Prime Minister's throne speech was unifying. Our government's priorities, including the fight against climate change and lower taxes for the middle class, reflect the priorities of the people of Sherbrooke, and that is why I am going to support it. </ParaText>

That changed when Parliament approved a two-year pilot project to create new opportunities for parliamentarians to review the government's spending plans. One of the benefits of the pilot project was that the budget items could be included in the main estimates, which would allow parliamentarians from all parties and Canadians to see how the spending estimates were linked to the overview included in the estimates of the Minister of Finance's budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018974">In fact, this year's main estimates included the entire $5.6 billion in spending measures announced in the 2019 spring budget.

We will review with opposition parties the results of the pilot project as we continue to work toward improving how we report to parliamentarians and Canadians and how we can be even more transparent on government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6018976">Turning to the estimates themselves, as tabled in Parliament, the supplementary estimates (A), 2019-20, include a summary of the government's incremental financial requirements as well as an overview of major funding requests and horizontal initiatives.

Transport Canada is seeking an increase of $227.1 million in the supplementary estimates. This includes $223.9 million in voted appropriations for 12 different items.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019108">At this time, I will focus my remarks on the department's three largest items.

              <ParaText id="6019109"> The Government of Canada's incentives for zero-emission vehicles program helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to an environmentally responsible transportation network by promoting the adoption of this type of vehicle. Between May 1, when the program was launched, and November 24, 30,000 Canadian individuals and businesses received the point-of-sale incentive. Canada made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The incentives for zero-emission vehicles program will help us meet that target.<Sup /></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019110">To meet the demand for incentives, Transport Canada has had to advance funding from future years. Canadians understand that protecting the environment and growing the economy go hand in hand. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project has the potential to create thousands of good middle-class jobs and generate billions of dollars to help fund clean energy solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019111">To address marine safety and environmental concerns raised about the Trans Mountain expansion project by indigenous groups, Transport Canada is leading on three measures: providing indigenous coastal communities with access to web-based maritime information; funding for marine safety equipment and training; and, finally, supporting a demonstration to advance low-noise and low-emission crude oil tankers servicing the Trans Mountain expansion. This includes up to $30 million to support the crude oil tanker technology demonstration program, which will support the construction of next-generation quiet vessel tankers powered by liquefied natural gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019112">Reducing underwater noise and air emissions from those tankers will help mitigate the impacts of marine shipping on the environment, including vulnerable marine mammals such as the southern resident killer whale. Another $1.5 million will support the enhanced maritime situational awareness initiative, allowing three more indigenous communities to become pilot host communities. These funds will allow the department to continue to develop meaningful relationships with indigenous communities through the project.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019113">I am proud to point out that Canada has one of the safest rail networks in the world, due in part to initiatives like the rail safety improvement program, which provides funding to improve rail safety security and reduce injuries and fatalities related to rail transportation. The program funds various activities, including roadway and intersection improvements, such as adding sidewalks, diversion roads, flashing lights, bells, gates and even full pedestrian overpasses, the adoption of innovative safety technologies for detection, data recording and communication, and research or studies related to enhancing the safety of rail lines. In the supplementary estimates, Transport Canada is seeking to defer nearly $10.5 million to reimburse funding recipients for eligible expenses that they incurred but have not yet submitted for reimbursement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019114">Other important measures include $1.5 million to help Transport Canada continue its work to protect and recover southern resident killer whales. This funding for the whales initiative would reduce the economic impacts on the shipping industry of an expanded voluntary vessel slowdown off the coast of British Columbia. Through a contribution agreement, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority would administer funds to eligible vessel operators to offset the additional pilotage costs from participating in the slowdown.</ParaText>

We have some challenges bringing caregivers into this country because in some cases it means a separation from their families who are living abroad. One thing we have looked into is finding a way to bring their families with them and to give them work and student permits so that they can be unified with the caregiver who has come to Canada to work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019142">Mr. Chair, this is a long-standing social contract that exists between the Canadian Armed Forces and our provincial governments in the delivery of health care across this country. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces are paid for out of the national defence budget. The cost of taking care of people who are not within the public health insurance programs that we have across this country is the cost that it is. That is how hospitals reach the decision of how much they pay for visitors who are not Canadian and do not pay into our health insurance programs. However, neither do those under national defence, because they often require greater care. We try to take care of them as best we can within the military hospitals on base, but when they require extra services, special attention and specialists, it is in the military's best interest to get those from the public hospital system. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019180">Mr. Chair, as we know, in the last Parliament, we learned about Vice-Admiral Mark Norman getting treated very horribly by the Liberal government. Of course, it had to make a settlement and apologize for the way that it treated the vice-admiral. Under Vote 1A, there is a program called “Funding to better transition Canadian Armed Forces members, Veterans and their families to post-military life”. Is that where the money to settle out of court with Mark Norman came from?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019181">Mr. Chair, supporting the families of our Canadian Armed Forces members is extremely important. That is one of the reasons why we put the families of our members in our defence policies, so that they can actually get support. That policy allows us to give the right support and this is something that is extremely important because we ask our Canadian Armed Forces members to do very difficult things on our behalf, even when it comes to training. Therefore, we want to make sure that their family life is well looked after.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019186">Congratulations once again, Mr. Chair. I think this is our fourth time in committee of the whole together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019187">It has been an absolute privilege and an honour to be reappointed as the Minister of National Defence to serve our women and men in the Canadian Armed Forces. As I stated to many members, I welcome input from all members of Parliament in the House when it comes to serving our Canadian Armed Forces members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019188">I am eager to continue to implement Canada's defence policy, Strong, Secure, Engaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019189"> Strong, Secure, Engaged is a rigorously costed and funded transparent vision for the next 20 years of our Canadian Armed Forces. We are increasing our spending by 70% to ensure that our women and men in uniform have what they need to do the important job that we ask of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019190">Our work is not just about defence. It is about positioning Canada for success in an uncertain world. Canadians know that we cannot be an island of stability in an ocean of turmoil. Eventually those negative ripples of conflict will reach our shores. It is about promoting the values and interests that are core to Canada's prosperity and security. It is about standing with our partners and allies as we put Canada's expertise to work on a global scale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019191">Today, through our supplementary estimates, I am requesting $463.6 million for national defence so the Canadian Armed Forces can continue their work. I make this request confident in the benefits and flexibility of the defence funding model. We only ask for funds when we need them. We make adjustments as requirements evolve. Savings are reallocated and earmarked funding is protected until we are ready to spend it. We do not leave money on the table. These supplementary funds will allow us to continue implementing Canada's defence policy, directly supporting our people and their families, expanding our capabilities and equipping our defence team to address the threats of the modern security environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019192">First, we must invest in our people and their families. A resilient, inclusive and diverse defence team is critical to Canada's security and we are proud of our progress to support our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019193">Just this summer, Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document> received royal assent, marking a historic evolution of the military justice system and enshrining rights for victims into that system. We are working to right past wrongs as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019194">The Canada pride citations are a tangible way to recognize the contributions of former LGBTQ2 members whose service careers were cut short due to discriminatory policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019195">Two weeks ago, the Federal Court approved the final settlement agreement of the Canadian Armed Forces DND sexual misconduct class action lawsuit. We hope this settlement will bring closure, healing and acknowledgement to our members who were harmed by sexual misconduct in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019196">These are just a few of our efforts to ensure a safe, welcoming and inclusive workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019197">We also recognize the critical jobs our reservists play, which is why we restructured reserve pay to better align with the regular force, ensuring the same pay for the same day's work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019198">Last year, we reintroduced the veteran's service card and set up the Canadian Armed Forces transition group to better support armed forces members and their families alongside their journey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019199">We will be building on these initiatives. We are requesting just over $179 million in voting and statutory appropriations to fund recruitment, retention and other initiatives to support our people and their families, including competitive salaries and benefits, training and expanded transition resources. Investing in our people is not only the right thing to do, but it is necessary to grow our defence team to the size it needs to be to face the challenges of tomorrow, something we promised in SSE. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019200">Taking care of people also means equipping them to do their jobs. This summer I was pleased to announce $250 million to upgrade reserve infrastructures across Canada over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019201">So far in 2019-20, we have invested over $440 million in major construction and maintenance and repair projects. All infrastructure projects are done with an eye toward greening defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019202">While some parties continue to ignore the science on climate change and offer no plan to tackle this global challenge, our government is taking action against climate change. Our innovate energy performance contracts at wings and bases across the country are helping us to meet our climate objectives, while producing economic benefits for communities and creating significant long-term cost savings for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6019203">Our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint have put us on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. These estimates also include $27.7 million for our ongoing project to replace the jetties at CFB Esquimalt so that our navy's infrastructure will be ready to accommodate existing and future ships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019204">As climate change contributes to a more accessible Arctic, we are also investing in the north, and that is why we are helping upgrade the Inuvik airport runway and why we have built the Nanisivik refuelling facility. These investments do more than help us defend our sovereignty and contribute to continental defence. These investments build relationships with our indigenous peoples who live in the north. They help us create jobs and economic opportunities and maintain access for all Canadians who live and work in those communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019205">Our new Arctic and offshore patrol ships and projects like over-the-horizon radar technology will enhance our operating and surveillance capabilities in that vast and challenging environment. These estimates include $8.3 million for remotely piloted aircraft systems to further enable long-range intelligence and surveillance in Canada and on deployments. We are requesting $26.4 million to ensure that our CF-18s remain operational and interoperable with our allies until our new fighter fleet is ready. We are requesting $3.2 million to advance the Canadian surface combatant project, along with $177 million to support and upgrade the armoured combat support vehicle fleet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019206">The latter highlights the flexibility of the defence policy's funding model, which would allow us to begin this project five years sooner than anticipated. This would save us money that would have been spent maintaining an aging fleet. The project would benefit Canadians, supporting over 10,000 well-paying middle-class jobs across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019207"> Even with all the right people and all the right resources, Canada cannot tackle modern defence challenges alone. Global instability is heightened by the effects of climate change and scarcity. Rapid advances in technology bring both opportunity and risk. We face threats to democracy and challenges to the rules-based international order. In this environment, we must be innovative and collaborative, working across departments, across disciplines and across borders. That is why we are committed to being a reliable partner and a responsible global citizen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019208">These estimates include roughly $42 million as Canada's contribution to support the NATO common services, like military equipment and infrastructure. Our current contributions to NATO are significant. Commodore Kurtz is currently leading the Standing NATO Maritime Group Two. Major-General Jennie Carignan is leading the training mission in Iraq. Our contributions to NATO will be leading a battle group in Latvia and supporting our air policing in Romania. We are rejoining the NATO AWACS program that the previous government pulled out of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019209">This summer, we completed our United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali and began providing tactical airlift support to other United Nations missions as part of Operation Presence in Uganda. We continue to advance the Vancouver principles and the women, peace and security agenda. As part of the Elsie initiative, Canadian Armed Forces has partnered with Ghana Armed Forces to find innovative solutions to overcome barriers to women's participation in peace operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019210"> To grow representation of women in peacekeeping, it means increasing the number of women who serve in our armed forces. That is why we will focus on growing the representation of women in the Canadian military to at least 25% of the total force by 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019211">I have barely scratched the surface of all the great work and collaboration happening across the security defence community as part of our SSE implementation. There is much more work to be done. The security challenges we face today are diverse, complex and far-reaching. They pose serious threats to our collective security and prosperity, so it is imperative that we invest in the right equipment, capabilities and initiatives to enable our women and men in uniform to do the difficult jobs that we ask of them. The additional $463.6 million is necessary to deliver on our commitment to support our people so they can continue to protect Canadians and advance peace and security at home and abroad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019297">This evening I would like to talk about the government's commitments to reconciliation with indigenous peoples and how items included in the supplementary estimates (A), 2019-20, support our shared journey of healing and accelerate self-determination for first nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019298">As we begin this new session of Parliament, I would like to reiterate that our government's commitment to reconciliation with indigenous people is as strong as ever. This government continues to place the utmost importance on the relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples. Reconciliation is too important to be a partisan issue, and I look forward to working with all parliamentarians across party lines to make significant and tangible progress on this journey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019299">A significant demonstration of our commitment is the fact that I address the committee today as the federal government's principal interlocutor with first nations, Inuit and Métis people, and not as the minister of Indian affairs. I am delighted to say that I was the very last minister to carry that title, and this past July the order in council was finalized to dissolve the archaic department known as INAC and establish new ministerial responsibilities for the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and the <Affiliation DbId="253378" Type="4">Minister of Indigenous Services</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019300">Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, INAC, was a vestige of colonial times. It was created to enforce the Indian Act and was in no way able to support indigenous peoples or establish partnerships in connection with their history, their situation and their particular aspirations. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6019301">I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish working in true partnership with indigenous peoples. Together we have made significant progress but we still have much work to do. We must keep moving forward with a new level of commitment, determination and partnership. Above all, we must continue to build trust through stronger, more collaborative relationships with indigenous peoples, relationships founded on respect, co-operation, partnership and, above all, the affirmation of indigenous peoples' inherent and treaty rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019302">The government's commitment to renewed relationships means working to support indigenous capacity building and indigenous peoples' vision of self-determination, including in the areas of fisheries, oceans, aquatic habitat and marine waterways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019303">These supplementary estimates provide $171 million to three organizations to advance the government's reconciliation strategy. The first item is $132 million to Fisheries and Oceans Canada to implement agreements signed in August 2019 with Elsipogtog and Esgenoôpetitj first nations in New Brunswick and the Maliseet of Viger in Quebec to advance reconciliation of fisheries and to continue engaging with indigenous communities and stakeholders on fisheries policies. The 10-year interim fisheries implementation agreements reaffirm our shared commitment to advance the recognition and exercise of these first nations' fishing and harvesting rights, a meaningful step towards self-determination.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019304">These agreements were concluded in a spirit of collaboration and were built on the long and hard work of first nations to ensure that all members of the communities have job opportunities in the fishery.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019305">The second item is $37 million to Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs to implement the Haíɫcístut Incremental House Post Agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019306">In July I signed this reconciliation agreement with Heiltsuk Chief Marilyn Slett in Bella Bella on British Columbia's central coast. The reconciliation agreement addresses the priorities that are the most important to Heiltsuk self-government, housing and infrastructure, economic development, and language revitalization and preservation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019307">I was interested to learn that Haíɫcístut is a Heiltsuk word that means to turn something around and make it right again. It is the perfect word for this reconciliation agreement. The road that Canada and the Heiltsuk nation have travelled has not always been easy. Canada put up many roadblocks along the way. What is changed is that now Canada is listening and we are taking our lead from the first nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019308">The third item is $2 million to Parks Canada to support the negotiation of three components of the rights and reconciliation agreement with the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Wolastoqey and Peskotomuhkati, or Passamaquoddy, first nations: the stewardship of cultural and natural resources, the co-management of areas of mutual interest and the pursuit of a moderate livelihood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019309">At Parks Canada, natural and cultural heritage places established before 1982, the removal of indigenous peoples from traditionally used lands and the cessation of harvesting and cultural practices have resulted in profound cultural, spiritual and economic impact to individuals and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019310">The rights reconciliation agreements would include elements of harvesting and resource conservation and support capacity-building initiatives for the management of cultural resources. These resources support changes to existing monitoring resource conservation and planning processes, and the move towards the co-operative management of ecological and cultural resources.</ParaText>

Instead, it put up barriers to true partnership with indigenous people and look where it has gotten us. We have to make the relationship right again. We need to embody the Haíɫcístut, a word of the Heiltsuk peoples which means to turn things around and make things right again, for all first nations, Métis, Inuit and indeed a better future for all Canadians. This will only happen if we accelerate the process to self-determination and self-government for all indigenous peoples based on how they want to define and govern themselves and how they want the relationship with the Crown to be.</ParaText>

We have had processes where the continuing students have had first dibs, and then the high school leavers. However, we all know we have to do more because it is sometimes the young moms who want to go back to school to become social workers or nurses. We know we have to do better at this.</ParaText>

We know that is a key to success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019321">We also worry about people leaving high school. In some of the schools there are graduation coaches or consultants where, if they start by assuming every child will finish high school, they can actually turn around what had been the expectation previously. We are also hearing from the leaders that on-the-land and immersion programming, which may be in the summer, are ways that we can make first nations, Inuit and Métis students proud. That is the way we go forward as we build the role models and the other examples, so they can see themselves in these people who are now scientists and doctors and lawyers, but also guides on the land and all kinds of things as they walk in both worlds.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252487" Type="2">Mr. Serge Cormier (Acadie—Bathurst, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6019396">Madam Chair, I appreciate this opportunity to talk about an issue of great importance to all MPs and to all Canadians: the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence. I would like to thank the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces for the excellent work they do every day for this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019397">Today I would like to talk about how our government is taking care of Canadian Armed Forces members and their families. As I said before, the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families are a priority for our government. Our people in uniform are the forces' most valuable asset. Our troops keep Canada safe and contribute to multilateral efforts to make the world safer, more prosperous and more sustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019398">We can have the most modern equipment in the world, work in the greenest facilities, offer the best possible services and have the best possible policies, but none of that matters as much as taking good care of our women and men in uniform. That is why our government and the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> built Canada's defence policy around our people, our troops, our civilian employees and our military families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019399">Our “Strong, Secure, Engaged” defence policy guarantees that the Canadian Armed Forces will employ more people, that they will be properly prepared to tackle the task at hand and to encourage them to stay on once they have enlisted. In addition, giving our military personnel our full support guarantees that they will have the tools needed to answer the call of duty anytime and anywhere to the best of their ability, so that they may continue to properly defend our country and preserve our values, helping keep Canadians safe. That is why our government promptly introduced initiatives to improve the care provided to our military personnel and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019400">I would like to outline some of those initiatives. Let me begin with those intended for military family members, since they are the strength behind the uniform. Military family members provide ongoing support and step up when their loved ones have be elsewhere. We recognize the immense contribution they make and we are extremely grateful to them for that. That is why the defence team updated the military family services program. We are providing an additional $6 million a year to military family resource centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019401">Through the seamless Canada initiative, we are working with the provinces and territories to facilitate relocation. We also put in place virtual mental health consultation services for the families and deployed support staff abroad to support soldiers anywhere, at any time. We also launched the military spousal employment network to give military spouses access to jobs offered by employers across the country in the public or private sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019402">Another aspect is transition support. Sometimes, as we know, military families continue to deal with some unique challenges when they leave the forces. That is why our commitment to their well-being goes beyond their years of active service. A year ago, we officially established the Canadian Armed Forces transition group. This group, as promised in our policy, provides support to sick and injured members of the Canadian Forces and facilitates the transition for all members, veterans and their families. This is an important first step in improving the care provided to our troops when they transition to a new post or life outside the forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019403">A third very important aspect is compensation and benefits. To ensure that members of the Canadian Armed Forces feel supported throughout their career, the government is also ensuring that they receive adequate compensation. We have launched several initiatives to ensure that our military members are well compensated. For example, we have enhanced tax breaks for members who participate in international missions. We have also altered the compensation structure for the reserves so that reservists are paid the same as members of the regular forces for equal work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019404">A very important issue that we are also tackling is changing the culture of the defence team. We are doing nothing less than changing the way in which we support our troops and their families. Just as important is the fact that we are focusing on changing the culture within the Canadian Armed Forces. That is why we are striving to implement the recommendations concerning the equal treatment of the sexes in all of our programs and policies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="00">(2100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6019405"> According to “Strong, Secure, Engaged: Canada's Defence Policy”, diversity and inclusion must be prioritized for effective operations and decision-making in the Canadian Armed Forces. We know that diverse and inclusive armed forces are more agile and more effective. This is why we are committed to increasing the proportion of women in the Canadian Armed Forces to 25% by 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019406">We know that the Canadian Armed Forces have not always been welcoming to members from all backgrounds, in particular to LGBTQ2 and visible minority members. We are committed to correcting these mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019407"> In November 2017, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> formally apologized to Canadians who had endured discrimination based on their sexual orientation. It never should have happened, and we are committed to eradicating intolerance within the Canadian Armed Forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019408">We are currently working with other government partners to follow through on the results of the class action lawsuit over the LGBT purge. Up to $110 million will be set aside to compensate all those who were subjected to these discriminatory practices, including federal public servants, members of the Canadian Armed Forces and members of the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019409">We have also implemented reconciliation and commemoration measures. There is the Canada pride citation, which will be awarded to eligible applicants in recognition of their service to Canada and the hardships they endured. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019410">We have learned from the past. Our government will continue to make every effort to ensure that the workplace is welcoming and free from harassment and discrimination. Hateful behaviour, in any form, will not be tolerated. Furthermore, tougher sentences for crimes motivated by prejudice or hate were proposed in our Bill <Document DbId="9847536" Type="3">C-77</Document>, which received Royal Assent this summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019411">This was a defining moment for the military justice system, giving more rights to victims of service offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019412">We will also continue to move forward with Operation Honour, the mission of which is to eliminate sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019413">Two weeks ago, the Federal Court approved a $900-million settlement agreement in the class action lawsuit over sexual misconduct in the CAF and DND. We hope this settlement will serve as recognition of the harm done to victims of sexual misconduct and enable them to turn the page and begin the healing process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019414">We are proud of the care we provide to members of our Canadian Armed Forces. From the time they first don the uniform to the day they hang it up for good and beyond, we will be there for them and their families. They deserve to be taken care of, and they deserve to be respected. Our government will make sure it does both.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019415">Once again, I commend the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces for the work they do for us every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019416">In my speech I talked about the services we are offering to families. The minister and I had an opportunity to visit the base in Gagetown when I was the parliamentary secretary. I would like to ask him a question about family resource centres and the transition that some men and women have to make when moving from one base to another. </ParaText>

The infrastructure that they use did not get the appropriate investments in the past. One of the things our government is doing is reversing that. A $250-million investment into reserve infrastructure over the next five years allows us to provide the direct support when it comes to immediate maintenance work that needs to be done. We are taking a long-term approach as well. In our defence policy, reserves are going to be needed more in domestic operations. Therefore, as we do the analysis, we are going to make sure that we take a long-term approach and make the appropriate investments in the various regions where it is needed most.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019438">Before I talk in-depth about the issues, I first want to speak more generally about the supplementary estimates. There are things missing there that should normally be included. First, there is the compensation for our supply managed farmers. We have been talking about it for several months. A few days before a byelection, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went to Lac-Saint-Jean to tell our farmers that he would not open breaches in supply management. A few weeks after the election, we learned that more concessions would be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019439">In fact, every international trade agreement, whether we are talking about the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, or the new NAFTA, included breaches in supply management. For a government that claims to protect supply management, this is not a strong showing. Compensation has always been promised, but it is still difficult to obtain. We were told it was in the budget, but there was no funding. Now, we are being told that the money will be here by the end of the year, but when we look at the votes, we see that there is still no money for supply-managed producers. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019444">I have another question. This one is about health transfers. We want to see new money. The budget includes about $100 million in additional funding for Health Canada. That extra money could go to the provinces. We actually need billions, but that would be a start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019445">This government is always trying to come up with new federal programs. Today, it is health care, but we could be talking about any other federal program or initiative. These initiatives always sound great, but the problem is that they do not mesh well with the programs we have in Quebec. Quebec has exclusive jurisdiction over health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019446">The problem is that federal transfers do not keep up with inflation. The Government of Quebec's costs go up by 5% or 6% every year, but the federal government refuses to boost transfers by more than 1% or 2% per year. Sometimes it goes as high as 3%, but there is always a deficit. The upshot is that we are losing money. Health care is costing us more each year because the federal government is not paying its share.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019450">Furthermore, during the election campaign, we promised to invest an additional $6 billion in health transfers to help all of the provinces, including Quebec, invest in the crucial health care services needed by everyone, especially seniors in Quebec and across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019453">Next, still on the subject of new spending, of the $4.9 billion requested, approximately $427 million were requested by the Department of National Defence and just over $355 million by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. That is close to a billion dollars in new money for those two departments. It just so happens that the same departments in Quebec had major demands.

The Canadian government had essentially severed ties with the Davie shipyard. We invested in a supply ship, two ferries that are soon to be built, and three icebreakers, the first ones the Canadian government has acquired since 1993. We also invested in rehabilitating, renovating and updating 12 frigates. The Davie shipyard will be doing some of that work over the next 20 years. This is the biggest contract the Canadian government has ever awarded to the Davie shipyard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019456">There is still a lot to do, but we are very proud of the Davie shipyard workers. We will keep working very hard with them to make sure they have the opportunity to meet the Canadian government's substantial shipbuilding and investment needs.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6019483">Madam Chair, as this is the first time I am formally addressing the House, I would like to thank the residents of Davenport for placing their trust in me once again and electing me for the second time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019484">I am pleased to rise in the House this evening to speak about the ways National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces are partnering with Canadians to enhance our national security. Together they are developing innovative tools and strategies and facilitating economic opportunity, while ensuring that our military can remain agile and adapt to a constantly changing and often unpredictable security environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019485">It is no secret that Canada is facing threats in new and emerging domains. Global instability is heightened by the effects of climate change and scarcity, while rapid advances in technologies bring both opportunity and risk. Unlike the Conservatives, who cut billions of dollars in defence spending and mismanaged procurement projects, our defence policy, entitled “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, invests in our women and men in uniform and looks to tackle the challenges that a modern world faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019486"> Canada is looking at historically non-military threats through a military lens. Let us take cyber-domain as an example. As cyber-technologies continue to become a part of our everyday lives, Canada's responses must become increasingly nimble and nuanced to ensure we meet the new challenges they create. As a result of these and other emerging factors, National Defence is increasingly looking beyond the traditional defence and security sphere for input and for solutions, a whole-of-Canada approach to conducting defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019487">Two years ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> committed that the Department of National Defence would strengthen our relationship with the academic and expert community. We are doing exactly that through our new mobilizing insights in defence and security program, also known as MINDS. This program allows National Defence to reach out and mobilize the defence and security academic and expert community across Canada to gain expert insight on global security policy and to generate knowledge in the public policy realm. These measures also allow us to better anticipate and understand threats, opportunities and challenges that Canada will face. The MINDS program has recently launched three collaborative networks, bringing together multidisciplinary experts to address key defence and security challenges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019488">The department is reaching out even further with the innovation for defence excellence and security program, also known as IDEaS. Through this program, National Defence is supporting defence innovation across Canada, because we know that the federal government does not have a monopoly on good ideas. That is why, through IDEaS, we are reaching out to Canadian companies and innovators so they can put forward their best solutions to help us solve defence and security challenges. The IDEaS program was launched in April 2018 and, through it, challenges have been posted for the Canadian innovation community. The various elements of IDEaS include competitive projects, contests, innovation networks, sandboxes and innovation assessment and implementation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019489">Being able to adapt quickly to changing threats is one of the main goals of National Defence. This program will help bring forward the best ideas in each of these areas to help better support our women and men in uniform. It does not matter if someone is working from home, in a university lab or in a small company or large corporation; everyone is invited to participate in the IDEaS program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019490">The department has launched five calls for proposals under competitive projects, encompassing a total of 40 separate challenges. These calls for proposals cover a variety of existing and emerging defence and security challenges, from supporting Canadian Armed Forces members' physical and mental well-being, to enhancing Canada's cybersecurity, to finding ways to green defence, to all other ways the Canadian Armed Forces can be more nimble, more effective, more sustainable and more responsive to Canada's defence needs in the 21st century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019491">IDEaS also presents opportunities for innovators to field-test their projects in a realistic setting. This happened earlier this year at CFB Suffield, where participants had the opportunity to test their prototype solutions for detecting and countering micro- and mini-unmanned aerial systems in a real-world setting.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6019492">Finally, through IDEaS, the department is also running a variety of independent contests like the Pop-Up City challenge. Through this challenge, competitors are working with the Department of National Defence to develop improved energy, water, and waste management solutions through relocatable temporary camps that the military could one day use domestically or on deployments around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019493">Although these challenges are centred on defence, we know that innovation sparks further innovation. Canadian innovators are encouraged to workshop their ideas in a defence setting, but their work could also have applications across many other domains, just as the camera in our smart phones was originally designed to be small enough to sit on a spacecraft while still producing imagery of scientific quality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019494">Taken together, the IDEaS and MINDS programs demonstrate National Defence's dedication to inspiring innovation and to learning from new perspectives on defence and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019495">We are also focused on ensuring that the Canadian Armed Forces receives the capabilities it needs now and in the future, one that takes into account our diversity. That is why our defence team completes a gender-based analysis plus as part of all defence team activities, making sure that our policies and our equipment support those who serve, no matter what their gender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019496">At the same time, when we invest in our capabilities, it helps build up the Canadian economy, creating well-paying middle class jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019497">As members can see, National Defence is working hard to provide the Canadian Armed Forces with the capabilities they need to stay agile and effective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019498">While the Conservatives spent a decade underinvesting in our Royal Canadian Air Force, our government is stepping up to ensure that we can meet our NORAD and NATO commitments at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019499">National Defence is making progress on the competition for Canada's future fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force, the largest investment in the Royal Canadian Air Force in over 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019500">By investing in 88 future fighters, Canada will have the advanced capabilities it needs to remain a dedicated international partner around the world. Through this process, National Defence will work with suppliers and other stakeholders to support industrial and technological growth across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019501">In the meantime, National Defence is exploring ways to extend the lifespan of our CF-18 fighters until this procurement is complete. Phase one of the Hornet extension project is already under way. It will deliver enhancements designed to meet international regulatory requirements and improve interoperability. In the coming years, this project will also deliver key improvements to the CF-18's combat capabilities by enhancing sensors, weapons, survivability, and mission support systems. Throughout this project, in-service support will be conducted through existing contracts with Canadian industry, creating additional opportunities for the people who build and maintain Canada's fighter jets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019502">Likewise, the department is continuing to make progress on the new Canadian surface combatant for the Royal Canadian Navy. Construction is scheduled to begin in the early 2020s. These warships will provide improved combat power at sea and facilitate missions such as counterpiracy, counterterrorism, humanitarian aid and search and rescue. They have started work on the armoured combat support vehicle project. This means they can begin to replace Canada's current fleet of LAV II Bison and M113 tracked LAV fleets as early as 2021, ultimately saving money that would otherwise be spent maintaining an aging fleet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019503">Because the combat support vehicles are being built here in Canada, this project is estimated to support over 10,000 jobs across the country. That is intentional. National Defence's capital projects have a significant impact on Canada's economy, providing jobs and opportunities across different industries. We see that in projects like the Arctic and offshore patrol ships as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019504">Last month, the minister was able to visit the future HMCS <I>Harry DeWolf</I> just as it began the builder's sea trials, a major milestone. As a result of the hard work of shipbuilders and suppliers across the country, these will be the first Canadian-made ships in 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019505">There is also the fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft replacement project. We expect this plane to arrive in Comox this spring, enhancing the Canadian Armed Forces' vital search and rescue capabilities, including in Canada's north. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019506">These projects demonstrate the ways that National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces are driving innovation and creating jobs for Canadians, ensuring Canada remains a valued international partner while also supporting Canada's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019507">Whether we are talking about programs like IDEaS and MINDS or some of the largest procurement projects in the department's history, National Defence is making sure our military is ready for tomorrow's challenges, challenges that increasingly operate beyond a military context.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019518">Madam Chair, our Rangers are a gem within the Canadian Armed Forces. They provide a tremendous capability for us that is sought after by even some of our allies. Supporting them is about supporting our communities in the north, and having that knowledge base is extremely important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019519">That is why we are modernizing their equipment. New rifles are starting to arrive and they are being trained on them. We are investing $32.8 million in delivering state-of-the-art equipment for them.

That provides a lot of flexibility for the families who are left behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019524">We have had a significant footprint since we formed government.

              <ParaText id="6019607">Canada is the second-largest country on earth. In order for Canadians to travel across the country and go to foreign destinations, because we are a trading nation, which requires us to visit other countries, our airports play an absolutely essential role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019608">The statistics indicate that flying is continuing to increase in our country, so we have to have airports that are safe, secure, efficient and well served by the different airlines. That can sometimes be a bit of a challenge. Canadians would like to be able to go to their local airport and sometimes go to destinations that are not possible to go to directly. Those are obviously some of the things we have to deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019609">Some people have said that when they go to airports it takes too long to go through security. That is another area we are trying to address: the challenge of making it a smoother experience. There are still things we need to do to improve that situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019610">Sometimes we would like our airports to be transportation hubs so when people come out of the airport, particularly in large cities, they can access other modes of transportation to get downtown and the like. </ParaText>

We had a presentation of the C-295 aircraft, which is fantastic. I raise it because the minister is a leader on this. I like the line that he used in his report: strong, secure and engaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019615">Through this government, the minister recognized the many different deficiencies of the Harper government. He said that we needed to be more long-term in our thinking and we needed to ensure we were moving forward on many different fronts when it came to our Canadian Forces. He recognized that we needed to be there in that very real and tangible way, and the report highlights that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019616">My question for the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is twofold. First, could he provide some of his thoughts in regard to that report? Also, I was really impressed with the C-295. I had the opportunity to go in one, take a look at its radars, its ability to magnify and see things from 30,000 feet in the air. The details they could see were amazing. They had infrared. It was very impressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019617">I am not too sure what the actual deal was or how many we would acquire, but it was a positive step in providing our women and men of the Canadian Forces a state-of-the-art search and rescue aircraft. I believe all Canadians will benefit by this, because it is not only for military benefit; it is also for civilian benefit. I may be a bit biased because, after all, I served in Edmonton, but we can now provide second to no other search and rescue in the world.</ParaText>

It just goes to show the tremendous work that our search and rescue technicians do on a daily basis.

              <ParaText id="6019620">The fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft is going to revolutionize how we do search and rescue. No longer is it going to be strictly by looking out the aircraft with binoculars. We are using the same type of technology we use when it comes to dealing with adversaries. We are using that technology to locate hikers who are missing or downed aircraft. One thing I am particularly impressed with is what members will be able to do with this type of technology. It will save a lot more lives. It just goes to show that when we give the right tools to our Canadian Armed Forces members, they will do wonders for us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019623">In the last 30 or 40 years and beyond, we have been moving in the direction of doing some wonderful things by working with indigenous leaders. One of the issues that has come to the table in the last number of years is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report and its 94 calls for action. I do not know if the minister is aware of it, but I know there were a number of direct responses to those calls for action. When we talk about those 94 calls for action, we are not saying that every one of them is of a federal or national nature, but a number of them are. The minister and I talked about this a little earlier. Language was part of it, and foster care and the issue of citizenship and the taking of the oath. In many ways, the government has made the Truth and Reconciliation report a very high priority when talking about establishing a sense of respect and having the dialogue necessary for us to move forward on a such a critically important issue.</ParaText>

We have the other road map in the calls for justice from the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls commission, but our commitment to put the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into legislation is very important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019626">As the member has identified, the very important bill that former member of Parliament Romeo Saganash tabled was debated and eventually passed in the House. Unfortunately, it did not make it through the other place.

              <ParaText id="6019637">Madam Chair, I will go as fast as I can, but since I am standing for the first time speaking in the House, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of North Island—Powell River for allowing me to be here representing them. I want to take a moment to recognize the many forestry workers who are on strike right now in my riding, and struggling every day. My heart is with them and their families as they go through this very difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019638">My questions are largely for the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>. I am so grateful that he is here today. I am so proud to represent 19 Wing Comox. Recently, Habitat for Humanity Vancouver Island North did a key ceremony and gave keys to several houses that were built in the Comox Valley. There are many volunteers from 19 Wing who have been donating a significant amount of time to support building these houses and I appreciate their hard work. Their commitment is the 19 Wing building our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019639">However, the other reality is that in Comox Valley, the rental vacancy rate is below 1%, and the housing costs are increasing, skyrocketing in fact. Many people from the wing are struggling to find appropriate housing. I know some of our members are having to drive over an hour one way to get to work every day, which is definitely a challenge for them and their families. We also know that many of the barracks were built in the 1950s and need a significant upgrade to become more appropriate for the men and women in uniform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019640">The other reality is we have the addition of the search and rescue training facility. I am very proud of the work that we were able to do collaboratively with the community and with the <Affiliation DbId="214311" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to make that a reality. That resulted in a small increase of housing for the folks who are coming to get the training. It is not meeting that core housing need for so many of our members who need permanent housing on the base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6019641">Could the minister update this place on any resources that might be coming to 19 Wing to address this important core housing need?</ParaText>

We have made significant investments on bases when it comes to the new capabilities that we are bringing in. Housing is a challenge in the area because there is a very low vacancy rate. Therefore, we are prioritizing this work. When I visited, I looked at this issue directly. I do not want to get ahead of myself to say that this is exactly what we are going to do, but one thing I can assure you is that I am personally looking into this, to make sure that housing is looked after.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019646">Madam Chair, as we all know, there is a housing shortage and the cost of housing is high. However, in reality, that is not the only high expense that military members are facing in my riding. It is an expensive place to live. One military member has told me that people who move to British Columbia must remember to bring cash, which adds a certain barrier.</ParaText>

It is really important to our members to acknowledge this financial burden and give them support to do the important work they do. I want to recognize that many of the military members in my riding went to Mali and continue to do great work in my riding and across the world. I want to make sure they do not get set behind because of the important work they are doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6019650">Madam Chair, one of the realities that I believe everybody in the House agrees with is that losing someone to suicide is a devastating experience. I am still very concerned about the fact that self-harm is still included in the military Code of Service Discipline. I know this prevents our men and women in uniform from feeling comfortable disclosing that they may be having a hard time and are considering suicide as an option. I just want to make sure that all the men and women who serve us and wear the uniform in this country feel they can disclose any thoughts, concerns or feelings they have, especially on the issue of self-harm.</ParaText>
