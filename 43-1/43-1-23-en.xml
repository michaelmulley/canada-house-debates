              <ParaText id="6059439"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to rise in the House this morning to introduce the safe and regulated sports betting act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059440">I have gotten great support from across the House. I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="252973" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> in particular for his assistance with this legislation and for the seconding of the bill here this morning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059441">There are others in our caucus who have given great support, such as the members for <Affiliation DbId="252896" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="253017" Type="2">Niagara Falls</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="252805" Type="2">Calgary Shepard</Affiliation>, and I would like to thank them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059442">This is a historic moment. This is the third time this bill has come to the House. As members know, it passed in 2015 but got stopped in the Senate. Last time, in the 42nd Parliament, it did not make it out. This is third time lucky, as we will join forces with everyone in the House to see if we can move this bill forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059443">Let me be clear that single-event sport wagering already exists in this country, and if members do not think so, they are behind the curtains. The Canadian single-event sport wagering industry is worth over $14 billion, but most of it, 95% of it, exists underground on the black market or through offshore websites. These are unregulated sport-wagering sites. None of that activity is subject to government regulations or taxes; none of it is creating jobs in this country or economic opportunities; and none of it is contributing to consumer protection, education, harm reduction initiatives or support services, which are badly needed in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059444">This legislation would amend the Criminal Code to repeal the federal ban on single-event sport betting and allow the provinces to implement a safe and regulated betting environment within the provincial wagering and lottery systems. By passing this bill, we can put a stop to the billions of dollars going to organized crime and put that money back into our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059445">To wrap up, it has all changed since 2018. The United States has allowed it. Sports leagues, like the NHL and NBA, are in favour of sports betting being regulated. It is time this country follows forward. I will have more to say on this bill, but it gives me great pleasure to stand in the House this morning and introduce it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059450">This bill was introduced in the previous Parliament as Bill <Document DbId="10260418" Type="4">C-424</Document>. It is designed to better protect young people and persons living with disabilities from sexual exploitation. This is a direct result of the advocacy, comments and concerns of the people of Perth—Wellington. They were shocked in January 2018 to learn that a person who was employed to work with young people and persons living with disabilities was convicted of a serious sexual crime against a person living with a disability. As a sentence, he received a monetary fine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059451">This bill would ensure appropriate sentencing for anyone who commits a serious sexual crime against a young person or a person living with disabilities. It provides for guidance in sentencing if the crime is committed against a young person or a person living with disabilities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059454"> He said: Mr. Speaker, almost seven years ago to the day I stood in the Alberta legislature to begin a journey to change compassionate care leave in this country. This legislation successfully passed, allowing thousands of Alberta caregivers to take time off work to care for their gravely ill loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059455">Today, I am rising in this chamber to introduce my bill, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (compassionate care leave). This legislation, if passed, would allow caregivers using the compassionate care leave program to take additional time off work following the death of their loved one. Currently, this leave ends immediately following a loved one's death, not leaving enough time for the caregiver to make the practical necessities like funeral arrangements and estate planning and to have the time to grieve. My bill would extend compassionate care leave so that caregivers can take up to three extra weeks off work following their loved one's death. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059456">This is job-protected leave, so caregivers would not have to worry about losing their employment during this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059457">Caregiving is exhausting work. I hope members on all sides of the House will see the need for this amendment to the Canada Labour Code and support the continued progress of compassionate care leave in our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059459">She said: Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the environmental restoration incentive act. I thank many members and colleagues for their support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059460">Canadian energy producers lead the world in remediation and reclamation, but struggling small and medium-sized oil and gas producers are collapsing in real time, leaving fiscal and environmental liabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059461">The 2019 Redwater decision means at-risk small companies now cannot raise money for that purpose. Municipalities lose major revenue and facilities are left in different conditions. It is not evasion or neglect by small gas producers, but a stark reality of their precarious economic positions. The number of orphan wells rose more than 300% since 2015. There are more than 130,000 inactive wells in Canada. Cleanup costs are estimated between $30 billion and $70 billion. The current orphan well system is overwhelmed and risks costing taxpayers 100% of those costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059462">My bill would enable small producers to raise money from investors exclusively for decommissioning oil and gas wells. It would incentivize and ensure private sector proponents can fulfill environmental responsibilities at the lowest public cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059463">My bill is not a perfect remedy for this complex challenge that requires co-operation and ongoing action from federal and provincial governments. I ask all members to partner and prioritize real solutions for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059464">We can make a real difference right away with a tax credit that can only be used the year a well is decommissioned, will only exist for six years, and will only be for small and medium-sized producers that need it the most, with further measures later on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059465">My bill would help the environment, create immediate jobs for oil and gas workers, and protect taxpayers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059467">She said: Mr. Speaker, there has been a disturbing trend in Canada toward what is referred to as regulatory or constructive taking of private property. This happens when government uses its statutory powers to regulate or restrict the property rights of an owner without acquiring title to the land being adversely affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059468"> The landowner feels the impact of the regulation as if the land had been expropriated. In Canada, government acquisition of land without owner's consent is not subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Landowners' rights are found in expropriation legislation. The government must follow the law as to what land may be expropriated and must observe the procedures set out in legislation. By setting out exceptions in the Expropriation Act, my bill seeks to remove some uncertainty from the existing legislation as to whether owners can be compensated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059469">With this legislation, my goal is to protect the private property rights of average Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059477">Tax season is approaching, and citizens and businesses in Quebec will have to file two income tax returns, with two different types of statements, two types of net income and two types of schedules. Everything needs to be done twice. Is it possible to simplify the lives of citizens and businesses by having them file a single income tax return? That is what we are proposing. It would be administered by Quebec, since Revenu Québec is present in every region and already manages the collection of GST and QST. Quebec finance minister Yves Séguin, a Liberal, was the one who first proposed this approach, which now has the support of every member of every party in the Quebec National Assembly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059478">This law would also enable Quebec to fight more effectively against the use of tax havens, since Ottawa is dragging its feet in that regard. We want to ensure we can protect and maintain all regional jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059479">We believe it is entirely possible to secure those jobs by reclassifying the public servants and putting them in other jobs that are currently understaffed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059480">The Research Institute on Self-Determination of Peoples and National Independence conducted a study. A single income tax return would save $425 million for individuals, businesses and the public administration. Can we stop making citizens, businesses and the public administration do everything twice? I am confident that we can. </ParaText>

We have the ability to regulate matters pertaining to the environment and the development of our territory. It is inconceivable to me that Quebec should have to defer to the federal government on these matters, because what happens within our borders should be decided by us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059505">Mr. Speaker, I am requesting an emergency debate on the economic impact on all of Canada caused by the cancellation of Teck Frontier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059506">It is an economic crisis for Canada, because energy is the biggest private sector investor in the economy and creates jobs in every province. However, nearly $200 billion in oil and gas projects have been cancelled or stalled, and 200,000 Canadian oil and gas workers have lost their jobs in the last five years. Every oil sands job creates five other indirect and induced jobs in other sectors in other provinces. Canada has the third-largest oil reserves in the world; 97.3% of which is in the oil sands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059507">Teck's cancellation is the 11th major multi-billion-dollar oil and gas project to be withdrawn, and Teck is the latest in a list of 18 companies that have cancelled or frozen their Canadian energy assets in the same time frame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059508"> This flight of capital from Canada's energy sector represents a bigger loss of investment and jobs than at any comparable time frame in more than seven decades. It is the equivalent of losing both the automotive and aerospace sectors in Canada, which I am confident would rightly be considered a national economic catastrophe and a severe crisis by every member of every party in this House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059509"> The cancellation of Teck Frontier will cost Alberta 10,000 badly needed jobs and $20 billion in investment. It will cost 14 indigenous communities, all locally impacted and all supportive, their agreements with financial, education and skills training opportunities. It will eliminate the potential of $70 billion in revenue to all levels of government, municipal, provincial and federal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059510"> Its cancellation represents a crisis of investor confidence in the fairness, predictability, independence, and certainty of Canada's regulatory system, policy framework, and the economy overall. Teck invested $1 billion while meeting every requirement during eight years of a rigorous multi-jurisdictional review, and even recently took the unprecedented step of self-imposing a goal to be net zero by 2050, far beyond the already world-leading standards of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059511">Seven months ago, Teck Frontier was recommended by the independent expert joint panel to be in the public interest of Canada, based on its science, evidence, technical, environmental and economic merits, but within a week of the final political decision, media reported that Teck board members concluded that public safety concerns and political risk in Canada made it impossible to continue to pursue the Frontier project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059512"> Already this week, economists and commentators are wondering and warning whether any major energy projects can be proposed or built in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059513"> A painful truth is that it also represents an escalating national unity crisis from the perspective of western Canadians, who see political double standards for oil and gas compared to other sectors and other provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059514"> All these factors combined present a national emergency that ought to seize the attention of every member of the House of Commons. An emergency debate is the bare minimum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059515"> Previously, emergency debates were granted when Kinder Morgan announced its withdrawal from the Trans Mountain expansion and when General Motors announced the closure of their automobile assembly plant in Oshawa. Every member here agreed those were emergencies that deserved debate in Parliament, and it happens to be the case that Teck Frontier is larger, both in investment and in jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059516"> For these reasons I request again, and thank you in advance for, your consideration for this important emergency debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059524">I must say at the outset that Canadians already support this policy.

At the same time, other countries like the United Kingdom and the European Union have 100% dental coverage. Basic dental care is covered in those countries. Six million Canadians, when we put aside young people who have the opportunity to access provincial plans, are impacted by this lack of dental coverage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059527"> Jonathan works at minimum wage and cannot afford to get the basic cleaning that he needs as part of basic dental care. That means that because of bacteria in his mouth, he is often in pain. He tried to save up enough money to access the basic dental care that he needed, but then his car broke down. He needed it for work, so he had to make the tough choice between having transportation or getting his basic dental needs met. He simply could not do both. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059528">He has tried borrowing money, but that has not worked either, because it puts him in a debt cycle that he simply cannot afford. He has looked into dental plans, as his family has, but they found that the cost was simply prohibitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059529">In this country, half of Canadian families are $200 away from insolvency in any given month. Jonathan and his family are among them. A difference of $100 or $200 a month means the difference between managing to put food on the table, managing to keep a roof over their heads, and managing to pay the bills without going too much further in debt. They simply cannot afford the cost of a dental plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059530">Canadian families are the most indebted of any families in the industrialized world, and we have the highest family debt loads in our country's history right now. The reality of Jonathan is a reality that many other people face across the length and breadth of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059531">One thing I should mention about Jonathan is that in addition to the pain, in addition to the struggles of trying to find resources to pay for basic dental care, he also says that he feels ashamed of himself, that because of his broken teeth and because he is in such pain, he simply is not able to smile. The adoption of the motion today would mean that Jonathan, like six million other Canadians, would get their smile back. That is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059532">I would like to talk about Elsie. Elsie is not her real name. She did not want me to use her real name because she works for a big corporation that makes a lot of profit and has been held just shy of the number of hours needed to access the company's dental plan. She works in the food and hospitality sector. Her teeth are literally rotting away, but because there is no basic dental care, she is unable to access the dental care that she desperately needs.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059533">I will also talk about what I saw at the University of Montreal a few years ago. The dental clinic at the University of Montreal offers free dental care provided by students of the faculty of dental medicine who are studying to be dentists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059534">Fortunately, thanks to the University of Montreal, dental care is being provided, but there is a waiting list. People are lining up to get access and many of them are in pain because of the lack of basic dental care in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059535">That is the problem whether we are talking about Jonathan, Elsie or everyone else lining up to get care, not just at the University of Montreal, but all across the country. When there are free dental clinics, people are there because they are desperately trying to get badly needed dental care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059536">I recently had a meeting with working representatives from British Columbia, workers such as David Black, who is one of my bosses, a constituent of mine in New Westminster—Burnaby, as well as representatives from correctional workers, commercial workers and a teacher. They were all there in my office, and I mentioned that the NDP was bringing forward this motion. They said it was wonderful and that it could make a real difference in this country, and then they asked me what kind of dental plan members of Parliament had. I had to tell them that members of Parliament have granted themselves a good, effective dental plan that covers all of those basic needs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059537">Now those working people, who are here today, are saying through me to all members of Parliament that if dental coverage and dental plans are good enough for members of Parliament, they should be good enough for all Canadians across the length and breadth of this land.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059538">In terms of cost, people may be wondering how much this dental plan will cost. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has already informed us that it will cost $800 million a year. The cost will be higher the first year, of course, because there are needs that will have to be met, but it should come to about $800 million, or rather $814 million, the first year.<Query /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059539">If we take these amounts and compare them to the federal budget as a whole, we can see that they are not that high. Considering all the tax changes that the government wants to implement, this is something that would pay for itself.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059540">Why is that? It is because we already know from emergency room physicians across this country that tens of millions of dollars every year go into last-minute care that is provided in emergency rooms by doctors who are not qualified. People who are desperately seeking dental care go into emergency rooms, and they are given pills or painkillers to get them through the following few days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059541">Emergency room doctors tell us that we need to have basic dental care in this country and that the absence of basis dental care is costing our health care system over $150 million a year. We are already paying the costs of this emergency care, as well as the costs for all of the people like Jonathan and Elsie who cannot even go to work because of the pain they are experiencing. The six million Canadians who do not have dental care are an incredible charge on our economy and our quality of life, without even considering the impacts on each of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059542">Of course it makes sense to cap the tax changes and make sure we are taking care of basic dental care for all Canadians. This is a no-brainer. Members of Parliament need to get behind this idea. We need to make sure every Canadian has access to basic dental care in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059543">Madam Speaker, I would like to get clarification on the figures to make sure I am reading them right. On our tax bill, people who earn up to $210,000 get some relief, and everyone who makes less than $90,000 gets relief, as would be his case. I am assuming that people who earn less than $90,000 would get the same relief as in the proposed Liberal tax cut, and then the part that would be eliminated would be those over $210,000, because no one over that amount gets anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059544">If I am reading it right, how much money would be saved by taking the tax cut away from people who earn between $90,000 and $210,000?</ParaText>

The government has since revealed a very obvious thirst for centralization. Last year, the federal government intruded further and further into areas of provincial authority by exploiting its spending authority. What is being proposed here is a blatant intrusion into Quebec's jurisdiction. The Quebec government has always been against this idea, so much so that it called for the right to opt out with compensation. That element is missing from my colleague's motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059556">Madam Speaker, today we are talking about an opportunity to really transform the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059557"> My colleague told stories about some people, yet millions of Canadians cannot take care of their teeth. The Liberal government is proposing a tax giveaway, where the majority of the benefit would flow to those who earn over $100,000. If we target that measure and help those who need it most, those who earn less than $90,000, we can free up enough money to cover 4.3 million Canadians who need to take care of their teeth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059558"> That is what we are proposing today. It would transform the lives of people in the ridings of all members of Parliament who cannot get the dental care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059559"> I think about a woman who I met when I was walking down the streets of Vancouver. She ran up to me with her hand over her mouth. She told me that she had heard me talking about dental care. I told her that we wanted to ensure people were covered. She said that she never imagined she would ever be able to afford to get her teeth looked after. She told me that once she became older and was no longer covered under her parents' plan, she could not afford to go to the dentist, that her teeth were in a really rough shape now and that she was embarrassed. She was afraid to apply for a new job because she did not think people would hire her if they saw the condition of her teeth. She had tried her best, but there was something wrong with her teeth and she could not afford to get them looked fixed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059560">I think about her story and the many other Canadians who cannot afford to take care of their teeth. In a country as wealthy as ours, that should not be the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059561"> I think about what we could do if we made a better choice. We have choices. The Liberal government is making a choice. Right now, it is choosing to give away billions of dollars to people who do not need. It is making a choice to benefit those who do not really need the benefit. The Liberal government is making a choice and we are asking it to choose better. We could take the current proposal for the tax giveaway and put that money toward helping those who need it most. Let us focus on those people. If we do that, we would free up the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059562">Let us talk about the choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059563"> The Liberal government's proposed tax giveaway would cost over $6 billion. If it targeted that measure and focused it on those families that need it the most, we could free up $1.6 billion. The Parliamentary Budge Office costed out how much it would take to cover those families that are uninsured. It found that year over year, it would cost just over $800 million. It would be more expensive in the first year because so many Canadians who did not have access to dental care would rush to get their teeth fixed. That would cost $1.8 billion in the first year, but would stabilize at around $800 million. This is huge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059564">Imagine the people across Canada right now who cannot get their teeth taken care of. If they go to an emergency room because their teeth are hurting, they are told there is nothing the hospital can do. They are given painkillers and sent home, yet the problem with their teeth remains. If we think about it, it makes no sense that we can go into a hospital and have complicated heart surgery or have our joints rebuilt, but if we have a problem with our teeth, we are sent home with painkillers. That is the only solution so many Canadians have. We need to change that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059565">A couple of months ago a woman came to my office. She did not want me to share her name because she was embarrassed about her situation. She had a problem with her teeth. However, her problem was even more heartbreaking. She could not afford medication to treat an illness she had and due to the complications of that illness she had lost some of her teeth. She was in pain. This woman had two problems. First, she could not afford medication. Second, she could not afford dental care. When I looked at her, I thought of how we were failing as a society. She thought it was her fault. She told me that she wanted to work hard, that she did not want any handouts and that she was at my office because she wanted to find a way forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059567">Today we have an opportunity to make a change. The Liberal government is proposing a tax change, and we are proposing a solution.

              <ParaText id="6059568">We have been observing the Liberal government's decisions and choices.

              <ParaText id="6059569">We are proposing that this change be scaled down and targeted to the people who need it most, meaning people who earn less than $90,000. If we adopt this measure, we can implement a dental plan that will benefit nearly 4.3 million Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059570">We know that this is needed in Quebec. Some Quebeckers have dental problems but cannot afford dental care. We want to change that. A federal program would help these people access dental care, which would change many lives.</ParaText>

Giving Quebec the right to opt out with full compensation is part of our values. The measure we are proposing would use that money to help families who need it the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059589">Quebec could have access to the federal program if it wants. If it wants full compensation, that is also Quebec's prerogative. We are proposing something for the common good. We will always advocate for working together to build a more just society. We know we can achieve better results by working together. That is exactly what we are proposing, while still respecting Quebec's jurisdictions. Health is always a provincial responsibility. This is a matter of funding. We want to fund a program to help people who need dental care. That is exactly what we are talking about.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="253402" Type="96">Hon. Mona Fortier (Minister of Middle Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6059590">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to talk about our government's record, about how we have invested in Canadians, including middle-class Canadians and those working hard to join them, about the middle-class tax cuts we introduced in 2015, and about the tax cuts we proposed in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059591">The economy is strong and growing. Our record proves that, by investing in Canadians, we can have an impact on Canadians' day-to-day lives while growing the economy. However, we are also very aware that too many Canadians are still having trouble making ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059592">Ever since we took office in 2015, our plan has focused on investing in Canadians and their communities. We are investing in things people need to build a better future for themselves and their families. We are investing in the middle class and those working hard to join it. We know that a strong middle class leads to a strong economy, and a strong economy benefits everyone. Our plan is working.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059593">One of the first actions of our previous mandate was to introduce a tax break for the middle class that is benefiting more than nine million hard-working Canadians. We also introduced the Canada child benefit, which is providing more money to those families who need it most. By doing so, we have helped to lift one million people out of poverty, including 334,000 children, giving them a better start in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059594">I would like to talk about how this measure in particular has helped children in my riding. Ottawa—Vanier is one of Canada's most diverse ridings. In fact, I often say that it represents our nation's diversity in one riding. It has some of Canada's highest earners and some of Canada's lowest earners. That is why the Canada child benefit is so important to my constituents. Over 15,000 children in Ottawa—Vanier benefit from the Canada child benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059595">Our government has also increased the guaranteed income supplement to help low-income seniors make ends meet. By working in co-operation and collaboration with our provincial partners, we strengthened the Canada pension plan so that Canadian workers will have more money in retirement. I am sure that hon. members on all sides of the House will celebrate the fact that yesterday Statistics Canada released national poverty figures showing that 73,000 seniors have been lifted out of poverty since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059596"> Furthermore, our government understands that small businesses are the catalyst of our economy. That is why we cut taxes for small businesses to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses and create more good, well-paying jobs. This measure was well received, and small business owners responded. Canada has gained over one million jobs since 2015, most of which are full-time jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059597">I would also like to highlight our government's commitment to ensuring that everyone has a safe and secure place to call home. Our government established Canada's first national housing strategy. We have invested in the construction of more affordable housing in communities across the country and we have helped make it more affordable for people to buy their first home through enhancements to the first-time homebuyers incentive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059598">We have made tremendous progress by working with Canadians. We have listened to their requests so that we can grow an economy that works for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059599">Through our investments and Canadians' hard work, our country's economy is strong and growing. Over the past four years, Canadians have created over one million new jobs, and stronger wage growth has helped more people get ahead. However, we know that there is still a lot of work to be done.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059600">Over the past few months, leading up to budget 2020, I have met with Canadians and stakeholders in Montreal, Windsor, Regina, Winnipeg, Kenora and elsewhere to understand the needs of Canadians in different parts of this country. One thing that came up is that too many people are still worried about making ends meet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059601">The rising cost of living is affecting Canadians from coast to coast to coast. They know what it is like to have their livelihoods put at risk by global economic challenges, and they worry about what the future holds for them and their families. We understand that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059602">I heard from Canadians that a good quality of life for them means not having to worry about living paycheque to paycheque. It means being in good health. It means living in a safe environment and in a society where diversity is celebrated. It means access to quality housing, child care and education, and an opportunity for all to succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059603">We have made a lot of progress over the last four years to grow the economy while ensuring that the middle class prospers, but we know that there is much more to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059604">Economic growth and quality of life reinforce one another. We cannot sustain one for long without the other. We need to think about the future of our communities, about fighting climate change and protecting the environment, and about continuing our path to reconciliation with indigenous peoples. As long as these sorts of challenges are out there, our government will keep working to help Canadians overcome them. That is why making life more affordable for Canadians is a central focus for our government. It has been for the past four years and continues to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059605">We are looking to grow an economy that works for everyone, not just the rich. By investing in and strengthening the middle class, we are growing the economy to benefit everyone. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059606">Our plan to increase the basic personal amount will make the cost of living more affordable for more Canadians by helping them keep more of what they earn. That means they will have more money in their pockets. I would like to take a minute to explain how we will attain that objective and how that additional measure will benefit nearly 20 million Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059607">As my hon. colleagues know, to help all Canadians meet their basic needs, no federal tax is collected on a certain amount of income earned. That amount is called the basic personal amount, or BPA. Under the existing rules regarding the BPA, Canadians can earn close to $12,300 in the 2020 tax year before they have to pay federal income tax.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059608">As our first order of business our government proposed to lower taxes for the middle class and those working hard to join it by increasing the basic personal amount to $15,000 by 2023. We also propose to increase two related benefit amounts to $15,000 by 2023: the spouse or common-law partner amount and the eligible dependant credit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059609">This increase would be phased in over four years, starting in 2020. As I said earlier, it would cut taxes for close to 20 million Canadians. Importantly, it would mean that nearly 1.1 million more Canadians would no longer pay federal income tax at all by 2023. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059610">To ensure that this tax relief goes to the people who need help the most, we will phase out the benefits of the increased basic personal amount. I will explain what this means in real terms for individuals and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059611"> It means that a single individual who makes $50,000 a year would pay less tax starting in 2020 with tax savings of close to $300 in 2023. It means that a two-earner couple where one partner works full time at $40,000 a year and the other part time at $20,000 a year would save close to $600 by 2023. It means that a one-earner couple with one child could save close to $600 in 2023. It also means that a single parent who can claim the eligible dependant credit in addition to the basic personal amount could save close to $600 in 2023. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059612">All told, this would put $3 billion back in the pockets of Canadian households in 2020, with this amount rising to $6 billion by 2023. That is $6 billion to help make life more affordable for Canadians and keep our economy growing. That is $6 billion on top of the support that we have already delivered over the past four years.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059613">When the middle-class tax cut, the Canada child benefit and the proposed increases to the basic personal amount are taken into account, a typical family of four could have over $2,300 more in their pockets in 2020 than they did in 2015. Once the changes to the basic personal amount are fully implemented, that family could have over $2,800 more in their pockets than they did in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059614">That is what we mean when we talk about investing in Canadians. Thanks to the Canada child benefit, a working single mother or father of two earning $30,000 a year now gets $3,000 more in benefits every year than they did under the previous child benefit program. These changes will help more families pay for things that will have a real impact on their children's future, such as healthy food, registration fees for sports, summer camp or music lessons, or even warm clothes in the winter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059615">Our decision to improve the guaranteed income supplement has provided greater income security for close to 900,000 people, 70% of whom are women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059616">The guaranteed income supplement has helped lift 73,000 vulnerable seniors out of poverty. Thanks to the implementation of Canada's first-ever national housing strategy, a 10-year, $40-billion investment to provide more Canadians with affordable housing, the housing needs of 530,000 families will be met and chronic homelessness will decrease by 50%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059617">We will continue to invest in people and in the things that improve their quality of life. The past four years have shown what can happen when we put middle-class Canadians at the heart of our decisions and invest in those areas that make their lives easier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059618">We have seen that more money in families' pockets, more jobs, more welcoming communities and fewer people living in poverty contribute to our economic growth.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059619">I do not like to repeat myself, but I think it is important to highlight, in both English and French, the results of our government's work to make life more affordable for Canadians. Due to the middle-class tax cut, the Canada child benefit and the proposed changes to the basic personal amount, a typical family of four could be better off by more than $2,300 this year compared to 2015. When the proposed changes to the basic personal amount are fully rolled out, the family could be better off by more than $2,800 compared to 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059620">These changes have been focused on those Canadians who need it most. The effect our plan has had on child poverty and seniors in need has been clear and is documented. We know that more work needs to be done to improve the quality of life for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059621">The way we have structured these changes to the basic personal amount clearly shows we are striving to target our efforts to be as effective as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059622">The reason we have focused on housing and the tax system is the flexibility those changes offer to Canadians. By providing tax cuts for those who need it and by providing the Canada child benefit directly to parents and caregivers, we are giving Canadians the tools to make the changes they feel they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059623">We will also continue to work with indigenous peoples to help deliver a better quality of life for their families and communities. We will build on the progress achieved for all people in Canada, moving forward with investments that will make a real difference. We will do so in a way that is fiscally responsible and continues to reduce the federal debt relative to the size of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059624">Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio is low and sustainable. That puts Canada in an enviable position, especially compared to our G7 peers. Our relatively low level of debt gives us a serious competitive advantage, one our government is fully committed to maintaining. Even though our economy is doing well, we need to be ready to respond to whatever challenges might arise. We need to continue to build confidence in Canada's economy, making sure the world continues to see Canada as a great place in which to live, work and invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059625">Canada has a AAA credit rating from the three most recognized credit rating agencies. This strong rating reflects the confidence others have in Canada's economic strength. We took timely action during our previous mandate to improve business tax competitiveness in this country. To make it easier for small businesses to succeed and create more jobs, we have cut taxes for small businesses twice. As a result of federal and provincial actions, Canada has the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G7.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059626">Our government's objective is to maintain these competitive advantages while implementing measures to make life more affordable and to invest in Canadians. We are building an economy that works for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059627">We know what can happen when we invest in Canadians: They benefit through their hard work. In just four years, this has resulted in a strong and growing economy that has generated more than a million jobs with a historic low unemployment rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059628">These are real changes that help improve the quality of life and well-being of all Canadians. Making it easier for Canadians to get ahead is at the very heart of our plan for the prosperity of the middle class.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059658">Madam Speaker, I am happy to be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252830" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059659">I would like to thank my friends in the NDP for bringing this motion forward and giving us the opportunity to talk about the Liberal government's failed record when it comes to tax policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059660">As some members know, I enjoy listening to music, from bands like The Guess Who, who happen to hail from my hometown of Winnipeg, and The Beatles, and from artists like Jim Croce and Frank Sinatra, to name a few. When artists have been around long enough, they will usually release a greatest hits album. Today, I would like to produce a greatest hits album for the Liberal government. I think an appropriate title would be “the Liberals' greatest hits of failed tax policy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059661">Although this album was not supposed to be released yet, I will spend the next nine minutes or so giving my colleagues a sneak preview. The lead-off track on this album, which is one of my favourites, is called “the budget will balance itself”, written by the professor of peoplekind himself, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister of Canada</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059662">As a follow-up, he hiked up taxes on low-income families and then said they do not pay any taxes, seemingly unaware of the fact that they do. During a time of economic prosperity, the Liberals are running massive, endless deficits that will force even higher taxes on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059663">There are higher Canada pension plan premiums. They also eliminated the children's fitness tax credit and children's arts tax credit, making it harder for young families to afford these important programs. Despite the fact that their mantra has become “low carbon”, they axed the public transit tax credit, which means fewer people can afford transit passes. They are paying $600 million to the media, picking and choosing which media organizations are winners and which are losers, an Orwellian plan, to be sure, and one all Canadians should reject. It is no wonder half of Canadians say they are $200 away from insolvency each month. They are literally being taxed into bankruptcy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059664">Then there is the carbon tax, a massive tax grab that makes life more expensive for everyone and will not do anything to reduce emissions. In the last election, Canada's Conservatives put forward a real plan to protect the environment, including measures like the green home tax credit, which would have encouraged Canadians to make their homes more energy efficient. It would have incentivized green tech, making Canada a world leader. Since the Liberals came to power, 81% of middle-income Canadians are seeing higher taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059665">I am happy to note with respect to the environment that more Canadians voted for the Conservative Party of Canada's environmental plan than any other party. Our plan, unlike the Liberal plan, did not include an unfair carbon tax that penalizes Canadians for everyday activities. Especially given the winters we have in Manitoba, a carbon tax will do nothing other than penalize people who have to heat their homes when it is -30°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059666">There is some potential relief on the horizon. Yesterday, the Alberta Court of Appeal found the carbon tax to be unconstitutional. I hope the federal government listens to the Court of Appeal and respects its decision and its jurisdiction. Part of the majority 4-1 decision read as follows: “The Act is a constitutional Trojan horse.” That is strong language from the court. It continues, “Almost every aspect of the provinces' development and management of their natural resources...would be subject to federal regulation”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059667">The next hit on the hit list is “welfare for billionaires”. What a concept: We tax the poor to pay the rich. The Liberals are like a reverse Robin Hood. Robin Hood stole from the rich to give to the poor, and for some reason the Liberals have it backward. They tax the poor into bankruptcy and give the money to billionaires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059668">They gave $12 million to Loblaws to buy refrigerators. My guess is that Loblaws can afford to buy its own energy-efficient fridges. I checked, and as of 4 p.m. yesterday, Loblaws had a market cap of $25.2 billion. There was also the $40 million given to BlackBerry. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, BlackBerry had a market cap of $4.2 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059669">Then there is my favourite. I call it the $50-million trifecta. There was the $50-million handout to Mastercard. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Mastercard has a market cap of $322.8 billion. Also, $50 million went to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which repeatedly engages in funding anti-Semitic activities. There is also the $50 million that went to a late-night TV host, Trevor Noah, by tweet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059670">There is $50 million here, $50 million there, $50 million everywhere. I wonder who is next.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059671"> I know a few organizations that could use this money. Maybe if they ask the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> nicely, he will tweet yet another $50-million pledge. It is worth a try.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059672">Then there is the CRA. The government's motto should be “Pay us more; we'll treat you worse.” In the recently released “Serving Canadians Better” report, the CRA reported that 83% of Canadians had an experience that did not meet their needs. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business gave the CRA a grade of D, and 41% of those who called the CRA received incomplete or incorrect information, a sad state to be sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059673">Had it not been for the Conservative Party's pressuring the government from this side of the House, we would have had policies like reducing the accessibility to the disability tax credit for type 1 diabetics from 80% to 20%. Also, in October of 2017, the CRA tried to list employee discounts as taxable benefits, going after waiters and waitresses and restaurants for their employee discounts. In December of 2016, it came to light that the Liberals were considering taxing employer-provided health and dental plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059674">Let us talk about the small business tax changes. It was in the middle of the summer of 2017, when Canadians were enjoying the hot weather and spending time with their families, that the government decided to quietly table tax changes when it did not think anyone was paying attention. These changes would drastically alter the lives of thousands of small business owners and families. Yes, small business people who were part of the middle class or working hard to join it had the rug pulled out from under them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059675">The government tried to hike taxes by 73% on small business investment, made changes to the taxes on splitting income and passive income and refused to make intergenerational family business sales easier, making it more expensive to sell a business to a stranger than to a family member. Remember that hot weather I mentioned? While Canadians were enjoying a nice cold beer in the sun, what did the government do? It raised taxes on beer too. This is sacrilege. I cannot think of anything more Canadian than an ice cold beer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059676">More recently, the government proposed an interest deductibility cap for businesses. This would be a disaster for all businesses and would have serious marketplace repercussions for banks, REITs, publicly traded securities and pension funds, to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059677">I will start to wrap up now, but I want to let my colleagues on the other side of the House in on a secret. My goal today was to not only address the motion from my friends in the NDP, but eviscerate the government's failed tax policy initiatives and finish with a flourish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059678">At the end of the day, the Liberal proposal to increase the basic personal amount is a nice gesture. As Conservatives, we believe that people should pay less tax and get more value for their dollars. Canadians deserve to get ahead and not just get by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059679">It is not easy to find a humorous quote about taxes, but I think I might have. Here it is: “The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.” Who said that? It was the greatest genius of the 20th century, Albert Einstein, who discovered the theory of relativity. This man is the father of modern physics and he could not understand the tax code. What we truly need is tax simplification and comprehensive tax reform, not delivering tax policy on a piecemeal basis, as this measure does. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059680">What do we get for these exorbitant taxes? We get runaway deficits; a budget that, contrary to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s belief, does not balance itself; and Canadians who are less than $200 from insolvency at the end of the month. It seems that the more we pay, the less we get. The hill of beans and half cup of coffee per week the Liberals have proposed for 20 million taxpayers will do little to relieve the massive tax burden that the government has foisted and piled onto Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059681">Madam Speaker, I work with my colleague on the finance committee. I am a little perplexed by his conclusion. He said that the number of tax changes is relatively small. He is absolutely right about that, but he would know from his riding, as we know from ridings across the country, that people are struggling to pay for basic dental care, while other countries, like those in the United Kingdom and the European Union, provide basic dental care. The cost to the Canadian taxpayer from people who go to emergency rooms for dental care is over $150 million a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059682">I agree with the member that the government could take a much better approach, but in a minority Parliament, Conservative votes can be determinative on this issue. There is no doubt that people in his riding and right across the country need access to basic dental care. We are paying more by not having access to it than we would by putting it into place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059693">Before I address the substance of the motion, this is the first time that I have had an opportunity to rise in the House since the last election to give a speech, and I want to thank the constituents of St. Albert—Edmonton for their vote of confidence. It was an overwhelming vote of confidence of 61%, which was 16% higher than in 2015, and I am very humbled by that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059694">It would not have been possible without all of the individuals who worked so hard on my campaign, who believed in me. While I cannot name all of them, I will name two who worked harder than anyone other than perhaps myself and they are my parents, Tom and Rita Cooper. In fact, they may have worked harder than I worked.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059696">Turning to the motion before the House and the issue of increasing the basic personal amount to $15,000 from $12,298, let me say that this is nothing more than a Liberal middle-class tax gimmick. This is a government that talks a good game about the middle class. Indeed, the <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> even appointed a minister responsible for middle-class prosperity to demonstrate the Prime Minister's apparent concern for middle-class Canadians, how caring he is and always from the heart out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059697">It is certainly interesting that, when the minister appeared before the finance committee, she was unable to explain her mandate. She was asked by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252876" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> and again today in the House to define what constitutes a middle-class Canadian. She could not answer the question. However, I digress, because the fact is, despite all of the talk, what matters is not words but action, and the actions of the government time and again are to make life less affordable for middle-class Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059698">For a government that is so preoccupied with the middle class, it sure has a strange way of showing it. This, after all, is a government that scrapped tax credits that benefited middle-class Canadians. This is a government that scrapped the children's fitness tax credit, the children's arts tax credit, the student textbook tax credit, the public transit tax credit and I could go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059699"> However, not to be outdone, the government decided to jack up CPP, taking $2,200 out of the wallets of the average middle-class Canadian family. This is some way of showing its love for the middle class, nickel-and-diming them and taking money out of their wallets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059700">Of course, there is the massive tax on everything, the carbon tax, which as my friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252989" Type="2">Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley</Affiliation> noted just yesterday the Alberta Court of Appeal determined to be a “constitutional Trojan horse.” Nonetheless, the government is adamant about imposing a massive tax on middle-class Canadians. The government would say, “Don't worry, be happy, we delivered a middle-class tax cut.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059701">We heard the <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">Minister of Middle Class Prosperity</Affiliation> refer to the Liberal middle-class tax cut, which sounds like a good idea.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059702">Who could be against a middle-class tax cut? Like anything, the devil is in the details. For example, if one earned between $62,000 and $78,000, how much would that Canadian save under the Liberal middle-class tax cut? That sounds like a middle-class Canadian to me. The answer is $117. Now, is that $117 a day, a week or a month? No. It is $117 a year. How much does that work out to a week? The answer is $2.25, not even enough to purchase one extra-large regular coffee at Tim Hortons. So much for the Liberal so-called middle-class tax cut. The Liberal so-called middle-class tax cut is a Liberal middle-class tax gimmick, not to be outdone by the latest Liberal middle-class tax gimmick of increasing the basic personal amount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059703">I say, with respect to the increase that the Liberals are proposing, it is too little, too late. It is too late because Canadians would not see the full benefit for four years. I say it is too little because by the time they do, a large part of that increase will be gobbled up by inflation. While the benefit to Canadians is not going to be all that much, having regard to inflation, the government says $550, $600 for the average Canadian family. That is less than the average $800 that middle-class Canadians have seen in terms of their taxes going up, not down, under the Liberals. For this nominal benefit to some middle-class Canadians, it is going to come at an enormous cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059704">According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the cost of this Liberal middle-class tax gimmick will be $21 billion, at a time when the government is running a deficit of $26.6 billion, $7 billion more than projected with nearly $30 billion of deficits for the fiscal years ahead, with no end in sight. The <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">Minister of Middle Class Prosperity</Affiliation> talked about the government's fiscal anchor, debt-to-GDP ratio, which she says is going down, except it has actually gone up this year from 30.8% to 31%, and that is before taking into account the $55 billion of spending promises that the Liberals made in the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059705">What middle-class Canadians deserve is action. They do not deserve more talk. They do not deserve more empty promises. They do not deserve more gimmicks. Canadians deserve broad-based tax relief. It is something that Conservatives committed to. It is something we intend to deliver on should we be entrusted with the confidence of Canadians, which I expect will happen, and cannot happen soon enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059706"> In the meantime, we will hold the government to account for the fact that it has made life more unaffordable for everyday Canadians, all the while mortgaging the future generations in Canada with higher taxes, higher deficits and more debt.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059722">Madam Speaker, I would like to share my time with my friend and colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252708" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059723">The Bloc Québécois is a social democratic party. We feel strongly about redistributing wealth and ensuring equal opportunities for all. We fully support the principle of progressive taxation, and we believe it should be implemented to a greater degree. The idea is that the wealthiest contribute more to funding public services, which are universal and used by everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059724">On that note, it troubles us that the big Canadian banks are not taxed heavily enough. It is not like these companies could relocate to another country. They are in a protected market. Furthermore, I cannot overlook the fact that these multinational corporations and banks still have legal access to tax havens, which means they do not contribute as much to the public purse as they should. The rest of the population suffers, because they receive lower-quality services while paying more taxes and fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059725">As everyone knows, we think quality health care is important. We believe that a person who falls ill has basic needs and is entitled to comprehensive care. Unfortunately, the current lack of funding means that many people do not have access to the care they need. That goes for prescription drugs and dental care too. In this day and age, it makes no sense that a person with dental problems would not be able to get the care they need and see a dentist. Dental problems can be very painful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059726">Today's motion is problematic. Dental care is an aspect of health care, and health care is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces and Quebec. Ottawa's role with respect to public services and health is to provide as much funding as possible, but Ottawa has not been doing that for quite some time. This problem goes all the way back to 1996, which, as it happens, was after the Quebec referendum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059727">Ottawa decided to deal with its debt problem by slashing transfers for health, social services and education, even though expenses are rising faster in those areas than anywhere else, as we can see from budgets tabled by Quebec and the provinces. Health and education costs go up year after year, but Ottawa is providing less and less money to cover those costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059728">Originally, Ottawa promised to cover half of our health care spending. Ottawa was supposed to match every dollar spent by Quebec. This equality was completely wiped out at the end of the 1990s and the federal government has been retreating year after year ever since no matter who is in power in the House. Even though the total amount increases every year, the percentage of the federal government's contribution keeps decreasing. Quebec is now asking that Ottawa fund at least a quarter of health care spending. We are well below that and the percentage keeps going down every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059729">In the last Parliament, the Liberal government pompously announced a plan to reinvest in health care. At the end of the day, it just cancelled the Conservatives' cuts and added a few crumbs, all while interfering in this jurisdiction. At the time, Quebec's health minister, Dr. Gaétan Barrette, even accused the Liberal government in Ottawa of engaging in predatory federalism. Coming from a Quebec Liberal minister, that is saying something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059730">There is a consensus on this in Quebec City. Every year, the Government of Quebec asks Ottawa to make an annual reinvestment of 6% to make up for lost ground and get the federal government's share to a quarter of health care spending. There is also a consensus among provincial governments who are all calling for an annual increase of 5.2% in federal spending on health. Between Quebec and the provinces, everyone agrees that it is important for the federal government to make up for lost ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059731">On that, we have to take into account the aging population, since seniors require more health care, which is more expensive. At the other end of the spectrum, young people get more money for education, which only makes sense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059732">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has made several updates to his “Fiscal Sustainability Report 2018”. He noted that Ottawa is the one with the fiscal flexibility, and that the provinces have no more wiggle room. This is true to such an extent that, even if the government chose to incur massive debt and run up the debt, it would have the means of maintaining the net debt at its current level. Based on future projections, the Parliamentary Budget Officer expects that Ottawa will have completely reimbursed its debt, while the provinces will still be drowning in massive debts because funding needs in health and education are increasing, but Ottawa is contributing less and less. That is a big problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059733">The motion we are debating here infringes on provincial jurisdiction. We are not opposed to the idea of funding dental care, but we believe that that decision is up to Quebec, which does not have the money to fund all general health care services. When it comes to pharmacare, Quebec has a system that works, even though it is far from perfect. Obviously, a dental program is also necessary, but we should not be discussing it here. Our role here is to decide to increase health care funding so that the provinces can move forward with their plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059734">I would like to read out a brief passage on this subject. I will then ask the members a question.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> This asymmetry vis-à-vis du Québec can be applied in real terms through opting out with compensation. The right to opt out applies where the federal government, on its own or with the agreement of the provinces, intervenes in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction (in particular health and social services, education, family policy, housing, municipal infrastructure, etc.). In such case, no conditions or standards should be applied to Québec without its consent, obtained after consultation and negotiation. The principle of opting out is very important, as it makes it possible to reconcile the exercise of federal spending power for provinces that want it with respect for Québec's constitutional jurisdiction.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059736">As members may have guessed, I was reading a passage from the Sherbrooke declaration adopted in 2005 by the Quebec wing of the New Democratic Party of Canada. It is odd that after adopting those principles, the NDP is now moving a motion in Parliament that encroaches directly on provincial jurisdiction and does not mention that Quebec should automatically be allowed to opt out with full compensation if the federal government implements this measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059737"> Sadly, our party is no stranger to this treatment. If former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe were here today, he could remind us how many times motions like these, ones that encroached on areas of provincial jurisdiction, have been moved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059738">In closing, the Bloc Québécois is a social democratic party. We believe in quality public services, but the role of the House is to provide health funding. It is up to Quebec to decide how to invest that money, whether in emergency care, dental care or pharmacare. It is not up to the House to encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction. That is why we will be voting against today's motion.</ParaText>

However, the Bloc is choosing to penalize Quebeckers by refusing to support a motion that would provide dental care. The federal government would give this money directly to Quebec, which could decide what to do with it. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> pointed out earlier, this measure would include the right to opt out with full compensation, which goes without saying.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, that seems to happen all too often.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="252708" Type="2">Mr. Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6059762"> Madam Speaker, I read the motion moved by my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>. I must confess to this honourable House that I was blown away by this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059763">For a moment, I felt like I was in Quebec’s National Assembly or a Canadian provincial legislature. It was so surreal that I asked my assistant to pinch me. I asked him if Québec Solidaire had just tabled a motion in the House of Commons. He replied that no, it was the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059764">Under the circumstances, before I even go into what I think of how the motion is worded, I would like to remind the House that this is 2020. The fact that we are once again debating a motion that falls under provincial jurisdiction in Ottawa is incredibly sad. It shows a lack of respect for the legislators that should legitimately make those decisions based on their values and their resources. Perhaps you have heard the expression “a leopard cannot change its spots”. This is a perfect example of that concept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059765">In 2005, after spending 45 good years fighting for the centralization of legislative powers in Ottawa, the NDP adopted the famed Sherbrooke declaration, in which it claimed to recognize asymmetrical federalism and it intended to give Quebec the systematic right to opt out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059766">Today, five or six elections later, with one MP back home, they have written off Quebec and its legitimate right to legislate its own affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059767">The NDP and the member for New Westminster—Burnaby know perfectly well that health is not a federal jurisdiction. Nevertheless, they are still trying to impose social programs that Quebec and the Canadian provinces have the authority to bring in if they want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059768">No one here is against apple pie. I love apple pie. No one here is against pandas. We all love pandas. However, imposing dental care coverage through, I assume, the Canada Health Act, is nothing short of overriding the Constitution that allows us to be here—a Constitution that Quebec has never signed, by the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059769">A few seconds ago, I chose the verb “assume”. That was not a coincidence and that brings me to my second point. This motion is so vague it feels like we are heading into murky waters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059770"> The motion talks about wanting to implement dental coverage for families whose income is less than $90,000. The motion also says that benefits would be made available to individuals who earn less than $90,000 a year. With all due respect, the motion's wording is so vague that it almost contradicts itself. It does not take much imagination. One example that I am very familiar with is my own experience from around 15 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059771"> I was 23 years old. I had just had my best year in the film industry. I had been working in the industry for four years. I earned more than $90,000 that year. I bought myself a triplex with my sister. Then, my wife, Mylène, gave birth to our son Émile Duceppe, our first child. My wife was in school that year. The following year, in 2004, I earned about $30,000 because I was freelancing. I was a contract worker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059772">Since my wife was still in school and I had a mortgage to pay and we had a young boy to raise, if I had had any kind of dental problem, my previous year's income would have been used and I would not have been entitled to the dental coverage proposed today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059773">I am sorry, I lost my train of thought. Someone I know is here and that stressed me a little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059774">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Is it me?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059775">
                <B>Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe:</B> No, Madam Speaker, it is not my colleague.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059776">We were not rich, but we were doing well. According to the NDP, I would not have been entitled to dental insurance. That is exactly why Quebec and the provinces are in the best position to develop social policy. The provinces manage those sorts of things. They are closer to the people and should be the ones to administer the program. They have a legislative scalpel and not a bazooka.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059777">Once again, there is no respect for the true lawmakers in this area.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059778">While the NDP wants to give orders to Quebec and the other provinces, the provinces are asking the government for just one thing, an annual increase of 5.2% in health transfers. The provinces are not asking to have another health care program rammed down their throats. They are simply asking for an annual increase of 5.2% in health transfers. This is not rocket science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059779">While health care systems across Canada are groaning under the burden of the aging population, the NDP is talking about dental care in the wrong legislature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059780">The Quebec National Assembly even unanimously adopted a motion calling on the federal government to do its fair share with regard to health care. This does not make any sense. While the Government of Quebec estimates that the health transfer deficit will be $13.7 billion by 2027, the NDP is insisting on talking about dental coverage without even knowing how it will be paid for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059781">The federal contribution to health was 23% in 2018. Today, it is 21% and, in 2027, it will be just barely over 20%. The federal government's real problem is not the details of the health care coverage. The problem is that the House is not contributing to the rising cost of health care. What is worse, the federal government has been gradually pulling back for decades, whatever its political stripe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059782">Right now, federal health transfers are going up by just 3% per year. Health care costs are going up more than that, so the provinces are essentially getting less money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059783">Health transfers should have no strings attached. Only Quebec can determine its own priorities. Health transfers must be sufficient to provide care for our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059784">The worst thing about this motion is not just that Quebec does not want it, but that unions regard federal programs as interference. During the 2018 national consultation on implementing pharmacare, both the FTQ and the CSN emphasized the importance of taking Quebec's unique needs and independence into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059785">I would like to quote from their brief, which summarizes the situation and is relevant here. I am sure this will be of interest to our NDP colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059793">As the House devotes precious time to debating this proposal, can we at least agree to respect the sharing of legislative powers? That is why we were elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059794">The Bloc wants to work collaboratively. We like that, and we proved it last week. However, when we are forced to work on somewhat vague and incongruous texts that are written almost deliberately to be rejected by certain parliamentary groups, it seems to me that our debates lose some of their relevance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059797">Madam Speaker, first of all, the motion does not provide enough detail to indicate how we would get that money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059798">Second, this is about areas of jurisdiction. The expression “areas of jurisdiction” includes the word “jurisdiction”. I think that is fabulous. This is Quebec's jurisdiction. What is unfortunate is that it would have been so easy for the NDP to indicate in the motion that Quebec would have the right to opt out with full compensation. It would not have been complicated to write. We were told earlier that that was a given. History tells us that it is not really a given. It would have been so simple to include it in the motion, and perhaps that would have facilitated discussions between our parties. Unfortunately, I sometimes get the impression that too much electioneering goes on in this place. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, our constituents pay the price.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059800">First, the Liberal tax cut, which we have talked about a lot today, proposes increasing the exemption ceiling and it would reduce taxes for 20 million Canadians. The Conservatives, of course, have said they are against it, and the New Democrats would reduce some of that. Is the member in favour of that tax cut for 20 million Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059801">Second, the health committee has decided to study dental care, which I am definitely in favour of. I wonder what positive contribution the member thinks the Bloc will make to that discussion in the health committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059802">Madam Speaker, we are in favour of having the wealthy make a greater contribution. It only makes sense. The Bloc Québécois is a social democratic party and we are progressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059803">In answer to the second part of the question, I would say once again that this is a provincial jurisdiction. If I may add something, as my hon. colleague suggested, I would say that Quebec needs to be given the right to opt out with full compensation every time. It is as simple as that. Unfortunately, the Liberals have proven in the past that this is not their cup of tea. The cuts to health transfers came from the Liberals. It was Paul Martin who made the biggest cuts to health, and now the provinces are suffering the consequences. It hurts Quebec and Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059804">This has been going on for years. This is an opportunity to increase these transfers. We are calling on all hon. members to work together to increase health transfers. That is what we want. Sadly, we have no lessons to learn from the governments that sat in the benches across the way, regardless of political stripe, because the Bloc Québécois is doing its job. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059810">Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity to speak to the motion before the House. The motion calls upon the government to reallocate a portion of the resources that will be spent on a tax cut for what is called the middle class to people who really need it and do not have dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059811">It is my pleasure to do this because this is a historic occasion. It is not very often that members of the House of Commons have the opportunity to pass a resolution that would benefit millions of Canadians now and in future generations. This is the first step in ensuring greater equality in this country, an equality about something that is extremely important to individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059812">Dental care is pretty basic for people who can afford it. Their income allows them to pay for the services of a dentist to get their teeth cleaned, annual inspections, X-rays, if needed, and whatever else goes with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059813">Madam Speaker, I am sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="253024" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation>. I am very happy to do that and I look forward to his speech as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059814">He, along with me and other members of our caucus, are very much in favour of ensuring that everybody in Canada has access to quality dental care. It should already be a part of our health care system. In fact, in 1964, it was part of the design of medicare to include dental care, but during the negotiations and when it was passed, dental care was left out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059815">What we have is a gap. When someone breaks his or her wrist, the person can go to a hospital or a doctor and have a cast put on. The person can get the physiotherapy at the hospital that is needed. The person can be looked after. However, when people have a cavity or they break a tooth or they need work done to ensure their oral health, they have to pay for it. Why is that? There was a failure to follow through on the promise and hope of a general health care system that would include dental care. Of course, pharmacare was also part of the original design.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059816">I go back to generations ago to the great leader, the first leader of the national NDP when it was formed, Tommy Douglas. He campaigned for many decades to ensure there was greater equality in obtaining health care for people in this country. That is exactly what this motion is aimed at as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059817">We joined the campaign. We put this forward as an idea that we would want to put in place. We campaigned on it. We let it be known. People were very interested for reasons that were fairly obvious to me, knowing as I do, and I am sure hon. members know that when we talk about the middle class in this country, that is a pretty vague notion. I do not think the minister is able to tell us who is included in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059818">We do know that the people who do not have and cannot afford dental care know who they are and they do not think they are in the middle class. They know they are not in a position to have what others have and are entitled to. This motion would give all those people the right to dental care just the same as everybody else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059819">This motion comes about because of the Liberal government's plan, and it promised this, of having a middle-class tax cut. What do the Liberals mean by that? We do not know, but we do know the plan the Liberals put forward is going to cost in excess of $6 billion per year once it is fully in place. That $6 billion is a lot of money. It is essentially taxpayers' money that is now being collected which the government proposes to spend out of general revenues to give a tax cut to certain people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059820">That tax cut would go to people who earn up to $130,000 per year. The maximum benefit is $347 per year, I believe. That would go to the people who are in the upper income bracket. The lower we go down on the scale, the less the benefit is. When one gets down below $40,000, I think the benefit is about zero.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059821">Who is this benefiting? Is this benefiting people who do not have an income to pay the kind of tax that would benefit from this? Is it going to people who do not need it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059822">The Liberals can say they are going to have a middle-class tax cut, and they will fulfill their promise, but this is a Parliament that is supposed to work together. We could make a significant improvement to this plan by saying that the Liberals could do their tax cut but we should ask why they are giving it to people who are already making $90,000 or more a year. That $300, or $340 maximum, is not going to change their lives. They might like to have $300; who would not? However, I question whether they need it in the same sense as people who are in a situation where they cannot afford dental care, and do not have access to it. It could change their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059823">I say that because dental care is extremely important to one's health and well-being. Not only is it important to one's health and well-being, but if we think of children growing up who do not have access to dental care, it affects their well-being, their health, their digestion, and their social standing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059824"> Everybody in this House knows there is a big divide in this country. There is a divide between people who have good teeth and people who do not have access to the care that is required to make sure they have proper oral health. That is not fair. It is a great inequality. It is one of the most unequal aspects of health care in Canada, because most dental care is not covered by public health insurance. Some emergency care is. Someone may have an abscess in a tooth, because the person has not had the opportunity to go to a dentist to have proper dental care, or to have cavities filled and the person is forced to wait and endure the pain that comes with that. The person will go to a hospital emergency room and have an emergency extraction which costs the health care system several hundred dollars, but the person no longer has a tooth. Then the person is affected by that for the rest of his or her life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059825"> That is the reality. That is unfair and it is unnecessary. It is an inequality that can be fixed. We, in this House of Commons, have an opportunity today to pass a resolution that would allow that to change. We do not need to give a $300 tax break to someone making $125,000 a year. However, we do need to ensure that everybody has fair access to health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059826">During the campaign, we announced our platform and we announced that program in particular. People were coming up to me in the streets. They had heard about this and wanted to know more. They thought it was great. I do not want to try to paint too weird a picture, but people asked me to look at their teeth and asked whether I thought they could get a job with the way their teeth looked. That is the reality. People know they are excluded from employment and certain social activities. It affects their lives in many ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059827">I remember an older gentleman in his seventies was almost crying, telling me how he had had cancer and as a result had serious problems with his teeth. He had to get a couple of teeth replaced or refilled. He had some done that he thought were paid for by the province, but they were not. He had to pay for that himself. He said that he had to wait two years to save up enough money to fix his other teeth. That was terrible. He was not interested in voting or in participating. I told him that the way to change things was by voting for something he wants and needs. I hope he did. I did not check with him afterwards.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6059847">Madam Speaker, it is a great honour again to stand in the House and speak on behalf of my wonderful constituents of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059848"> I am going into my fifth year as a member of the House and during my time here, I have known nothing but a Liberal government. I did work for a previous member of Parliament during the time the Conservatives were in power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059849">Over the last numbers of years, I have watched the Liberal government make a number of choices. I will start with what it calls a middle-class tax cut, which in fact sent the lion's share of the benefits to people making six-figure incomes. I remember at the time telling Liberal MPs in this place that they gave themselves the maximum tax cut and that people who earned the median income, which is just over $40,000 per year, would receive nothing. That is just a correction for the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059850">We also have the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action, and the Liberals have only implemented a handful of those 94 calls to action. This is a government that chose to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money to buy the TMX pipeline. It has inadequate climate targets. It is waffling on pharmacare. Today we are getting lukewarm support for what the NDP is proposing for dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059851">Governing is about choices. I think back to the words of the late Jack Layton, when he said that we could not just be a party of opposition, that we had to be a party of proposition. That is exactly what today's motion would do. It is the NDP bringing forward a motion to the House, which would have real and tangible benefits for many Canadians suffering from a lack of care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059852">If we go back to the throne speech, there was a cursory mention of dental care, as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059853">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The Government is open to new ideas from all Parliamentarians, stakeholders, public servants, and Canadians—ideas like universal dental care are worth exploring, and I encourage Parliament to look into this.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059854">We are looking into this. We took the words of the Governor General, and we are doing precisely that. In fact, regarding the proposal for dental care, a poll was done last year by IPSOS. It showed that around 86% of Canadians would support providing publicly funded dental care to those without insurance coverage. Eighty-six per cent is a pretty comfortable majority of Canadians. I know that no matter what side of the political spectrum one represents, constituents in every riding of the country need dental care. They are suffering because of poor oral health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059855">Our proposal is very simple. One of the first things the Liberal government proclaimed it would do was with regard to taxes. The Liberals want to essentially take the basic personal amount and raise it in stages, so the amount of income a person would not pay taxes on would rise to the first $15,000 by the year 2023. This would then slowly slope off to the cut-off income of $150,000 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059856">People who are earning six figures are going to receive most of the benefit. The NDP proposes that we take that proposal but instead limit it to people who earn $90,000 a year or less, in other words, to people who actually need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059857">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that if the proposed Liberal tax change comes into effect with the income going up to $150,000, it will cost the Canadian treasury $6.2 billion by the year 2024-25 after the full impact has kicked in. I remind all hon. members that tax changes actually cost money. If we are just giving a rather small benefit to the people who do not need it, then what measurable benefit are we giving Canadian society?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059858">Meanwhile, a huge number of Canadians do not have any dental coverage. They do not have that oral health. We have a real opportunity here to take something, shift it slightly so there still is a tax change, but use the resultant savings to invest in a national dental care plan and get people the help they require.</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the House call on the government to change its proposed tax cuts by targeting benefits to those who earn less than $90,000 per year, and use those savings to invest in priorities that give real help to Canadians, including dental coverage for uninsured families making less than $90,000 per year.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059861">We need to look at some of the statistics to understand why this proposal is so important. We know that emergency room visits due to dental emergencies cost taxpayers at least $155 million annually. According to Statistics Canada, in 2018, 35.4% of Canadians reported they had no dental insurance, and 22.4% of Canadians, which is roughly 6.8 million people, avoided visiting dental professionals due to the cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059862">We know the health literature studies have linked poor oral health to serious health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, respiratory infections, diabetic complications, renal disease complications, premature birth and low birth weight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059863">We can look at where we can make those targeted investments in society that will have real impact. Yes, the upfront costs will be quite expensive, because we are going to have to bring a large portion of the population up to a standard of care. However, those costs will start to go down over time. We will see the results in savings in our medical system when we do not have to spend the money to deal with much more complicated health problems down the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059864">This is a real opportunity for us to come together and make a difference in this place. I ask members to look at the situation in their own ridings, at what so many of their constituents are facing and to make a real difference by passing this motion. We have a choice before us. Are we going to spend our limited time in this place to give money to people who do not need it or are we going to make that investment to ensure Canadians are getting the help they need?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059865">I have been listening to the debate today and members who spoke previously brought together a lot of personal stories, of meeting constituents, residents in their communities who had to cover their mouth because they were embarrassed by the state of their teeth or had further complications going down the line, which had led to multiple hospital visits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059866"> In many ways, oral health is still very much a class issue. People who have means, who have income, have good teeth. People who do not have that source of income usually have poor oral health. This is an opportunity to give people another rung on social mobility, to give them the ability to go forward, to have confidence in seeking a new job, to be more open, to really participate in society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059867">Our dental care plan as members of Parliament is very generous. In fact, we have so much privilege in this place. We command an amazing salary. We have incredible health and dental benefits. Why do we feel comfortable as parliamentarians to give ourselves that coverage, yet we balk at the cost of giving it to our constituents?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059868">Can we honestly make that argument to the public when in our constituencies, that we as members of Parliament deserve dental care that they do not have? I do not think many of us can. If members are going to make that argument, I would think twice about sitting in this place, because constituents might have better ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059869">I know my time is coming to a close, but I will end by imploring all of my colleagues, no matter which political party, to seriously look at this proposal, look at the good it will do for the people of Canada and take this moment to come together in this minority Parliament, pass the motion and get our country onto a path where we can cover people for dental care, which will have a very real and measurable impact in their lives.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="253848" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6059886">Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to stand in the House and represent the residents of Winnipeg North. I rise to provide some comments that are fairly widely accepted, at least among Liberal members of the House of Commons. I would suggest that through working on all sides of the House we have been able to bridge some common support for good initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059887">I would break what we are discussing today down into two issues. The first is dental coverage. Depending on which member is speaking, the New Democrats and the Bloc members spend some time talking about dental coverage. The Conservatives, on the other hand, have more of a fixation on taxes. I have good news for both the official opposition and my New Democrat friends. I hope to address both of those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059888">I will start by talking about the election of 2015. Back in 2015, we had a real change in course through the change in government with our current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It was a change for the first time after many years under Stephen Harper. I know I should be somewhat careful when I say that, because it tends to scare a few people. When Stephen Harper was the prime minister, it was very rare for us to see anything of a progressive nature taking place, whether it was regarding health care, our environment or any other type of initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059889">Since 2015, we have had, for the first time in many years, an opportunity to see a number of areas progress. One of which I am very proud is the issue of pharmacare. For many years I sat in opposition here in the House of Commons. For even more years I sat in opposition in the Manitoba legislature. Health care was a very important issue. Dental care was an important issue, even back then. In 2015 the government, from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office right through, indicated that we wanted the standing committee of health to look at a national pharmacare program, or something of that nature, that would be able to provide more affordable medications for Canadians in all regions of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059890">As members of the House will know, the standing committee came up with an excellent report. I have had the opportunity to review some of the comments that came out of that particular report, and over the last few years we have seen a great deal of lobbying. A good percentage of that lobbying, in a very effective way, took place since that report. I have heard this from unions, and more importantly from constituents. Day after day in the last session, I brought forward petitions with hundreds of signatures from residents of Winnipeg North saying they wanted to see some form of a national pharmacare program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059891">We need to recognize that it is not as simple as some would try to imply. Back then, the New Democrats would tell us to just wave our wand, and we would have a national pharmacare program. They know better. We cannot just click our heels and make things happen like that. We have to work with the different levels of government. We have to try to present the case, and ultimately it is going to take a great deal of work to bring in a system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059892">We have invested literally tens of millions of dollars trying to further this, so that we will have some form of a national pharmacare program. Prior to this administration, I do not ever recall hearing the debate on national pharmacare, and the idea behind it, to the degree to which we have been hearing it in the last four years. I am glad to see the progress we have made. We have had ministers of health who have had a profoundly positive impact on the reduction of the costs of medications, in particular for hospitals and institutions, through the way in which we purchase prescribed medicines.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059893">We now have a motion on the floor that in part deals with a dental plan. Again, the NDP is in a dream world. My friends often say New Democrats are like Liberals in a hurry. This is the type of thing that cannot just be wished into being. We have to do the background work. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sent the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> a mandate letter in which he asked her to look into how we might be able to expand the debate of how we could do what we started with pharmacare, taking dental care into consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059894">The Standing Committee on Health is going to study this issue. When I posed a question to my NDP friend, he said standing committees do all sorts of reports and so forth. Over the last four years our government has demonstrated that, when it comes to the pharmacare issue, we take it very seriously. Not only was the pharmacare issue mentioned in the mandate letter to the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, but a standing committee is going to deal with it. If it is doable, we are interested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059895">We recognize that not all Canadians have dental coverage. We also recognize that while there is some direct benefit to dental coverage, we have to look at the best way to realize dental coverage for those individuals who will be in need of that service in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059896">Whether it is the mandate letter, the standing committee or the dialogue, pharmacare has been mentioned many times. I have had the opportunity to talk about pharmacare on many different occasions here in the House. I have even had the opportunity to reference dental care. I have talked about it with my constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059897">Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants our caucus members to get a sense of what our constituents want. He wants us to bring their asks and what they are feeling in our constituencies back to Ottawa, whether on the floor of the House, in standing committees or in our caucus discussions. He wants to ensure that our constituents' concerns are brought to Ottawa so that we have an understanding of them. Not everything takes place in the Ottawa bubble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059898">That is why we have seen this government take a number of progressive actions dealing with not only health care and the environment but also taking progressive steps toward developing our country through infrastructure. We could talk about the CPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059899">When we talk about pharmacare or a dental plan, we have to talk and work with the provinces, because there is a jurisdictional area there. The Bloc has already highlighted that on several occasions. There is a sense that we need to work with the stakeholders, and the provinces in particular. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059900">We have a good example of just how successful we were on another progressive issue: the Canada pension plan. For years, Stephen Harper ignored it. He did absolutely nothing. Many years before he was prime minister, one would question whether he even supported the CPP and the idea behind it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059901">Within a couple of years, through the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and other members of cabinet working with the provinces, we were able to get an agreement that enhanced the CPP. The workers of today will have more money when it comes time for them to retire. That is an example that really demonstrates how this government treats those issues that are of critical importance to Canadians. We are looking at those issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059902">I want to give some attention to Conservative members, who at times underestimate what we have been able to do while making progressive changes with regard to taxation and the redistribution of what I would classify as wealth in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059903">Remember that within a couple of months of the 2015 election, one of the very first pieces of legislation we introduced, and I know the House is familiar with it, was the tax break to Canada's middle class. That was a tax cut. At the time, the Conservatives voted against those middle-class tax breaks. What is interesting is the Conservatives stand up and say they want more tax breaks, but when they actually had a chance to vote for tax breaks, what did they do? Every one of them stood up and voted no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059904">Then we heard that the 1% wealthiest should pay a little more in taxes, so we brought forward a votable item to increase taxes on Canada's wealthiest 1%. Not only did the Conservatives vote against that, which surprised me, but so did the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059905"> That is why I find today's motion interesting. The New Democrats are saying we should not give a tax break in one area so we can funnel that money into another area. I have heard that before. They believe we should have a tax for corporations here, put a tax there, click our heels and make things happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059906">In the 2015 election, the New Democrats talked about a multi-million-dollar housing strategy proposal. We came up with a multi-billion-dollar first-time-ever housing strategy that goes for 10 years. It is the single greatest investment in housing. How did they respond to it? They said it was not enough, yet it was 10 times the amount they were talking about in the election. That was the election where they were advocating for balancing the budget. I think it is because they have this sense that whatever the government does they have to try and one-up it. If we say we are going to build 1,000 homes, they will say they will build 5,000 homes. If we say we are working toward a national pharmacare program, they will not only say it was their idea, but now they want a national dental care program. When it comes to my NDP friends, it is never-ending. That is something I witnessed when they were in opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059907">When I was in the Manitoba legislature, it was quite the opposite. It may be hard to believe, but I believe the Manitoba government gave six tax reductions on corporate taxes in 15 years. That is more than the Conservatives did. I would suggest that the NDP in government and the NDP in opposition are two different animals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059908">When we look at the bigger picture of what we have been able to accomplish by working with Canadians over the last number of years, the <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">Minister of Middle Class Prosperity</Affiliation> said it well. We had the middle-class tax break. We had the tax increase to Canada's wealthiest 1%. We had the Canada child benefit program enhancement. As I have often said inside this chamber, that particular program saw over $9 million a month going to the riding of Winnipeg North to support our children. We had the increase to the guaranteed income supplement, lifting hundreds of seniors out of poverty in the riding of Winnipeg North alone. We just had a report from Stats Canada that indicated that the number of people who have been lifted out of poverty in three years is over one million. Never in the history of Canada have we ever seen, in a three-year period, one million people lifted out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059909">That tells me that the government is doing it right, that by working with Canadians we are making a positive difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059910"> When we look at why it is so important that we get it right, and we look at where those tax dollars and those tax breaks and the enhancement of the child benefit and our seniors program are going, the reality is that they are putting dollars into the pockets of the Canadians who need them the most. When we do that, we are increasing their disposable income. By increasing Canadians' disposable income, we are allowing Canadians to spend more in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059911">That in itself assists in building the economy. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and other Liberals will say that by supporting our middle class and giving our middle class strength, we are strengthening our economy. Again, the proof is in the pudding. By working with Canadians, we have created well over one million jobs since 2015, and most of those are full-time jobs. I would compare our record with the Stephen Harper record, any day on anything.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> The member might not want to say, “done” too quickly because they will be embarrassed if they accept that challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059914">Madam Speaker, we look at the policies that have been put in place, both on the progressive side in terms of programs like the CPP and budgetary measures such as tax cuts. If we look at the investments in Canadians, specifically the record amounts of money in infrastructure, we see that unlike the former government we actually believe in infrastructure. A healthier infrastructure is good for the economy. We know that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059915">On this side, we get it. By addressing all three areas, we have witnessed a relatively healthy economy over the last number of years that has generated record numbers of jobs and has reduced unemployment rates to historical levels in certain areas of the country. These are the types of things that are having a positive impact on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059916">In the most recent budget, we are talking about increasing the basic allotment amount from just over $12,000 to $15,000 over the next few years. My Conservative friends will say that is not a tax cut. I always say a tax cut is a tax cut is a tax cut. It is, in fact, a tax cut. Those individuals will be paying less tax, as a direct result, once again, of another Liberal initiative. That is incorporated and coming up. We are going to see some wonderful things in the not-too-distant future. Those are the types of things that will keep us on the road that we are currently on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059917">We, collectively on the government benches, understand the importance of working with Canadians, consulting with our constituents and coming up with the ideas that are ultimately going to take form in different ways through legislation, through budgetary motions and just through government policy in general. We are in contact with ministers and we provide direct input, whether inside this chamber, in our caucus or in the standing committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059918">I will leave it at that, but I would suggest that we are going to get a lot more when we get the chance to look at the next budget.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6059919">Madam Speaker, I want to put it on the record, just to be clear, I do not think I have ever agreed with that member. However, there are a few points in his speech that I agree with today. I certainly agreed that the NDP ridiculed the Liberal national housing strategy in 2015. The member said that we said it was not enough, and I certainly agree with that. It was not enough because there was nothing there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059920">The problem with the Liberals is they think that if they keep saying something it will become true. When we kept trying to find out where the national housing strategy was, we had the national housing strategy person, the member for <Affiliation DbId="252847" Type="2">Spadina—Fort York</Affiliation>, who got up very defensively, said that they had helped over a million Canadians. We wanted to know where the million Canadians were. Then when the member was questioned on it, it turned out he had just made that up. He said it was for rhetorical advantage, to misrepresent numbers about a basic housing strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059921">If we listen to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, someone the Liberals seem dead set against and have tried to undermine, his latest comments on the Liberal national housing strategy are that they maintain “current funding levels for current activities and slightly reduced targeted funding” for current activities. If we get through the bureaucratese and economics of that, it means the Liberals have basically been putting jack squat into a national housing strategy and they plan to maintain a jack squat national housing strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059922">That leads me to my final point. I agree with the member that the Liberals are always willing to put money in the pockets of people they think need it the most, like Galen Weston, $12 million to fix his fridges. The Liberals think he needs that the most. We are here talking about people who cannot get dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059923">I do not know if the member understands what it is like to be without dental care, but I meet people without dental care all time and they are not people in the Liberal universe. We are here to say we could have a reasonable strategy to help with dental care or we could have more and more of this kind of Liberal rhetoric for advantage that helps no one.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059924">Madam Speaker, when the member makes reference to rhetoric, for almost 20 years I sat opposition in the Manitoba legislature, and for roughly 15 of those years the NDP was in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059925">Many, and particularly members from the Bloc, will say that the provinces do have a role to play in dental care. Some of the saddest stories we could hear are from northern rural Manitoba, and a lot of the inner city areas in Winnipeg North. The need is there, and it is very real. I have said that. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has acknowledged that. The <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has acknowledged that. All Liberals recognize the issue. For years and years, the NDP in Manitoba never got it done. It refused to address that particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059926">Now the NDP in opposition here in Ottawa is saying that we have to deal with it. The standing committee is going to be dealing with it. There is going to be a study in regard to it. We are very hopeful and optimistic that if we can work with provinces and support provinces, we might be able to do something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059927">We are starting the ball going forward, which is more than I could have said during the 15 years I was in opposition, when the NDP was in government and when it virtually ignored the issue completely.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059928">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate with my colleague opposite. The member raised the dynamic where the NDP sees the government doing something and says it is never enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059929">From a Conservative viewpoint, we have a very similar observation when members on that side get pressed for the way they conduct their business. Immediately, the point their finger and start blaming Mr. Harper for areas that were directly under their control. It is interesting that this member still does not see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059930">While I am on the subject of things that the member may not see, I do appreciate the member's commitment to the House and his engagement on so many files, but he is not doing his rookie members any favours by constantly getting up and robbing them of the chance to defend their government and to actually cut their teeth in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059931">In all seriousness, the member did raise the subject of tax cuts versus raising the threshold, saying a tax cut is a tax cut is a tax cut and it is all the same. If we agree with that, it is effect and not the actual substance that matters, the government continues to say things like “A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian” and yet it keeps talking about working for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059932">I am getting very tired and frustrated with this. I want everyone in Canada to do well. Utilizing the term “middle class” kind of stratifies people into little boxes. I would ask the member, who served as an MLA and as an MP, whether he would ever go into his constituency office and say, “You're middle class, so I'm going to help you. You're not middle class, so I'm not going to help you. You're making too much money, so I'm not going to help you” or would the member say it is his duty to stand up and try to make sure that everyone could get ahead, that everyone's children and grandchildren could be better off.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059933">Madam Speaker, actions speak louder than words, and all one has to do is take a look at the Canada child benefit program and look at the way in which Stephen Harper worked it under the old system. Millionaires were being subsidized, and it did not matter if one made $10,000 a year or $150,000 a year: There was no difference in terms of amounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059934">One of the first actions we took and have enhanced since then was to recognize that some individuals need more than others. That is reflected in the policies. It is the same thing we are doing with the tax changes this year by increasing the basic exemption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059935">There are many examples I could give. I can tell my friend across the way that we always try to arrange it so that whoever walks into my office in Winnipeg North walks away happier than when they came in.

Again and again, he made cuts to transfer payments to Quebec that amounted to almost $2 billion, which led to what is known as a fiscal imbalance. Even today, intense pressure is placed on provincial governments when the federal government can more or less balance its budget by reducing transfer payments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059940">There was a time in the early nineties when there was an agreement we would have a tax change. Provinces were given a tax shift, given more money through taxes, and in return the money was taken away from health care transfers. Jean Chrétien said no, and said that we would establish a floor to ensure the federal government would always have an interest in providing support for heath care for the provinces throughout the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059941">If we take a look at the many years we have been in government since then, particularly the last four years, we see that today we give more money to health care than we have ever given before. Not only do we do that, but we also highlight issues we believe are important to all Canadians, including mental health. This is an area that we talk a great deal about. We talk about the issue of palliative care, on which we have had much debate inside this chamber, and issues such as dental plans or pharmacare plans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059942">These are important issues for all Canadians. It does not matter where they live. If there is an interest, this government is listening. Where we can act, we act. We have demonstrated that. Every day we work as hard as we can to deliver good-quality services for Canadians, and we have a heck of a good civil service to make sure that happens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059943">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059944">I would like to thank my NDP colleagues for using the first opposition day to urge the government to work collaboratively for working-class Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059945">In this minority Parliament, the Liberals have a choice. They can provide a tax break to people who are making more than $90,000 a year or they can offer dental coverage to families making less than $90,0000 annually. In fact, if I were the Liberals, I would be jumping at the chance to support an opportunity to work so well for Canadians. What we have been able to provide here is an opportunity for the Liberals to see what they could accomplish instead of giving a few more dollars to people who do not actually need the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059946">We know right now that we are leaving millions of Canadians behind. They cannot afford to go to the dentist. We know that this is causing incredible stress on our emergency rooms. We are spending $155 million annually on dental-related emergencies. These are preventive things. This is money we would not have to be spending if we had dental care for people who need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059947">By providing access to oral health, we would also ensure that we are preventing other serious health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, respiratory infections, diabetic complications, renal disease complications and premature birth and low birth weight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059948">We need to start protecting all Canadians, particularly those who are most vulnerable. I have spent a great deal of time in my riding of Edmonton Strathcona, which is a very diverse riding. There are large number of students in my riding, and there is a large diversity in socio-economic status. I have spent a lot of time on doorsteps talking to people, and I am unbelievably surprised by the incredible support for a dental program in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059949">What is interesting to me is that it is not just those people who would benefit from a dental program who are so supportive of it. It is, in fact, Canadians of all economic backgrounds, whether they can afford their own dental care or not, who recognize that we have an obligation to make sure all people within our community are taken of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059950">I spoke to a constituent of mine, a young father who lived in a lovely home and clearly had a level of income that is quite comfortable. He had two daughters. He spoke to me at length about his support for medicare, pharmacare, mental health care and dental care. I said to him that he obviously had the money to take his kids to the dentist and asked him why he was worried about dental care. His response to me, which is something every person in this House needs to acknowledge, was that his children's well-being and his well-being depend on his community and country doing well. He was worried about the kids at his daughters' school and their ability to access dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059951">If Canadians like this young father can be generous and understand the obligation we have to represent Canadians and do what is best for Canada, I really find it problematic that there are people in this House who do not recognize it. We know that across Canada there is incredible support for a dental program, and the majority of Canadians who have elected us to represent them in this House have asked for and supported dental care. What right do we have to not support that? What right do we have to not support dental care when the people who put us in this building to represent them have said that they want dental care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059952">It is also really important, and people have brought this up before, that we talk a bit about how the Liberals say that there is no money for things that they do not want to put money into while there is always, always money for the things they think are important. This is not the first time that members will hear this, but Loblaws does not need Canadian taxpayer dollars. Mastercard does not Canadian taxpayer dollars. The ones who do need it are young families who cannot afford their dental care and university students and families who are struggling to make ends meet in my province, where 19,000 people were laid off in January. Those people need support. They need support to be able to access dental care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059953">A budget is coming out in our province today, and it is not going to get better there. There are people hurting in Alberta, and this is a concrete thing that I and all members can fight for on behalf of our constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059954">I would also like to take a moment to offer to my Conservative colleagues the thought that millions of Canadians do not have dental care, but the biggest benefits from the Liberal tax cuts go to the wealthy. Conservatives talk a lot about standing up for working Canadians, so I can only assume that they will be supporting our plan to cap the cut for the wealthiest and invest those savings in a dental care plan that will benefit millions of hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059955">I am so proud to be a New Democrat, to represent Edmonton Strathcona and to have a proposal that would immediately help 4.3 million people and save our health care system tens of millions of dollars each year. It is time we started delivering on the needs of everyday Canadians and it is time we started investing in Canadians and their needs. Dental care is health care. Canadians should not have to choose between taking care of their teeth and taking care of their health.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059956">Madam Speaker, I have a distributional analysis from the PBO. I looked at 2024, as an example. If we capped it at $97,000, meaning $97,000 and up, there would be savings of about $934 million, which is not insignificant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059957">My question is about dental coverage, because there is a question about spending that $934 million on dental care when it has not been fully studied in this place and it is really within provincial jurisdiction. I am not discounting it as a priority, but why would we not look to something like the Canada workers benefit, which would have a direct impact on poverty and be much better targeted? It is within the purpose of the motion and it would clearly be within federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6059978">Madam Speaker, I am always honoured to rise in the House to represent the people of Timmins—James Bay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059979"> For the folks back home, what we are discussing today is something on which the Liberal government has promised to work collegially, in this minority Parliament, to try to bring solutions, without our throwing brickbats at each other. However, as we are seeing throughout this debate, the Liberals are absolutely dead set against a reasonable solution. The solution is for a serious problem: the lack of dental care for more and more Canadians across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059980">I talked to a young woman the other day who said something that I thought was very powerful. She said that in Canada today the economic dividing line is between those who have dental care and those who do not. Those who do not have dental care are put at such a basic sense of risk, and there is also a risk of damage to self-worth. From knocking on the doors in my region and in my community, I have seen the impacts of not having access to dental care. In the great regions in the Far North, in the communities of the Cree, the dental crisis is a serious medical crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059981">What are we proposing? Whenever we come forward with a reasonable suggestion, the Liberals say, “There is the crazy NDP, pie in the sky. It is never good enough.” They tell us to stick with the Liberals, who make all the great promises but do not ever actually deliver. The pharmacare promise came so long ago that I think I was a child at the time. At least emotionally I was a child. The Liberals are still promising pharmacare, but we just have to wait a bit longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059982">A great analogy for this relates to a loaf of bread. Why fight for a big loaf of bread? We can cut half a loaf of bread and give it to Galen Weston and tell everyone else they are loved and cared for. We are so cared for that the Liberals now have a <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">Minister of Middle Class Prosperity</Affiliation>. If this were a drinking game, and every time the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said “middle class” we had to take a drink and then a shot for the follow-up line “those trying to join it”, people would be bombed at the end of a four-minute speech by a member of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059983">I say that in all seriousness, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> grew up in a very different middle class than my father and mother did. I do not know the middle class he grew up with in the town of Mount Royal, but my mother and father were the children of hard rock miners. My mom quit school at 15 and got a job. My dad quit school at 16 and got a job. He became a member of the middle class at 40, when he could go to university. My mom would type his notes when he would come home after 12 hours on an all-night bus to Timmins. By getting a university degree, he became a professor of economics. That was the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059984">Middle class meant that my dad could buy a little house. It was not a big house, and it took him 25 years to pay it off. We had one car, and when that car died it just stayed in the driveway. My dad never got another one. Middle class meant that his kids could go to school and come out without debt, because he had a summer job. That was the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059985">When we ask the <Affiliation DbId="253398" Type="4">middle class prosperity minister </Affiliation> what the middle class is, she says it is hard to define, that it is for people who have stuff. That is it? She says it is for people who have kids in hockey. What about the families who do not have kids in hockey? What about the families who are working three jobs full time and are not able to pay their rent?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059986"> It is called the gig economy. The <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, who is pretty much the minister of the 1%, tells us to get used to it; it is the new normal. It is not the new normal. It is the direct result of deliberate economic policies by the Liberals and the Conservatives, going back and forth, policies that have deteriorated the once strong middle class that was the basis of the economic engine in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059987">When we talk about dental care now, with people who have to make a choice among paying their rent, looking after their children, getting their car fixed so that they can get to work and getting their teeth fixed, we are in a very different economic reality. What is the solution? It is quite simple. The Liberals, whenever they do not know what to do, give money to wealthy people and tell us that we will all benefit. The first thing the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> did was give a tax cut to the middle class and those wanting to join it. In other words, those making $150,000 a year are going to love the Liberals, and for those making $40,000 a year, they have nothing but a lot of nice affirmations.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6059988">The minister of the 1% has given us $14 billion in tax cuts over the last five years. These are cuts to revenue that could be used to invest in things the Liberals say they support, like pharmacare, and address the horrific shortage in national housing. They keep saying housing will receive the greatest and most incredible investment ever, but they are just not spending money on it. They do not even know where the money is because they gave it away in tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059989">What about their latest tax cut? Those who make $150,000 a year will do very well, but those who make less will get very little to diddly-squat. The reasonable alternative is to say that those making $90,000 or more do not need the extra money and to take that money and put it into a national dentistry fund to help 1.4 million Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059990">The Liberals seem to think these finances are shocking. The finances were not shocking when they wrote a cheque of $4.5 billion to Trans Mountain to get it to go away. Then we bought ourselves a pipeline, and now they are adding $1 billion every few months, no problem there. They did not have to factor that out. They did not have to cost it out. Now they are asking how to cost out a national dental care program. What we know is that in the first year it will be used by a lot of people, but then it will settle in at about $800 million a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059991">It is pretty clear that if we decide not to give more benefits to the rich, the people who so-called have all the stuff, and put in a dental plan, it will make life much better for many Canadians. It is doable, but it is about political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059992">The other issue is about federal and provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059993">Quebec clearly has a lot of credibility when it comes to providing services to its people. The NDP upholds the principle of asymmetrical federalism. If the Government of Quebec decided to offer a program, it would be able to develop a plan and receive federal funding. That is reasonable. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6059994">To the other provinces, like Jason Kenney's Alberta, which would love a national dental care plan and then would give it to some oil executives, we would say no, that the money has to go to dental care. We have to protect the rights of citizens in this. If we are going to change how we tax money to help people, we have to make sure it will go there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059995">In my 16 years in the House, I have seen a continual deterioration of the middle class through deliberate policies, like the policies that downloaded the cost of university tuition onto students year after year so that students are now coming out with $50,000 or $60,000 to $100,000 in debt that they cannot get out of. I have seen the rise of the so-called precarious gig economy, precarious because it favours corporations, as it does not require standards to be in place for employment. It is crippling the young generation that is carrying those costs. I have seen the rise of housing prices in urban areas and in rural areas like mine, where right now 2,000 homeless people are in the area of the city of Timmins, a city of 44,000 people. Despite all the volunteers we have, they cannot address that crisis without a national investment. What do we get from the government? It says we have the greatest national housing investment ever, but we are not seeing any buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059996">This is about choice. It is about the choice to invest in housing. It is about the choice to invest in our students. It is about the choice to invest in infrastructure. Here we have a clear choice to not give to the rich and make a plan to establish a national dental care plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6059997">I appeal to my Liberal colleagues to do the right thing, work with us and send the message that this minority Parliament can work together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060000">My other challenge is with the math from the NDP in this instance. Over five years, the distributional analysis suggests that for incomes over $97,000, the basic personal amount will be about $3.5 billion, yet the dental care promise in the NDP platform is $5 billion. These numbers do not add up and that is my fundamental challenge with this motion.</ParaText>

When I look at the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report, it says the benefits do go to those making above $90,000, just as the previous tax cut went to those making above $90,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060002">There is always a reason for the Liberals not to do the right thing, but when we see the costs of this figured out, it would probably cost $1.8 billion in the first year and then probably about $800 million. That may be low, but the impacts on society are going to be much better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060006">Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question. Rather than talking about the middle class, which I think has become so damaged, we have to start talking about the new working class, which is no longer only blue-collar but also white-collar workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060007">There are professors who are basically getting minimum wage and working on endless contracts.

              <ParaText id="6060008">Therefore, this myth that there is a middle class that we are all part of has become problematic. We have seen a deterioration of that class, and the new working class is no longer just a blue-collar situation. It is also people who are on these endless contract cycles and burdened with student debt. Once we start talking about the real relationship of class, I think we can start to talk about targeted solutions for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060015">I am very pleased to rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for <Affiliation DbId="252953" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>. I am glad to see that he took note of the new tax cut that the government gave middle-class Canadians. This tax cut will put more money in the pockets of nearly 20 million Canadians. It is a commitment we made during the last election campaign, when we promised to make life more affordable for Canadians. We made that promise and kept it, because we know that this tax cut will help middle-class families and those working hard to join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060016">First of all, I believe it is worth pointing out that Canada's economy is strong and growing. I would like to cite some statistics. More than 1.1 million jobs have been created since the fall of 2015. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in more than 40 years. Wages are rising faster than inflation. The poverty rate in Canada is at an all-time low. The results of the 2018 Canadian income survey show that between 2015 and 2018, more than one million Canadians were lifted out of poverty, including 334,000 children and 73,000 seniors. This is the largest three-year reduction in Canadian history. Canadian businesses are turning a profit. In fact, their profits are making them more competitive. This means that employers can continue to create more well-paying jobs. In the end, middle-class Canadians are the winners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060017">Nevertheless, there is more work to be done. The cost of living is increasing, and too many families still have a hard time making ends meet. That is why we want to help Canadians keep more of what they earn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060018">It is also why, in 2015, we gave Canadians the tax relief they deserved. We put hundreds of dollars in the pockets of middle-class Canadians. We also asked the richest 1% to pay a little more. In 2020, our government is more committed than ever to providing more support for the middle class and for the most vulnerable Canadians, achieving tax fairness and investing in people. That is the best way to grow the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060019">That is why we have taken steps to help families buy their first home. It is why we have enhanced support for Canadian families. As I mentioned yesterday, 9,000 families in Hochelaga have received monthly tax-free payments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060333">I would point out that the member for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> has presented different estimates as to the government's litigation costs related to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision respecting the first nations child and family services program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060334">The member presents three sets of information: the government's response to Question No. 163, which I would point out has been calculated using a consistent formula that the government uses for litigation costs in responding to Order Paper questions; a compilation of a number of responses to ATIP questions over the years, which has been compiled by Dr. Blackstock; and an estimate prepared by the Assembly of First Nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060335">The government does not have a clear line of sight into how either Dr. Blackstock or the AFN calculated these costs or what was included in their estimates. This in no way suggests that the calculations were done in bad faith or that the minister deliberately misled the House with the government's response to Question No. 163.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060336">This amounts to a debate as to the facts, and therefore should not be considered a legitimate question of privilege.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060339"> If that approach does not yield the results that a member expects, it is perfectly legitimate for members to raise these matters as points of order.

              <ParaText id="6060340"> I would hate to suggest that members are using these important questions of privilege simply to score political points. I would also like to point out that raising these matters as questions of privilege is tantamount to a direct personal attack on a member's character.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6060354">Mr. Speaker, I will pick up where I left off before question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060355">That is also why, as the first act in its new mandate, our government tabled a proposal to once again lower taxes for the middle class. All Canadians must be able to reap the benefits of our economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060356">This new tax cut targets the basic personal amount, as the government indicated this past December when it tabled a notice of ways and means motion. The basic personal amount is a technical term that is not always easy to understand but essentially describes something very simple: It is the amount of money that a person can earn before paying federal income tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060357">At this time of year, many Canadians are preparing to fill out their income tax return for 2019. When they do it, they will see that the basic personal amount for 2019 was $12,069. The plan we are proposing will raise that amount to $15,000 in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060358">Let me be clear. Canadians will see a difference beginning this year, in 2020, since this increase is spread over four years. Once these tax cuts are fully implemented in 2023, single people could save nearly $300 in taxes every year, and families could save double that, or nearly $600.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060359">That is not all. Nearly 1.1 million more Canadians will no longer pay federal income tax in 2023, including seniors living on a fixed income and low-income workers, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060360">Our proposal increases two other related amounts at the same time: the spouse or common law credit and the credit for an eligible dependant. Conversely, Canadians in the highest tax bracket will not get this tax cut. Nonetheless, this cut will put more money in the pockets of nearly 20 million Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060361">The Canada child benefit reduces the financial pressure on families and has lifted approximately 300,000 children out of poverty. As I said yesterday in my statement in the House, more than 9,000 payments were made in Hochelaga and more than 15,000 children benefited from these payments, which averaged $640. In total, $5,769,000 in tax-free payments were made in Hochelaga, and they have certainly helped families, including single-parent families. When I was a young mother, I would have loved to have access to that kind of funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060362">As the <Affiliation DbId="253372" Type="4">Minister of Social Development</Affiliation> said, Canada's poverty rate has fallen to a historic low. According to Statistics Canada, it was one of the sharpest declines on record: Canada's official poverty rate dropped from 12.1% in 2015 to 8.7% in 2018. The Minister of Social Development said that it was the largest three-year reduction in poverty in Canadian history and that poverty is at its lowest point on record in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060363">It is thanks to programs such as the Canada child benefit, as well as increases to the guaranteed income supplement, that Canadians have more money in their pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060364">I would like to use my remaining time to tell members about what the government has done to help Canadians, including the most vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060365">As I said, we created the Canada child benefit, which has lifted 300,000 children out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060366">The enhanced guaranteed income supplement means that some 900,000 seniors now enjoy greater income security. That lifted 57,000 seniors out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060367">Canada's national housing strategy, an investment of $40 million over 10 years, will enable more Canadians to find safe, affordable housing. The strategy will meet the needs of over half a million households over the next decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060368">The Canada workers benefit puts more money in the pockets of low-income workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060369">Thanks to the middle-class tax cut and the higher basic personal amount, a typical family of four will have over $2,300 more this year than in 2015. Once the changes have been fully implemented, that typical family could have $2,800 more than in 2015.</ParaText>

We are learning about the Liberals' middle-class tax cuts and all we are asking them to do is cap that at $90,000. That would save $1.6 billion to the Canadian taxpayer, which in turn could be used for a dental care plan that would help one in five Canadians who cannot access dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060374">The Liberals have a choice to provide a tax break to those who are making more than $90,000 a year or to offer dental care coverage to families making less than $90,000 a year. It is a simple choice, but this would make a huge difference in the lives of people from coast to coast to coast. It is good for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060391">Mr. Speaker, that was a great intervention that we heard from the Conservatives. I am really happy to pick up on it. Let us chat a little on that topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060392">It dovetails really nicely into an article that the Canadian Press put out today. It talks about Canada, according to Statistics Canada, having the lowest rate of poverty in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060393"> I have news for the member across the way: That has very little to do with the former Conservative universal child care benefit and a lot more to do with the Canada child benefit that was introduced by this government. As a matter of fact, members do not even have to take my word for it; we can listen to what all of the professionals are saying. Let us look at what Statistics Canada is talking about as it relates to how far we have come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060394">With regard to this specific motion, I actually do not have a big problem with the various components that are in the motion. What I have an issue with is the way in which it was presented. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060395">Do I look toward a day when we can have a meaningful discussion about dental care? I absolutely do. I always think that it was one of the natural next steps in health care, back when it was introduced back in the 1960s. It was in a minority Parliament situation, I will say, when we had the opportunity to discuss and bring forward that very important piece of legislation. Now we are talking about pharmacare, which was, in my opinion, the next natural step, although unfortunately, it took as long as it did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060396"> I do want to have a discussion and I am very happy to see that it is within the mandate of the minister to start having that discussion. Indeed, I am sure parliamentarians will, at the appropriate committee, want to talk about dental care and where that falls into this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060397">However, let us get back to the topic at hand and where this motion is really going. This motion is attempting to zero in on doing as much as we possibly can, in particular for those who are struggling to make it. I would argue that through a number of the pieces of legislation that the government has introduced over the last four and a half years, we have seen significant strides in terms of lifting people out of poverty and in terms of seeing the lowest recorded levels of unemployment in Canadian history. We are talking about the economy growing at a pace that leads among the G7 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060398">I heard a very interesting discussion between a Conservative member and an NDP member prior to question period, in which the Conservatives seemed to be asking why we are only talking about the middle class and why it is just the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060399">
                <B>An hon. member</B>: You do not even know what the middle class is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060400">
                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen</B>: Mr. Speaker, look at this. Through their heckling, they are asking the same question again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060401"> I am surprised that Conservatives do not understand the economic principle of supporting those who drive the economy forward. They are basically asking what is in it for the 1% and saying there is nothing in it for the 1%. Despite the fact that they tout themselves as the economic saviours of Canada, they do not realize that when a nation has a strong middle class, when we help people who are struggling to get out of those circumstances, we will see our economy grow, and who is going to benefit the most from a fast-growing economy? It is the 1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060402">
                <B>An hon. member</B>: Do we have one?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060403">
                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen</B>: Mr. Speaker, do we have one? I am happy to answer questions now if the member would like. Do we have one? We have one of the fastest-growing economies in the G7. We have the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. Do we have a fast-growing economy? This economy is among the best that we have seen. Notwithstanding the heckling that is coming from the other side of the House, I would beg to differ with my colleague who made that comment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060404">I will say that this is why something like amending the basic allowance for personal income before taxes is so key. It is because this takes it another step forward.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060405">This is to help those who are struggling to make it. It lets us give them a break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060406"> The numbers that we are talking about here would put $3 billion back into the pockets of Canadians in 2020 and up to $6 billion by 2023, which will affect 1.1 million more Canadians who would pay zero in federal income tax. What we are doing is putting money back into the pockets of Canadians. Some people who need it the most would be getting an additional $300 per year. Families would be saving, through the reduction in taxes, an additional $600 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060407">What are those people who are getting an extra $300 a year going to do? This is a rhetorical question to my colleague from British Columbia, but they are not going to put it in a tax-free savings account. They are not going to be putting it into an investment that does not help the economy work. They are going to be putting it right back into the economy by spending that money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060408">Who does better when people are spending money in the economy? The government does better. Guess what the government can do when they do better? They can start bringing in more policy like this to give more breaks, and that is what we are seeing.</ParaText>

                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060410">
                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really feel as though I am making progress here, because a Conservative member across the way is starting to get it. I really feel that this has been an effective discourse despite the fact that it has involved some heckling, some of it what we might consider to be unparliamentary. I am really happy to see this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060411">However, going back to the motion, what we know is that when we put the necessary tools in place to help grow our economy, to help people who are struggling, to help the middle class in particular, we are going to see meaningful changes to our economy that are going to be for the betterment of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060412">When we talk about dental care and where the NDP is trying to go with this opposition motion, I am fully supportive of the idea of looking into dental care and figuring out, as we have been with pharmacare, what the advantages would be in going toward a system like this. I applaud the NDP for always being the champions of issues like this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060413">I am willing to be quite frank here. It was the NDP, the former CCF, and Tommy Douglas who led the charge on health care. We would not have the amazing health care system we have in this country right now had it not been for that member, and I stand by that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060414">This is not a partisan thing; it is the reality of the situation. I applaud the NDP for always pushing forward on this agenda. What I have an issue with in this particular motion is the way that the motion is construed to try to tie these two together. In all honesty, I think it does a disservice to the work that needs to be done to properly examine where we need to go with dental care and the impacts that some of these policies genuinely have on Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060415">I will leave it at that. I look forward to answering any questions. I am happy to engage on a personal level with some of the Conservative members if they would like to learn a little more from me. I am always willing to share my wisdom.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060416">Mr. Speaker, it is difficult, because the Liberals are talking about how great the economy is for many people in our country, while of course the Conservatives are arguing about how much better they are at managing the economy.

This time, if someone earns $143,000, that person will get the maximum. </ParaText>

I even looked up a headline from the CBC at the time that said, Liberal apologizes for saying that people will take their child care money and spend it on beer and popcorn.

Here is the kicker to it. What Conservatives do not understand about it is that they might get a short-term gain, because they can give $1,500 a year to some members of their base, but they are not doing anything in the long term for the economy.</ParaText>

We heard in caucus stories from across the country of people who would like to get a job but in some cases are ashamed to go to an interview. In other cases, they feel that they were not selected because of the stigma I referred to earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060435"> There is often objection to embarking on this kind of project to do something concrete for people. The objection is not to having the government do things for people they cannot otherwise do themselves, but to having government be a vehicle for collective action to help people who on their own do not have a big voice. This is unlike some of the big corporations we see here that get to be the hot topic of question period because they have a lot of money and they have the ability to invest. Most regular Canadians do not get that kind of time and attention. The purpose of this motion today is to get that time and attention and to provide that kind of advocacy for regular Canadians who are struggling just to look after their teeth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060436">That is the choice that NDP members are bringing forward to the House today. Often the objection is that, although it is a nice thing to do and NDP members are nice people, we do not understand what it costs. We do not understand how it will get done and the government cannot afford to do that for everybody. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060437">For the benefit of those who might be listening at home, I would like to read the motion into the record, which will not be the first time today I am sure. The way the motion reads is exactly to show that we can afford this, because it would be using money the government has already made a choice to do something with, which is to give a tax break that is going to disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060438">The motion reads:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call on the government to change its proposed tax cuts by targeting benefits to those who earn less than $90,000 per year, and use those savings to invest in priorities that give real help to Canadians, including dental coverage for uninsured families making less than $90,000 per year.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060440">It is a down payment on getting to universal coverage with money that is already there and that the government has already told us that it does not need because it is prepared to put it back in people's pockets. Whose pockets will it go into? Overwhelmingly, the money for this cut tax would go back into the pockets of people who earn over $100,000 a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060441">The largest benefit that an individual Canadian can get under this cut would be in the neighbourhood of $300 a year, which is not that much. The people for whom $300 a year is a lot are not going to be getting $300. Instead of giving $300 per year to people who are already making at least $113,000 a year, we can ensure that families with the least income in Canada are getting access to a service they do not have access to right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060442">Earlier in the House, our leader made reference to the long lineups at free university dental clinics. I think Montreal was the example he used, but it is not unique to Montreal and it is happening across the country. People cannot get access to those services.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060443">It is just not true that we cannot afford to do this. The people who say we cannot afford to invest in our people, we cannot afford to make sure that people have the services they need, together those two parties have been ruling this country for a long time, in fact for the entire history of our country, but particularly in the last 30 years. We have seen massive government deregulation. We have seen massive cuts to social spending by the federal government, starting in the nineties. We have taken that path of deregulation and cutting services and refusing to invest in people. That is the trajectory we have been on for 30 years now and it has not been working. Canadians more and more feel pressure to make ends meet at the end of the month. They feel like they are not getting the same level of service that they used to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060444">We heard questions in question period today about people calling the Canada Revenue Agency and not being able to reach anyone on the phone. We cannot go into an office to get help to apply for EI or to figure out how to file our taxes. The services that the federal government has been providing have been in steady decline, all in the name of increased prosperity that just has not come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060445"> There is a lot of evidence that shows that when we invest in people and help them get the things they need in order to get back on their feet, like looking after their teeth so that they have the confidence they need to go to a job interview and get that job, or so that in retirement they do not isolate themselves in their apartments because they feel awkward about going out, worrying that people might be laughing at them, or that they will not be understood because their teeth are not what they used to be. It really is no laughing matter. People worry about that and it ends up seriously affecting their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060446">We have had the approach of cutting. We have had the approach of helping out big corporations, giving them massive corporate tax breaks in the hope they will invest back in the economy, which they did not do, and that the wealth would trickle down. That whole way of thinking has been debunked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060447">Instead of giving another tax break to people who are making over six figures, we should take that money and invest it in something that is going to do something for people who could use the help. They need a government that is willing to coordinate those many voices. They are far more numerous than the people earning the most, but those voices are not loud because they do not have the money to amplify them. They need a government that is willing to coordinate that activity so that for all of those people, who are the majority, they can start getting the things that they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060448">That is what the NDP is committed to advocate for in this place. We make no apologies about it. We are going to continue to make proposals. We are not just here to criticize. There is certainly a lot to criticize and we will not hesitate to do that either. A part of real criticism, that is not just part of the cheap political point-scoring that too often goes on in this place, is to come up with real proposals and real alternatives about how we would do it differently. This is how we would do it differently, but it does not have to be just our idea. We would prefer that it not be just our idea, but that parties in this place get on board. The money is there. We can make it work and it is about time that we did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060449">That is what we are here today to do. That is what we are here today to say. I do not think we need to send it off to committee to study and study. Here is the deal. The Liberals promised pharmacare in 1997. We know what “to study it” means. It is kicking the can down the road so the job does not get done at the end of the day. Liberals said they liked the idea of a parliamentary committee study at one point, then they created their own commission for pharmacare. The fact is we are not missing the information, we are missing the political will. No amount of studying will stand in for political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060450">The motion today does not make a change in the budget. It calls on the House to affirm that change. Surely with the resources of government, if we have the political will, we can get this done and get it done quickly. That is what we are calling on the House to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060452">The second part of the motion I have a problem with. We are running a $26.6-billion deficit. I am going to refer to some words from Roy Romanow and Tommy Douglas, who said that when governments are in debt, they are actually not making policy decisions anymore on behalf of their people. They are making policy decisions on behalf of the people they owe the money to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060453">What I see by running up large successive deficits and accumulating more debt, which the first part of the motion could easily deal with, is a policy of letting bankers decide for us what we should be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060454">Is that a wise way of doing it? I am guessing Roy Romanow would not agree with it.

              <ParaText id="6060455">Mr. Speaker, what is left out of that analysis is the importance of revenue in balancing a budget. The corporate tax rate went from 28% in the year 2000 to just 15% today. Every point of the corporate tax rate is worth over $2 billion, and he talks about the magnitude of deficit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060456">The fact is that the Conservatives and Liberals both got there together. That decrease in taxes started under Chrétien and Paul Martin and it was finalized by Stephen Harper. The story was that private industry would take those tens of billions of dollars and invest them in the Canadian economy. That did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060457"> The promise of what those tax cuts were meant to do was never realized. The fact is that money could be better spent. There is no way that we will ever balance a budget if we do not raise enough revenue.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6060458">Mr. Speaker, the member overstated it when he said that these benefits would flow to families or individuals earning over $100,000. According to the PBO and its distributional analysis, looking at 2024 when there is a total expenditure of $6.8 billion, 86% of that will go to individuals earning under $97,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060459"> I do not want to completely understate the amount of money at issue here, though. It will be over $900 million that will flow to individuals with incomes over $97,000, so there money potentially to be saved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060460">I have a question, though, with respect to the expense on dental care. If we look at the math over the five years and if we were to cap it at $97,000, we would see $3.5 billion in savings. However, if we look at the NDP's promise and the costing from the PBO, it would be $4.9 billion in expenditure. Therefore, the math does not add up. What are the member's comments on that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060461">Mr. Speaker, the cap we are proposing is at $90,000, not at $97,000, so there is a little extra revenue to be made up there. It is weighted to the first year, in part because there is a big backlog. However, the member will notice that the ongoing operating cost of that program goes down significantly in year two and thereafter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060462">Again, this is not a question of money; this is a question of political will. The math is there to make this work. If it is the question of a small additional investment at the outset in order to get it up and going, that is quite reasonable. If the House wants it and if the government wants it, surely we can get it done. We have money for Mastercard and Loblaws. That is the kind of money we are talking about to make up for the small difference that the member mentioned.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6060468">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise to speak to our motion with respect to dental care. It is amazing what I have seen over the years. There is always an excuse not to help children with health care and people who need some type of assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060469">At the end of the day, this is a matter of political will. We can listen to all the different excuses such as not enough money being there, but there is money for the submarines that do not work right. There is money for planes that have not been delivered, and with overrun costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060470">I will give a classic example of something that just came to its anniversary. The money we borrowed for a new tax on Canadians. The HST was brought in and we gave money to the Provinces of British Columbia and Ontario to enter into the program. We had the economic analysis on the cost of borrowing over 10 years. Ontario received $4.6 billion and British Columbia received $1.6 billion to British Columbia. It is now over $7.1 billion in cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060471">When we are talking about the dental care for Canadians, we are also talking about the savings we would have for so many people who do not have the necessary coverage. We are also talking about the improvement in our economy by having a healthier workforce. Those are not immeasurable in the economics being applied here today, but they are tangible at the end of the day for the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060472">There is no doubt that when looking at dental care, it is one of the most underestimated investments when it comes to health care. There are several factors that help people with their dental care. It is not even just about cleaning and an avoidance of pain. We also deal with other health problems, such as respiratory conditions, cardiovascular disease, dementia, infections, diabetic complications, renal disease complications, premature birth and low birth weight. These are all related to poor dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060473">We can always find an excuse not to start something and the motion speaks to that. It is specifically about making a budgetary choice in this Parliament. It is very much isolated to the moment with respect to economics and its accountability for the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060474">We are asking the House to call on the government to change its proposed tax cuts by targeting benefits to those who earn less than $90,000 per year and use those savings to invest in priorities that give real help to Canadians, including dental coverage for uninsured families making less than $90,000 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060475">Millions of Canadians will now be able to afford some type of basic dental coverage. When we did the work in the partnership and outreach for this motion, statistics indicated that 35.4% of Canadians reported that they had no dental insurance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060476">There are people in our neighbourhoods who are unable to get coverage. A significant portion of the population do not have any insurance whatsoever. What money they use on oral hygiene and health care is at the expense of rent, food or investment in education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060477">It is important to note that those people are also most likely to be under-employed, unemployed or work part-time. It is so hard for this chamber to wrap itself around the fact that we want a simple choice to start a significant program that would at least touch the worst of the worst in Canada. It is amazing we can always find a reason not to do it, but we can find a reason to buy a pipeline and buy submarines that do not work right. We can find all kinds of reasons for pet projects and corporations, including Mastercard and Loblaws. We always hear the explanation of why it is possible and why it has to be done.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060478">However, when it comes to protecting kids, when it comes to providing a basic coverage for them and their families that are the worst off, there is always a reason not to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060479">This is what is disappointing. With all the problems we face right now in the country, one of the most civilized countries on the planet, we cannot help some of the people in our constituencies when it comes to oral hygiene and dental problems. Is it too big of a problem for us to fix? Is it that we cannot do it and we will have to leave it up to another Parliament? Maybe it will find the wisdom. Can we not find the small amount of money in the budget to reallocate toward this proposal?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060480"> I talked about the HST and the continued legacy of debt and deficit. We continue to finance that deficit to bring a tax on ourselves. What I have not said is that we are still not in a surplus. We are still paying interest on that debt. There was no problem finding the money for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060481">However, to pay for this, there is a problem. I do not understand it. I think most Canadians are on board with this. I think most Canadians understand the vulnerabilities. When we look at the numbers, it also affects women. For a government that says it is dealing with some of the systemic problems in relation to women and society, again, this is another missed opportunity. The statistics show that 24.1% of women are more likely than men, 20%, to report costs as a barrier. People are saying they are not taking care of themselves because of that. It is an issue of finance. Canadians aged 18 to 34, 28%, were the age group most likely to report costs as a barrier for dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060482">We are at a time when we have burdened our youth with expenses from post-secondary education that are historic. We are passing on a legacy of debt to them, as well as a legacy of other issues for them to deal with. They also have some of the highest rates of unemployment and under-employment. There is also the fact that many of the jobs they enter into do not have benefit packages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060483">We are saying that we give up, that we cannot do it, that it is too complicated for us and that we cannot figure it out. There is no consensus here. Nobody else can offer an amendment? There could have been an amendment to this to make it work. That is fine. We are open to that. An amendment could have happened here. However, the government is saying no, that it cannot do that, that it is too complicated and too hard. The government just cannot be bothered and that is sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060484">Those young people are our future. One would think we would have the common sense to actually be preventative. One of the reasons we talk about this in a prevention model is that there is also another $155 million approximately for people to go to hospital emergency rooms to have their teeth taken care of. However, we do not know the true costs because people do not even do it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060485">I do not know a Canadian out there right now who would not like to have an emergency room that is not cluttered with mental health issues and other types of unnecessary appointments. People have to go to emergency rooms because they are desperate and have nowhere else to go. I do not know anyone out there who would not agree that these cases do not need to be there when there are other emergencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060486">That would be one of the better things that could streamline our system. How much money are we losing and tying up because people cannot get the proper basic coverage for their dental care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060487">For many mental health issues, we do not provide actual supports out there. People end up going to the hospital because they have no other options or they go to a clinic, if they are really desperate. We pay for that. That does not make any sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060488">Again, I would argue the economic value of this for employers who are looking to invest in Canada. This is significant because it takes this off their books and puts it toward a workforce that is healthy, stronger, more competitive and productive. That is good for all Canadians, because those people then pay taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060492">If people are going to emergency rooms out of desperation at 10 o'clock at night because they have to be at work the next day, then there is less flow in our economy because productivity goes down for a lot of different reasons related to that. With prevention, an appointment is scheduled and people never end up in that situation and do not become a burden on the emergency health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060493">That is one perfect example of how this would work and how the investment would pay off. It should be measured as part of the formula to do this. We should at least provide some political will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060494">Everybody knows that hospital wait times are very difficult, very stressful and very painful. Canadians should be asking their MPs why we are sending those with dental problems to the hospital, as opposed to what we should be doing, which is helping them to prevent those problems to begin with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060504">Mr. Speaker, first of all, this is a motion; it is not legislation. It is important to distinguish between the two. The motion provides the vehicle and flexibility to do that. It would not trample on provincial rights. It provides a direct policy for the government to change where the funding comes from with regard to high-income earners and allows for a system to be put in place. From there, it is up to the government to craft the way it wants to do it, which is similar to how we deliver health care to all the provinces. The motion does not specifically assign this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060507">With respect to the suggestion on how savings from changes to the tax system could be used, I am pleased to talk about the government's commitment to strengthen health care for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060508">The mandate letter of the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> includes a commitment to support Parliament in studying the issue of dental care so that we can better understand what the government's role may be in helping to improve access to dental care in Canada. This debate provides an opportunity for members of Parliament to share their views on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060509">Across the country, many Canadians have coverage for dental care through private employee health benefit plans, while many are supported by government programs. According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, $15.5 billion was spent on dental services in Canada in 2017. Of this, 54% was covered through private insurance plans, 40% was paid out of pocket and 6% was publicly funded by a variety of federal, provincial and territorial government programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060510"> We know that oral health is an integral element of overall health. By the time they are adults, 96% of Canadians have been impacted by dental decay. It is largely preventable and disproportionately and more severely impacts our most vulnerable populations, such as those living with a disability, those from low-income households, those in marginalized communities and seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060511">Twenty per cent of Canadians have moderate to severe gum disease. This number is amplified in older adults and those with lower incomes. Not only can this cause tooth loss and related problems with eating, speaking and social interactions, it has been shown to complicate a number of medical conditions. Further, the Canadian Cancer Society advises that in overall cancer incidents in Canada, oral cancer ranks ninth in men and 13th in women, and the trend line is increasing. About 5,300 Canadians will be diagnosed with oral cancer annually, and nearly 1,500 will die of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060512">That is why the government welcomed the Standing Committee on Health's recent decision to study the issue of dental care in Canada and stands ready to support the committee in its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060513">At a national level in Canada, good data on unmet dental care needs does not exist. We know that three-quarters of Canadians visit a dentist at least once a year, higher than the OECD average, and that wait times for dental care are among the shortest in the world. Approximately two-thirds of Canadians report no dental needs. At the same time, we know that approximately one-third of Canadians are uninsured and that approximately six million Canadians have reported avoiding a visit to the dentist because of cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060514">To address data gaps, the Canadian government has partnered with Statistics Canada to design an oral health surveillance component for an upcoming cycle of a Canadian health measure survey, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and in collaboration with leading researchers from all 10 of Canada's university faculties of dentistry and experts from the United States and the United Kingdom. This work will provide key information for those developing oral health programs and policies for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060515">In addition to improving data on dental care, the federal government provides dental care services for certain groups of people through the non-insured health benefits program delivered by Indigenous Services Canada. The government provides dental coverage for recognized first nations and Inuit. In addition, the children's oral health initiative provides dental coverage for many first nations children and their parents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060516">Through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the interim federal health program provides coverage for emergency dental care services for some refugee claimants and protected persons. In addition, the federal government provides members of the Canadian Armed Forces, some veterans and inmates of federal penitentiaries with dental coverage.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060517">Alongside these federal programs, all provinces and territories fund and manage their own dental care services, which cover medically necessary in-hospital dental services for all residents. Many provincial and territorial programs also cover some dental services for certain groups of people, such as children in low-income households, people receiving social assistance benefits, people with certain disabilities and senior citizens. However, specific eligibility requirements, types of services included and the financial coverage levels depend on the province or the territory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060518">Provincial and territorial health care programs, including those with dental coverage, are supported by federal funding through the Canada health transfer, or the CHT. The CHT is providing $40.4 billion to the provinces and territories in 2019-20. This will continue to increase each year in line with the growth rate of the economy, with a minimum increase of at least 3% per year. Over the next five years, CHT funding to provinces and territories is expected to exceed $200 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060519">In addition to direct federal spending on dental services and fiscal transfers to the provinces and territories, assistance for dental care is already provided through the federal tax system. About two-thirds of Canadians receive dental coverage from their employee health insurance benefits. The federal government supports these Canadians by not including the value of these insurance plans in the taxable income of employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060520">Forty per cent of dental care costs are paid through out-of-pocket payments by Canadians. The federal government provides assistance with these costs through an income tax credit called the medical expenses tax credit. This is a non-refundable tax credit for eligible medical expenses that can be claimed by taxpayers if the expenses exceed 3% of an individual's net income or $2,352, whichever is less, in the 2019 tax year. An additional refundable medical expense supplement is available for working individuals with low incomes and high medical expenses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060521">In addition to support for dental care, the federal government improves the oral health of Canadians at the national level through health promotion, disease prevention and professional and technical guidance. In the area of health promotion, and in consultation with the national oral health professional community, last year the government incorporated oral health considerations into the Canada food guide and into its ongoing information campaigns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060522">In terms of prevention, the government has worked with the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Alberta to produce user-friendly online information on proper teeth cleaning for infants, children, adults, seniors and pregnant women, as well as for caregivers supporting older adults living with dementia at home. The government has also partnered with the University of Manitoba and collaborated with many key national health professional organizations to produce the Canadian caries risk assessment tool, which will now enable Canadian health practitioners to confidently assess their preschool patients and take the steps necessary to prevent early childhood caries and guide those patients into the appropriate care approaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060523">The government has also worked with the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health to produce comprehensive knowledge products for community decision-makers on water fluoridation. Community water fluoridation remains a safe, cost-effective and equitable public health practice to prevent tooth decay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060524">In the areas of professional and technical guidance, the government collaborated with leading Canadian researchers in the areas of the oral health effects of cannabis and vaping to develop knowledge products for Canadian oral health practitioners to consider as they care for their patients who may be using these substances. The government has also partnered with McGill University to create and launch the Canadian Dental Connection website for rural and remote communities seeking oral health practitioners, and provide online training modules for these practitioners on cultural competency and trauma-informed care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060525">To support the improvement of the oral health of Canadians and fulfill our international responsibilities, the government works with partners and stakeholders nationally and globally, including organizations in the professional, regulatory and educational domains, such as the Canadian Dental Association and the Canadian Dental Regulatory Authorities Federation. We have also collaborated with international health and dental organizations, such as the World Health Organization, and oral health authorities around the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060526">These initiatives demonstrate that our government is playing a constructive role in supporting access to dental care for Canadians. We look forward to participating in the study of dental care to be conducted by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health, of which I am proud to say I am member. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060527">However, we know that dental care is only one aspect of the health care system for Canadians. The government has a strong interest in improving the health care system so that it can meet the needs of Canadians now and into the future. With an aging population, increasing rates of chronic disease and cost pressures tied to new drugs and technologies, our system must adapt if it is to deliver better care and better outcomes at a cost that is affordable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060528">Our government is committed to strengthening health care, including improving access to primary care, mental health services, home and palliative care, and implementing national universal pharmacare for Canadians. These commitments build on our actions over the last several years to improve access to mental health services, home and palliative care, and prescription drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060529"> Our joint work with provinces and territories has been particularly successful and provides a good model for future joint work on health care. Federal, provincial and territorial governments reached an agreement on a common statement of principles for shared health priorities in 2017, which outlines key priorities for federal investments in mental health and addictions, as well as home and community care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060530">The common statement reaffirms our shared commitment to report on results to Canadians through common indicators; to improve the affordability, accessibility and appropriate use of prescription drugs; to support health innovation; and to engage with regional and national indigenous leaders on their priorities for improving the health outcomes of indigenous peoples. Under this agreement, federal investments of $11 billion over 10 years are being used by provinces and territories to address specific needs in our health care system, such as increasing the availability of home and palliative care and helping youth access needed mental health services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060531">We will continue to build on this progress as we work to implement the commitments outlined in the mandate letter of the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, including improving access to primary care, setting national standards for access to mental health services, and continuing to make home and palliative care more available across the country.

In addition to the Canada child benefit, which has done incredible things for our country, one of the things I am most proud of is the $11 billion, in addition to the health care accord, that we have put in separate streams to go toward mental health care and home care. This investment allows the federal government to have a say in how that money is spent, and it comes with expectations on behalf of the provinces and territories to ensure those funds are spent in the proper way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060553">Mr. Speaker, it is fascinating to listen to my colleague talk about federal-provincial collaboration on health matters. I do not know why we are debating this topic today, since health is a provincial jurisdiction. This motion is rather odd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060554">That said, my colleague talks a lot about federal health spending. We do want to work together, even though this is a provincial jurisdiction, but federal legislation stipulates that the government pays 50% of provincial health care costs. Right now, Quebec is getting just 22% and we are asking for a 6% increase. We are far from that 50%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060555">Is my colleague prepared to look at increasing health transfers to Quebec so that we can perhaps participate in a Canada-wide pharmacare program?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060564">Today we are here to talk about something incredibly important, and that is dental care. We know that, across Canada, many Canadians are not able to afford basic dental care. I want to read into the record so that the constituents of North Island—Powell River know what we are talking about. The motion that the NDP has presented today simply says:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the House call on the government to change its proposed tax cuts by targeting benefits to those who earn less than $90,000 per year, and use those savings to invest in priorities that give real help to Canadians, including dental coverage for uninsured families making less than $90,000 per year.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060566">In my riding this is a significant challenge. During the election I was very surprised by how many doors I knocked on where people told me very clearly that affordable dental care was one of the best parts of the NDP platform to help people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060567">In my riding there are challenges on this issue. I want to give a specific shout-out to Compass Dental in Campbell River. One day a year, usually on a Saturday or a weekend day, dentists from that office, from Shoreline Orthodontics and Pier Street Dental come together and provide free dental care to members of the community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060568">There may be other dentists added to this list. When I went there a couple of years ago, the reception staff were absolutely amazing. They told me when they arrived early in the morning there was a huge lineup of people outside the door hoping to get an opportunity. Those dentists work hard every moment of that day to provide the dental care that people so desperately need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060569">I am so grateful for that dedication and that commitment in the riding, but I also face the reality that many people are desperately in need of dental care and have no way of being able to afford it. I cannot imagine how hard it is for dentists to have to turn people away, but that is what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060570">I remember talking with a mother who talked about the reality that, at the end of the year, she pays for her children to get their dental care, but she simply cannot afford her own dental care. All parents would sacrifice for their children, but it is not right that the costs are such a barrier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060571">I also think of one constituent who is 56 years old and has had six teeth pulled in the last 10 years. She is down now to one chewing tooth. I cannot imagine that. Looking into the future, she knows that she needs implants or dentures, but she does not know how she is going to afford them. Her plan is to blend her food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060572"> How is it that, in a country as rich as this, we are seeing the government give significant amounts of money to Mastercard and Loblaws, profitable businesses that are doing quite well for themselves, rather than to people who want to have their teeth taken care of? It is a simple, basic need. As rich as we are in Canada, we should do better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060573">That is why we are here today. In December, our finance and health spokesperson for the NDP wrote a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> saying this is a real opportunity to collaborate and work together. We asked the Liberals to cap the middle-class tax cut they are proposing for people earning over $90,000 and use that money as a down payment to cover uninsured people making less than $90,000 a year, which is about four million people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060574">As I am having this discussion about the need of individuals in our country for the most basic dental care it brings to mind the truth of this place, which is that financial choices are political choices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060575">Who are we going to support in this country? Are we going to support people who are making a significant profit at the end of the year?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060576">I remember when the government gave significant dollars to Loblaws in the last Parliament to help it with more energy-efficient refrigerators. I will never forget one of the local business owners in my riding emailing my office and asking where his money was for his refrigerator. A small amount of money would make such a significant difference in the life and prosperity of his business, and he wanted to know where he could get that kind of support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060577">I represent a rural and remote community, so there are other challenges on top of the challenges faced by people who have lower incomes or very expensive dental care. People could be making decent wages and keeping everything pretty sustainable, but if they need to have a very expensive dental procedure done sometimes they simply cannot do that. When we look at the challenges of just moving around my riding already, this just adds another layer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060578">When we look at these issues, we have to say to the government that when it makes choices about how to spend money, it is also making a political decision about who it values in this country. I hope all government members will support this motion, because what it really speaks to is valuing the most vulnerable people in our country and providing them with support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060579">There are so many stories, and I heard them when I was knocking on thousands of doors. I heard stories of people who were embarrassed to apply for work because their teeth were not in good shape. I heard stories of people who needed basic dental care, and it was getting to the point where it was painful so they were going to the hospital to get a tooth removed rather than getting care when they needed it, which could provide huge health concerns for them later in life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060580">I am really aware of the fact that in the year 2000 in this country we honoured corporate contributions. We understood that corporations in Canada, big multinational, multi-million-dollar corporations, were making a significant amount of money and doing it on the resources of this country and on the labour of the people who live in this country. The corporate tax at that point was 28%. Today that tax is down to 15%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060581">These huge corporations are making significant amounts of money. I want to be really clear: I am not talking about the corporations in my riding that are doing well and looking after their people. I am talking about big multinational corporations such as Mastercard and Loblaws that have significant revenues every year. There was a time when they paid that 28% tax. Basically, to me that was understanding that the resources belonged to Canadians in this country, that the labour came from people who lived in this country and that the corporate tax meant we would not have people suffering to such a high degree when other people were prospering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060582">Here we are today having this debate. We are asking the Liberal government to take this seriously. Like pharmacare in the last Parliament, and it is continuing in this Parliament as well, the government keeps pushing things down the road. It wants to do another study and not talk about the core issues here. When people are struggling to afford their medication they should be the priority, not big corporations. When people cannot afford the most basic dental care they should be the priority, not the rich and well-connected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060583">This is a choice, and I am really sad to see a lot of people who are speaking from the government side not seeing a pathway to get to this motion. I just want to be really clear to the constituents I represent that this is a motion in the House. There was another motion that was passed unanimously in the House a little over a year ago to make sure that if any money to be given to our veterans was left over at the end of a year, it would go into the next year to support them, because we know there are so many challenges and barriers. The government did not follow through on that motion. It made a choice to vote but not support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060584">Here we are again with an important motion that says we value people who have less. We value them more than people who have a lot, and today we are going to make sure they get the dental care they so desperately need.</ParaText>

If I look back over the past four years, our government has done extensive work to move this file forward. We have taken steps, including making changes to the pan-Canadian pharmaceutical review board. We have also joined provinces and territories to make sure that we can bulk-purchase medications together. Furthermore, in budget 2019, we invested $35 million for the creation of the Canadian drug agency. Work is under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060587">I have a specific question for my colleague. Does she agree that putting together a national pharmacare program, and also a dental care program, is going to require the collaboration of the provinces and territories?

              <ParaText id="6060593">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague a specific question around rural and remote communities that might face additional challenges with people who cannot plan for appropriate dental care and who then run into emergencies. How difficult it is for them to deal with that when they may not have a clinic or an emergency room available to them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060594">I spoke earlier in this chamber about the waste of $155 million for people having to go to emergency rooms for emergency dental care, and how it was completely wasteful. However, when we look at rural and remote communities, there are probably additional challenges for people to even get to those locations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060595">I would like to hear the member's comments about that.

              <ParaText id="6060597">I have to say, as a member of Parliament who represents more rural and remote communities, one of the biggest challenges is making sure that, when we look at our legislation and look at our actions, we are actually thinking of the realities on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060598">In my riding, which is basically half of Vancouver Island and a large part of the mainland as well, there are communities like Kingcome right now that are under evacuation because the water is not clean. It is an indigenous community. They have had to be emergency evacuated. The reality for them is to buy a couple of boats or take a helicopter to get out of that community. If someone there needs emergency dental care, the barriers are profound.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060599">I think about some of the communities that are accessible only by boat. It can take a long ferry ride to get to the services people need. These are the challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060600">When I look at motions like this, it is about making sure that people in our country who have the least have the most access, and that it is easy and affordable for them. There are other challenges that they face in our country. Across the whole country there are a lot of rural and remote communities. We need to make it more accessible for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060603">Canadians are justly proud of our public health care system. It is an accomplishment that defines us as a nation. It is an affirmation that we will take care of each other and our most vulnerable. It is a reflection of our commitment to equality and justice. However, it is not perfect and it is not complete. Many important health services remain uncovered in Canada. For these, patients remain at the mercy of their ability to pay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060604">Canada's New Democrats are proud to introduce the motion before us today because it would help address one of the most glaring gaps in our public system: dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060605">Our proposal calls on the Liberal government to target its tax plan currently before the House to those earning less than $90,000 per year and use those savings to make a down payment on universal dental care by immediately extending coverage to millions of currently uninsured Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060606">To be clear, Canadians earning over $90,000 a year do not need a tax cut, but those earning less do need help, and the NDP plan is based on this position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060607">The omission of dental coverage from our universal health care system is both a pressing public health concern and a social justice issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060608">Many would be surprised to learn that the most common non-communicable diseases are oral diseases. Studies have also linked poor dental health to serious health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, respiratory infections, diabetic complications, renal disease complications, premature birth and low birth rate. Numbers cannot begin to quantify the pain, social impacts, and economic losses suffered by those with untreated dental problems, yet as we speak, 35.4% of Canadians today have no dental insurance, and nearly seven million Canadians avoid the dentist every year because of the cost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060609">Unsurprisingly, this hurts poor and marginalized Canadians the most. Canada's most vulnerable citizens have the highest rates of dental decay and disease but the worst access to this much-needed service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060610">According to the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, 50% of low-income Canadians have no dental coverage whatsoever, along with the majority of seniors over the age of 60. Indigenous populations have nearly twice as much dental disease as non-indigenous Canadians, and income-related inequalities in oral health are greater in women than in men.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060611">Moreover, at a time when wages have flatlined and their job prospects have grown increasingly insecure, young people have also seen benefits like dental insurance rapidly scaled back or completely eliminated by employers. Today only 50% of millennials have access to dental insurance. This deficiency harms career prospects and is a matter of fundamental intergenerational inequity. According to Statistics Canada, young Canadians aged 18 to 34 are the most likely group to report cost as a barrier to dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060612"> If we can agree that everyone in Canada should have equal access to health care regardless of their age, income, job status or where they live, then we simply cannot justify the continued exclusion of oral health care from our public health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060613">However, at present, Canada ranks second-last in public financing for dental care among OECD countries. The motion before us today would begin to change that. By making a small modification to the government's tax plan, we can extend dental coverage to 4.3 million uninsured Canadians right away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060614">I will now provide a brief overview of how we can get this done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060615">In December 2019, the Liberal government announced its intention to increase the basic personal amount tax credit in 2020. It has marketed this proposal as a “middle-class tax cut”. However, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, individuals with net incomes between $103,000 to $160,000 will receive the largest average reduction in their income taxes at $347 annually, while individuals with net incomes below $15,000, the poorest Canadians, will receive the smallest average reduction, at $1.00.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060616">Overall, this tax plan will cost $6.9 billion per year once it is fully implemented. New Democrats believe that this funding should be focused on Canadians who are struggling to make ends meet. We are proposing that the government target this tax plan to those making $90,000 per year or less, with a phase-out beginning at $80,000, and use the $1.6 billion in annual savings to invest in dental care for uninsured Canadians with household incomes below $90,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060617">According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, providing dental coverage for uninsured families making less than $90,000, which is the median income in Canada, meaning 50% of Canadians in this country, would cost $1.8 billion in the first year and approximately $830 million for every year after that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060618">This program would give immediate help to 4.3 million people and save our health care system tens of millions of dollars every year. After all, emergency room visits due to dental emergencies already cost taxpayers at least $155 million annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060619">Under the NDP's plan, there would be no cost for individuals with a household income under $70,000, while copayments would be required on a sliding scale for those with a household income between $70,000 and $90,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060620">We are proposing comprehensive care for these Canadians. The minimum basket of services covered would include diagnostic services, preventive services, restorative services, endodontic services, periodontal services, prosthodontic services, oral surgery, orthodontic services and adjunctive services as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060621">This program would be the next big expansion in our health care system after pharmacare, which the NDP is also driving forward in this Parliament. This program could be administered by the federal government or by provinces and territories upon agreement. Existing provincial and territorial programs that provide the same services could continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060622">I wish to conclude my remarks today by outlining the path forward toward full universal dental care in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060623">During the last election, New Democrats heard from many Canadians who were struggling to afford necessary dental care. We heard heart-rending stories from Canadians in every province and territory of the physical, emotional, social and economic pain of dental illness. That is why at their first meeting following the campaign, the leader of the NDP pressed the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to work across party lines in this minority Parliament to address this urgent health concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060624">It is ludicrous that we cover the entire body and then carve out the piece of our mouth and cover it from the tonsils back, but leave Canadians uninsured for the tonsils forward. It is absurd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060625">I was pleased to see the government acknowledge this NDP priority in its Speech from the Throne and I was heartened that the <Affiliation DbId="253395" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>'s mandate letter contained a direction to “Work with Parliament to study and analyze the possibility of national dental care.” The NDP is turning a possibility into reality with the motion here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060626">I moved the motion at the Standing Committee on Health at the very first committee meeting dealing with business. I was proud that my colleagues accepted my motion to undertake that study on the development of a national dental care program and I call on my colleagues on the health committee to give this study the upmost priority, but as we prepare to embark on the tremendously important task of developing a national dental care program for Canadians, there is no reason we cannot get started right away, because the need is clear and before us we have a realistic plan to achieve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060627">I want to pause for a moment and remind my fellow Parliamentarians why we do not have dental care today. The 1964 Royal Commission on Health Services, which formed the original framework of our public health care system, called for the inclusion of dental services. That was always intended to be part of our public health care system. However, it was not brought in at that time simply because there was a shortage of dentists, a shortage so acute that they believed it was impossible to implement a universal system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060628">Nevertheless, the commission stated explicitly that it believed that it was imperative for the government to immediately establish a public system for children, expectant mothers and public assistance recipients that could be scaled up, as resources expanded, to a universal system. In fact, it said the program was one of the highest priorities among their proposals. Unfortunately, it was never established by any Liberal or Conservative government to this day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060629">However, today we have turned Canada's dentist shortage into a surplus, and thereby resolved the original impediment to implementing universal dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060630">It is time to roll up our sleeves and begin the work necessary to make this overdue health care service a reality for Canadians. I therefore call on all members to take that first step today. Let us demonstrate our commitment to universal dental care by making a down payment that immediately extends coverage to 4.3 million people, and then we will do the work to make sure every Canadian gets access to necessary dental care on a universal basis, as was originally intended over 50 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060631">Canadians have waited long enough. It is time to finally ensure that access—</ParaText>

I would have been more supportive if it had been a motion that asked us as parliamentarians to work with the different stakeholders, in particular the provinces. My colleague knows that when it comes to health care services, the provinces play a critical role in whatever it is. To have that optimum service, the provinces have to be involved. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060636">Mr. Speaker, in this country we really have a couple of different options. It is always open to the federal government to show leadership and to take the lead and extend essential health care coverage to Canadians, or it can work with the provinces and territories on a shared basis. As I pointed out in my speech, both those options are available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060637">The issue here before us today is that the NDP is taking a federal government initiative, a $6.9-billion tax cut, and instead targeting that tax cut and using the savings to immediately provide dental care to the 50% of Canadians in this country who do not have it now. That does not require anybody else's involvement. That is purely a federal government initiative, and the NDP is pushing the Liberal government to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060638">Ultimately, the way our health care system works is that health care is delivered at the provincial level, and the federal government provides transfer payments. It is all dependent on the federal government showing leadership and providing that funding. There is no reason that this approach could not be proceeded with as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060639">I want to leave my hon. colleague with one thing to think about: Dental care is an emergency, and many Canadians are suffering now. They need leadership from the government now. They cannot wait years or decades. They have already waited five decades. The NDP says it is time to act now.</ParaText>

During the lunar new year period, I visited many of the seniors in my community, and without a doubt, the vast majority of them said that this is their number one priority. They desperately need the government to act so that they can have the dental services and support that they need to live healthily. For some of them it is really as desperate as enjoying life, because without proper dental care they cannot eat effectively either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060641">The Liberals say they cannot support this motion because this matter is being studied at the health committee.

              <ParaText id="6060643">However, I would take that objection from my Liberal colleagues more seriously if I had not seen this already once before. They said the same thing when the NDP moved a motion in the House several years ago to move ahead with public pharmacare. They said they could not until the Standing Committee on Health issued its report. Then the committee issued its report and it called for public pharmacare, but they still did not act. Then they said that we had to wait for the Hoskins report. Those working on the Hoskins report did their work, and the Hoskins report issued a call for public pharmacare, and we are still waiting. To this day, the <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has never uttered a commitment to public pharmacare, nor has a single health minister of the three health ministers since 2015 of this Liberal government. All they keep doing is delaying, and that is after the Liberals promised public pharmacare in 1997. Forgive me if I am not going to take seriously another Liberal standing up saying, “Here's another reason Canadians have to wait before they get access to dental care.”</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060649">We can break this motion down into two parts. I agree, and I think most people in this House will agree, that we need to do more to serve the most vulnerable in our communities. I think all members have heard heartbreaking stories from their constituents. I have had constituents in my office talking about the difficulties they are facing related to dental care, health care or employment. There are a lot of important issues that we as members of the House of Commons should bring forward on behalf of our constituents. Therefore, I do not think we will hear very many people disagree with the need to have more means to help the most vulnerable in our ridings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060650">I am from Saskatchewan. I was an MLA in Saskatchewan for two terms and eight years. I have heard all the stories about Tommy Douglas. I know our NDP colleagues like to quote Tommy Douglas and talk about him bringing medicare forward. I believe it is one of the great advancements in Canadian history and he should be applauded for that, but he was also a very fiscally conservative individual. There are other quotes here that Mr. Douglas has often said that our hon. colleagues from the NDP do not attribute to him, but I would like to bring one forward. At one point in time, Mr. Douglas stated that if governments do not get out of debt, the decisions are made by the ones who lend the money. In other words, he was saying that, as a government, we need to have balanced budgets. That is something Mr. Douglas took very seriously, because if not, we are giving up some of our sovereignty and some of our ability to make decisions. Bringing forward public health care was very important, but he was also fiscally responsible. An NDP premier is not one of the first people I thought I would be quoting in this House. I hope my colleagues will forgive me. It is important to be fiscally responsible, because then we are able to make better decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060651">Another thing Mr. Douglas knew is we need to have a strong economy. If there is no money there to spend, we cannot spend it on our most vulnerable. That is very much something that should be brought into this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060652"> We have had some very disturbing decisions made over the last few days regarding our energy sector. I understand the commitment was $5.6 billion if fully implemented. However, over the last few years we have forgone $120 billion worth of investment into our oil and gas sector, which would have paid for programs for the most vulnerable, for public schools and for public health care. I find it very alarming, to say the least, that we have a motion brought forward by opposition members talking about the need to spend money, and on the other side we have the same people trying to ensure that projects do not go forward that would pay for these programs. At some point in time, that bill has to be paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060653">Two days ago, Teck Frontier withdrew its project worth $20 billion. We saw Enbridge withdraw the northern gateway project worth $7.9 billion. We saw the TransCanada Corporation withdraw the energy east project worth $16 billion. We saw Petronas withdraw the Pacific Northwest LNG project worth $36 billion. We saw Aurora LNG withdraw its project worth $28 billion. We saw Prince Rupert LNG withdraw its project worth $16 billion. We saw ExxonMobil withdraw its WCC LNG project worth $25 billion. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060654"> What all these have in common is that they are all private companies that wanted to invest their shareholder dollars, not public dollars. It is private dollars that they wanted to invest. When those projects go forward, they help pay for some of the programs that we want to have for our most vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060655">Moving forward as a country, we need to understand that the pie is getting smaller. That means there is less for everyone. There are fewer ideas for people to bring forward programs for everyone. There is less opportunity. I have constituents who have very rare diseases that they want covered by the drug formulary. They cost a lot of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060656">Where do we get the funds to pay for that? It is through private investment, through oil and gas companies, and through people investing in Canada because they have confidence that our economy is going to be strong. Right now, in the letter that was sent by Teck Frontier's CEO, that confidence to invest in our country is not there. That should be a worry for everyone in this chamber who wants to bring forward motions to spend more money on our most vulnerable, which I agree with. We need to ensure that we have the resources to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060657">I listened intently to my hon. colleague across the way. He was talking about the generic drug program. When I was an MLA, I am quite sure, coming out of the COF conference, the premiers conference, that Premier Ghiz and Premier Wall were commissioned to do a health report that brought forward the generic drug plan to make drugs more affordable for people across the country. I do not believe Premier Ghiz and Premier Wall were NDP premiers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060658">They were two premiers who got together and had some different philosophical ideas. They brought forward a report to ensure that cheaper generic drugs could be bought in bulk to benefit all Canadians. That is something we benefit from now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060659">Having people come together from different political stripes is a good thing and brings forward solutions. I am pretty happy that I was able to be a part of that. I learned a lot from Premier Wall. Working with partners is one thing that we learned as the government in Saskatchewan. I was part of the Saskatchewan Party government. That was a combination of Liberals and Conservatives in Saskatchewan coming together and forming a party to make sure that we would have good government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060660">I appreciate working together with people from across the aisle to bring forward good ideas, good policies and good programs, and to make sure we could be a better government for all Canadians. I believe that is why people sent us to this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060661">When I think about this motion, I think about breaking it into two parts. I believe everyone in this chamber thinks that for the most vulnerable in our society, programs need to be in place to ensure that they have a better quality of life. I think everyone in this chamber would agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060662">The other part is the financial aspect. How do we get there? Conservatives think we need to grow the pie, not just slice it up differently. We need to make the economic pie bigger. We need to ensure that we have more money and that our economy is growing so that we can bring forward these programs for all Canadians, making sure that there is a better quality of life for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060663">I believe that is something we need to have a very serious discussion about in this chamber going forward. I think that will happen after we are done these proceedings and are into the emergency debate. Is this a country that allows projects to be built? If it is not, then we need to have a discussion on how we are going to bring forward programs. It is going to be a more difficult discussion. There would be a much smaller pie for us to divide into programs that we want to see for our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060664">I believe we were sent here to grow this country, to grow our economy and to make sure our children and the next generations have more benefits, more ability to have great jobs and a better quality of life than we had. Going forward, we need to have that conversation to ensure that our economy is growing. We need to make sure we have good discussions about this to ensure that we have good programs for the most vulnerable in our society and so that Canadians have a better quality of life going forward.</ParaText>

I have not had a conversation on what numbers are true and what numbers are not. It is very difficult for me on this side of the House. They brought forward a lot of small business tax changes two summers ago. They were going to try to ensure that small businesses were hampered and were unable to do better business. When we see these proposed tax cuts, I do not believe the numbers. The Liberals always leave some room for imagination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060669">On the second question, the programs we can put in place to ensure people have a higher quality of life is of course important. We need to ensure we are able to fund these programs on a go-forward basis and have the ability to ensure that people who need the coverage have it.

              <ParaText id="6060676">When we talk about these national programs, in particular in the area of health care, it is very important for us to recognize the provinces play a dominant role in that whole area.</ParaText>

When we look at school divisions, they are in essence creatures of provincial legislation. Through the school divisions, very good quality dental services could be provided. It is a great gateway that could ultimately complement a national dental program in the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060683">When I was looking over both the text of the motion and listening to the debate so far, I like the first part, but I have a problem with the second part. The first part reads:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the House call on the government to change its proposed tax cuts by targeting benefits to those who earn less than $90,000 per year, and use those savings to invest in priorities that give real help to Canadians...</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060685">The first part is a rich mouthful. There is a lot there for Conservatives to agree with. We want to see more tax savings for Canadians with more reasonable means, people who are working class or trying to get into the middle class, a term that the government cannot define although it has a minister responsible for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060686">It is the second part I have a problem with. It says, “including dental coverage for uninsured families making less than $90,000 per year.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060687">That gives me a heavy groan. That is a Yiddish proverb, “A rich mouthful, a heavy groan”. The motion is exactly that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060688"> I could get completely behind the first part. It is rich in a lot of things I would like to see done for Canadians earning less than $90,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060689">However, it gives me a heavy groan when I see after the comma what is basically an intervention into a provincial jurisdiction. I am sure every Bloc member will appreciate this, because it is a provincial jurisdiction. It is up to our provinces to provide this. The Alberta government provides 21 different public service plans in health care, including drug plans and mental health plans that are created for our residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060690"> Let us talk numbers. My colleague who spoke before me talked about numbers. We have a $26.6-billion deficit. We are accumulating debt for future generations to pay off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060691">If we go back to budget 2015, it expected $263.2 billion worth of spending. Budget 2019 said that by the 2022-23 fiscal year, we would be spending $358.4 billion. That is an incredible increase in financial resources that the Government of Canada is expending. We do not have a surplus in any of those years. It is all debt and deficit spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060692">This is where I start having problems. When I look at these numbers, in budgets 2015, 2019 and 2020, we would be spending about $302.6 billion. Budget 2019 actually showed that we were spending $329.4 billion. We have a structural deficit in the country. The government is spending more money on programs than it is bringing in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060693"> I want tax cuts, especially for lower-income Canadians. It is targeted at the right place. The NDP has it right at the beginning of the motion and then completely loses the story on the back end when we look at the numbers and what is going on with public finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060694">I have looked at the main estimates and old age security payments for 2019-20 are $42.7 billion. It is one of the biggest programs in government right now. Guaranteed income supplement payments are $12.8 billion. Looking at these numbers, what strikes me the most is that in the past two years old age security has gone up by $4.5 billion in spending. That curve does not go down; it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060695">This is usually targeted toward low-income seniors who are receiving these payments. Obviously, we want to do right by our seniors who helped build this great country and set us on the right path to build an even greater country. Whatever we can do to make Canada better is something for which we should be striving. The problem is that we need to bring in enough revenue to pay for all these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060696"> The government in the last little while has announced $41.3 billion of new spending over five years, unbudgeted in any way. It is absolutely ridiculous. How can we make right by people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060697"> The previous member from Saskatchewan mentioned Roy Romanow. He was on a West of Centre podcast. He talked about fiscal responsibility, ensuring savings and thrift in government. These are all things with which I agree. Those Prairie NDPers are cut from a different cloth. It is a cloth that I sometimes agree with, not always but sometimes, especially at the provincial level. On the podcast, he said that when he took over the Saskatchewan government, it had $14 billion in debt. He talked about the reality. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060698">He said that if we do not get out of debt when we have a deficit and are accumulating more debt, decisions will be made by those who lend out money: bankers. They will make the decisions for us. Bondholders will be making public-policy decisions for us, because as credit ratings begin to downgrade, as the Moody's of the world, financial investors and speculators start making judgment calls on whether we are running our finances correctly, they will constrain our ability to make the right decisions for the residents in our provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060699">I will give the House an example from my province of Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060700">In 1990, when Premier Ralph Klein took over government, there was a terrible situation: a massive deficit, a large volume of debt. At that time, he tasked Stockwell Day and Jim Dinning, successive treasurers, to get him back on track. It required the closure of entire government departments. They were not doing this because they had some great love for putting civil servants out of work. They did so because those who were lending them money told them they would not lend out one more penny. They hit the debt wall. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060701">What happens when we hit the debt wall? We are incapable of borrowing and of paying debt interest. When debt interest becomes the second-largest line item in our budget, we have a spending problem and we have to stop. Those who suffer the most when those decisions have to be made are those who earn less than $90,000. They are lucky if they have an income. Usually they are losing their jobs at that moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060702">There came an oil and gas boom on the royalty side, specifically for natural gas, that helped Alberta get itself out of debt. By 2002-03, Alberta had paid its debt in full. There was a great sign that Ralph Klein used to hold. He was proud of it. That is an important image to remember. It has happened to provinces before, and there is no reason why it cannot happen to the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060703">One of my constituents sent me an email about the unconstitutional carbon tax. The Court of the Queen's Bench in Alberta has decided to call it a constitutional Trojan horse. We all knew this from the start. It was just an attempt to get more revenue into government coffers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060704">I remember this discussion at finance committee and asking a question about it, the same question that Leon in my riding asked: When are Albertans going to get a complete refund of every single dollar they have spent on this unconstitutional carbon tax in their province? I am not talking about the rebate. I am talking about 100% of the cost that was imposed, basically illegally, on Albertans, in my home province. That is what I want to know from the government. I want to hear the Liberals answer this question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060705">Difficult decisions were made by Roy Romanow, who was mentioned by the previous member. Premier Romanow had to close 52 rural hospitals. He said this on the podcast and I had to look it up afterward. I am guessing that did not make him a very popular premier, which he readily admitted afterwards, but service delivery had obviously changed in health care and those were difficult decisions to make. Those are not decisions I want to see a future government constrained by because bondholders, bankers and speculators are betting on whether Canada can pay off its debt and betting on whether Canada will ever get into a position where the deficit has been reduced to zero and we are on track to returning some of the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060706">There is no great recession going on right now worldwide. There is no reason we cannot return to a surplus budget. There is only one political reason for it: The Liberal government is incapable of stopping its spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060707">To return to my Yiddish proverb, “a rich mouthful”, the motion gets this right. People earning under $90,000 a year deserve greater attention from the government to lighten their tax burden. Working-class families, single-income families and single-parent families do not need to pay more in taxes. They should be paying less. The problem is that establishing a new government program now, after $41.3 billion of more spending, is the wrong way to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060708">I hope other members in the House will reflect upon these numbers. We are in a bad fiscal situation. Eventually, the big companies that do the ratings will take away our AAA credit rating. I do not want to be here when a government has to announce large budgetary cutbacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060709">Just to repeat, this is provincial jurisdiction. It is up to a province to decide how it wishes to spend its money. It is not for the federal government to intervene in what should otherwise be completely up to the provinces to determine.</ParaText>

It ran seven straight successive deficits. As a matter of fact, most of the debt that is piled up in this country was acquired under Conservative governments and Liberal governments. The Department of Finance did a study a few years back and found that per year of government in this country at the provincial and federal levels, the party that balanced the budget the highest percentage of the time was the New Democrats. That is a fact of this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060734">The PBO found that the Liberal tax proposal will cost $6.9 billion annually when it is fully implemented.

              <ParaText id="6060736">This is typical Liberal policy that the government has put forward. I can look to the previous choices the Liberal government has made. There was $14 billion in corporate tax cuts announced in the 2018 fall economic statement. In June 2019, the PBO stated that Canadian corporations may be avoiding up to $25 billion a year in federal income taxes. The Liberal government could go after this. The Conservatives have been talking about increasing the government's coffers. The Liberals could do this, but they refuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060737">From CRA's own records, we see that the wealthy and corporations hold at least 9% of Canada's total financial wealth offshore, resulting in an annual loss of at least $8 billion in government revenues. What is evident is the Liberals' determination to give the wealthiest Canadians even more of a share of that wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060738">It is clear that this Liberal plan would not help my constituents. However, what would help them is dental care coverage. Statistically, we know that every dollar spent by a government on a social program is worth five times that much to the economy. The dental program that we are proposing would save households $1,200 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060739">Canadians spend approximately $12 billion a year on dental services overall. Some of this is recovered through insurance, but a great deal comes out of people's pockets. In fact, six million Canadians avoid going to the dentist or receiving care because the cost is so prohibitive. Besides tooth decay, gum disease and tooth loss, a person's oral health is linked to other illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Inflammation seems to be associated with these diseases because bacteria flourish in plaque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060740">Publicly funded dental care programs need to be universal and provide essential care to those most in need, including children in low-income families, seniors living in institutional care, people with disabilities, the homeless, refugees and immigrants, indigenous people and those on social assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060741">All provinces and territories pay for an in-hospital dental surgery and some have prevention programs for children. Also, a number of ad hoc and charitable programs provide dental care to the poor. Many of them run out of Canada's 10 schools of dentistry, but these programs are a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060742">Canada has one of the lowest rates of publicly funded dental care in the world. According to a report by the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences, it is only 6% of total spending. Even the U.S. has a higher public share, at 7.9%. Many European countries include dental care in their universal health programs. In Finland, for example, 79% of dental care is publicly funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060743">The cost to the health care system overall is significant as well. Imagine a patient with an untreated tooth infection. At the low end, a trip to the hospital ER for dental pain costs the health care system $124. If the person needs to be hospitalized, that cost jumps to over $7,000 per visit. This is hard to justify considering this could have been treated earlier at a fraction of the cost if the infected tooth had been removed. It is only logical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060744">Many people without dental health coverage live with pain and discomfort to the point that they end up in the emergency room to have a tooth pulled or, worse, end up dealing with other illnesses linked to their poor oral health. What are the costs to our health care system to admit people to the hospital for something more severe when they could have been proactively visiting their dentist? Canadians take sick leave, which costs the Canadian economy about $16.6 billion annually. We could create a healthier Canadian economy with healthier Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060745">These are just the health aspects, but what about the social aspects? Oral pain, missing teeth or oral infection can influence the way a person speaks, eats and socializes. These problems can reduce a person's quality of life by affecting their physical, mental and social well-being. People with bad teeth can be stigmatized, both in social settings and in finding employment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060746">In many conversations about the need for a universal dental care program, our leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="253029" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, has spoken specifically about a woman he met on the campaign trail who was missing several teeth. She was embarrassed to speak to him. She told him that she found it difficult to find a job that paid more than minimum wage and that she would love to advance in her field, but felt her oral health and appearance were a hindrance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060747">I can tell members that when I am in my constituency and when I was on those doorsteps, I ran into this situation all the time. So often I engaged with folks in London who faced that exact same problem. Too often we treat the idea of dental care as a choice, and if a parent or an individual cannot afford care for themselves or their family, they are judged, but the problem lies in our system of care, or, to be more realistic, the lack of that system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060748">Dental care cannot continue to be treated as an unnecessary cosmetic procedure, privately funded and only for the lucky few, and excluded from medicare. Health care must take a full body approach. We cannot have a society in which only the rich are allowed to have good teeth and good health. That is not the Canada I want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060749">We know that the Liberals have no trouble working for the richest. They recently spent public money on big, profitable, well-connected companies like Loblaws and Mastercard and on subsidies to the oil and gas sector, but now it is time to show up for the working class, for families who need that change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060750">New Democrats have a solution. Instead of spending $6 billion of federal revenue on something that excludes 47% of Canadians, a huge majority of people in my riding, and only gives marginal amounts to those who earn under $90,000, an investment of $1.6 billion of that program can help everyone. This program would give immediate help to 4.3 million people and save our health care system tens of millions of dollars every year. That is why I am proud to support this motion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6060765">Madam Speaker, I thank my NDP colleague for her inspiring speech, and I look forward to hearing my colleagues' questions very shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060766">I would like to begin by proposing that we remember what our role is as representatives of our constituents. I think our primary focus must always be on trying to create a better, fairer, more progressive world where people can live in dignity, reach their full potential, hold meaningful jobs with good working conditions and have a good quality of life that makes life worth living. We always need to keep in mind that we are here to improve the quality of life of our constituents, to create a world with more justice and dignity for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060767">We in Canada are fortunate enough to have had a universal public health care system that is accessible to all for many years. It is an invaluable system that many people fought for, including the NDP, but also members of other political parties. Those people fought to have a system where everyone is treated equally when they become ill. When illness strikes, medical treatment is not provided just because an individual has a credit card or a bank account, but because they are a citizen of a country where a collective decision was made to treat people without discriminating on the basis of money, fortune or wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060768">Unfortunately, our universal public health care system was not accompanied by a universal public pharmacare system. We are the only country in the world where this incongruous situation exists. I believe we will have other discussions about pharmacare, which will greatly improve the lives of Canadians and significantly cut costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060769">Our universal public health care system is not perfect. The motion presented today by my party would address one of the problems. At some point, the human body began to be viewed as a puzzle, with some parts being insured and others not. If someone has a heart attack, they get in an ambulance and go to the hospital. If they need bypass surgery, it is covered. If they need open heart surgery, they will get it because the heart is covered by health insurance. If they break a leg climbing a tree and need a cast, the leg is covered. However, if there is a problem in a person's mouth, if they have trouble with their teeth, if they have a cavity or need a root canal, well, good luck. That is not covered. They have to get out their chequebook or credit card.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060770">Our system is flawed. The human body has been separated into various parts that are valued differently for insurance purposes. It is pretty odd. Dental care is extremely important to people. Millions of people in Canada cannot or will not have their dental problems looked after because they cannot afford to. About one in five people in Canada avoids going to the dentist because of cost. Does that make sense to anyone? Can we justify that to the people we represent, to our constituents? I do not think so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060771">During the last election campaign, I talked about this with people at their homes, in parks and in restaurants. They realized right away that it makes no sense that the quality of care we get for some parts of our bodies, like our mouths and teeth, depends on our wealth and good fortune. We value equality, and that is not equal. As a progressive, that is something I will fight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060772">As parliamentarians, whether we are in the government or in an opposition party, we have to make choices. From the beginning of the 43rd Parliament, the Liberal Party has made a very clear choice by proposing another tax cut that once again favours the wealthy. This is not the first time, either. The Liberals did the same thing in the last Parliament when they proposed a middle-class tax cut that did not give one cent back to people who earn less than $45,000. For the Liberals, people who earn $35,000 or $40,000 a year are not rich enough to be part of the middle class, so they got nothing. This year, the Liberals are proposing another tax cut which, let's face it, is an expenditure. It is money that is no longer going into the government's coffers. We are missing out on a certain amount of revenue, with no guaranteed results to show for it. We are not guaranteed better services for the public or a better quality of life.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060773">This completely irresponsible tax cut is going to cost us nearly $7 billion. The tax cut that the Liberal government is proposing is worth $6.9 billion, and once again, it will benefit the wealthiest Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060774">The biggest benefits, which will save people $300 a year or more, are limited to those who earn at least $113,000 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060775">The Liberals are saying that this will save the average family $600 a year. Only individuals who earn at least $143,000 will be eligible for that $600 a year, which is the maximum savings provided by this tax cut. The people in our society who are going to save $600 are the ones who earn nearly $150,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060776">Personally, I do not see this as a progressive measure. I do not think it will help those who are struggling and those who are the most disadvantaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060777">The NDP put forward a proposal that appears in the motion moved today, specifically, that anyone who earns more than $90,000 a year will not get a tax cut. Like everyone else, the first tax brackets will benefit, but above $90,000, there will be no tax cut. This measure will save Canada $1.6 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060778">It is not very complicated after that. The money that was going to the rich would be transferred to a new public dental care program that will cost between $800 million and $850 million a year, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. We save twice as much as we need to give additional coverage to 4 million Canadians, to people in the 338 ridings represented here, to people who are suffering and who cannot afford the care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060779">A society has to choose whether to take care of people or to give handouts to the rich. It is important to look at what we are facing today and think about what choice we have to make to help our constituents as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060780">We want public dental care to be accessible to people who earn less than $90,000 a year. Let us keep it simple. People who earn $90,000 or more do not get a tax cut, and people who earn less than $90,000 a year have a new social program that will make a real difference in their lives. The program will improve their health and will probably save our health care system money because it will prevent illnesses that can get worse when someone does not have access to care. We need to keep this in mind to ensure we are making the right decision. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060781">Many years ago, we made the good decision to develop a public, universal health care system. It was such a good decision that candidates like Bernie Sanders are desperately trying to institute this system in the United States, knowing that it would be the right thing to do and a positive social change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060782">Our proposal would cost less than $1 billion a year and would be funded from an irresponsible tax cut that helps only the wealthiest Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060783">Some people will say this encroaches on provincial jurisdiction. We have heard that one before. Since I am going to be asked the question anyway, I will remind hon. members that we have the principles of the Canada Health Act, that there are health transfers to the provinces and that there will necessarily be negotiations with the provinces to see whether or not they decide to get on board. Then, it might be worthwhile for Quebec to get $250 million to $350 million to allow Quebeckers most in need to receive dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060784">I think a responsible Quebec government is going to sit at the table, like every other province, and look at what can be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060785">The Sherbrooke declaration is indeed still part of the NDP platform, and Quebec's right to full compensation would inevitably be included in legislation. However, what we have before us today is not a bill or a federal-provincial negotiation. It is a motion. It is a direction that parliamentarians are giving to the government to tell it that this is important and that it should move in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060786">I want to reassure everyone. If this works out, it will not be a federal public servant playing around in people's mouths, it will be a dentist, and that dentist will probably be paid and hired by a clinic or hospital in Quebec, if you are a Quebecker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060798">It is true that having bad teeth is usually the most obvious outward sign that makes it possible to differentiate between social classes. Poor dental health has an impact on every aspect of a person's life. Everyone can understand how that could make it harder for someone to get a job and cause problems in their social and love lives. Let us be frank. In real life, having bad teeth causes problems. People will see the difference and this will create barriers in every aspect of the person's social and socio-economic life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060799">Yes, this is a good proposal. We need a tax system that is based on true progressivism to ensure that the wealthiest members of our society are able to help and to pay for the services of those who really need them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060801">The Bloc Québécois recognizes that health, including dental health, is a major concern for all Quebeckers. This issue has been one of the Bloc Québécois's key demands going way back. Currently, the federal health transfer goes up by 3% per year, but we want it to go up by 6% per year to make up lost ground and bring the federal contribution up to at least 25% of health care costs. Originally, the federal government contributed 50%. We fully agree with that idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060802">Still, the problem is that the federal government has to respect provincial jurisdiction to ensure the money will be used efficiently. We must avoid contradictions. My colleague just said that his party might have forgotten to include Quebec's right to opt out with full compensation and no strings attached in its motion. I am pleased to hear that. I would have liked to see that stated explicitly in the NDP motion, but I can understand that it was just an oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060803">That said, the Bloc Québécois cannot vote for a motion like this, for the reasons I just explained. The money needs to be transferred to Quebec with no compensation and no strings attached so that Quebec can decide how to use it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060818">I rise tonight to address a national economic emergency, the cancellation of the $20-billion Teck Frontier oil sands opportunity, even though the expert joint panel recommended it in the national public interest seven months ago. The cancellation of Teck Frontier will cost Alberta alone 10,000 badly needed jobs and will cost all 14 local and supportive indigenous communities their long-sought-after agreements with financial, education and skills training opportunities. It will eliminate the potential for $70 billion in revenue to all three levels of government for services and programs for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060819">People may think oil and gas is isolated to Alberta and Saskatchewan, but the energy sector as a whole is the largest single private sector investor in the entire Canadian economy. B.C., Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic Canada and all of the territories have onshore and offshore oil and gas resources, some stranded and some not, with related industries at various degrees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060820">Canada should be proud to be home to the third-largest oil reserves in the world. Canadians should also know the reality that 97.3% of it is in the oil sands, so Canada's oil future is dependent on the future of the oil sands. Every one oil sands job creates five jobs in other sectors in other provinces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060821">Ontario, Quebec and B.C. companies are the biggest suppliers to the oil sands. In 2017, oil sands companies, even after all the losses, spent $1.9 billion on goods and services from over 1,100 Ontario companies. Here is the alarming part. That was a 45% drop from what was spent in Ontario in 2014, before the Liberals were elected and launched their plan to “phase out the oil sands”, in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s words. In 2014, nine of every 10 full-time jobs created in Canada were made in Alberta, offering opportunities to everyone across the country and the world, driven by a thriving energy sector. I think most Ontarians would be surprised to learn that the contribution from oil and gas businesses to Ontario's economy is more than half of the contribution of the automotive industry. Over the next 10 years, oil and gas could generate $12 billion in tax revenues for programs and services Ontarians value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060822">The livelihoods of many Quebeckers also depend on the oil sands, where approximately 400 companies are direct suppliers to the industry in Alberta. The federal tax revenue generated from the incomes of those multi-generational Albertans and Albertans by choice working in the province's energy sector is shared right across the whole country. As my Atlantic Canadian family members and friends remind me, a rising tide lifts all boats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060823">In 2018, Canada's oil and gas sector still contributed seven times that of the auto manufacturing sector and 15 times that of the aerospace sector to Canada's GDP, even after the colossal drop in investment and activity. No Albertan and no Conservative wants to stand in the way of any other Canadian province, territory or industry. We want all to thrive. However, the attacks by the Liberals on oil and gas, their anti-resource, anti-business bill, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, their oil shipping ban bill, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, the drilling ban, the development prohibitions, the Liberal fuel standard, layers of new taxes, red tape, and ongoing and escalating uncertainty, are actually all attacks on all of Canada's economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060824">Nearly $200 billion in oil and gas projects have been cancelled or stalled, and 200,000 Canadian oil and gas workers have lost their jobs since 2015, a flight of capital that is the biggest loss of energy investment and jobs in any comparable time frame in more than seven decades. Teck's cancellation is the 11th major multi-billion-dollar mega oil and gas project to be withdrawn, and the latest in the list of 18 companies that have cancelled or frozen their Canadian energy assets in the same time frame. To put it in context, these numbers are equivalent to Canada having lost both the entire automotive and aerospace sectors combined in Canada. That would rightfully be considered a national economic catastrophe and a severe crisis by every member of every party in this House of Commons, and it has been going on in Alberta for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060825">Canadian-founded juggernauts like Encana and TransCanada are removing “Canada” from their name and moving out of Canada. Drilling companies like Akita, Trinidad, Ensign, Savanna, Citadel and Precision Drilling have all moved their drilling rigs, their expertise and their world-class skills to the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060826">Let me make clear the disproportionate impact of the attacks on the oil sands by the Liberal government on Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060827">As of 2018, capital investment in the sector fell by half, more than in the last seven decades, and the oil sands development in particular has experienced an even sharper drop in investment of almost 70%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060828">Whereas most provinces showed a decrease in people on EI as of January 2019, Alberta saw a major increase.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6060829">Business bankruptcies in Alberta were up 28% between August 2017 and August 2018. Business insolvencies in Alberta have skyrocketed by more than 70% from their 2015 lows, compared to a 13.5% decrease on average for the country as a whole over the same time period. Real estate vacancies and food bank use are both at record highs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060830">Albertans wonder why oil and gas job losses and all the related social consequences, such as suicides, family breakdowns and crime, do not seem to be occupying the permanent attention of national media and commentators. The cancellation of Teck just adds to an already existing pattern of crisis and it has been escalating since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060831">As recently as February 2019, Devon Energy announced it hired advisers to help sell off its oil sands assets and later sold its Canadian operations to CNRL. The CEO said the sale was part of the company's “transformation to a U.S. oil growth business”. Month after month it was the same in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060832">Imperial Oil says it is slowing down the development of the $2.6-billion Aspen oil sands project due to market uncertainty and competitiveness barriers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060833">Trident Exploration said it would cease operations. It left 94 people without work and a large number of oil and gas assets with no owner, including over 3,000 wells, 240 facilities and 500 pipelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060834">Later, Husky Energy cut 370 jobs after announcing it would cut capital spending by 10%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060835">Perpetual Energy then announced it had cut 25% of its workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060836">Here is the deal: Albertans cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel. The cancellation of Teck Frontier represents a growing crisis of investor confidence overall in the fairness, predictability, independence and certainty of Canada's regulatory system, policy framework and the economy overall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060837">Teck invested $1 billion over nine years while meeting every requirement during a multi-jurisdictional rigorous review and was approved. In the months since Liberals moved the goalposts, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> said the political approval depended on Teck's capacity to be net zero by 2050. Teck took that unprecedented step of self-imposing that exact goal far beyond the already world-leading standards of Canada and the industry average, not a regulatory requirement and found nowhere in federal law. Teck also committed to recycling 90% of the water used in processing and generating half the emissions of the oil sands industry average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060838">The Alberta government even agreed to adopt a 100-megatonne oil sands emissions cap to remove all the Liberals' excuses 48 hours before Teck's decision to cancel Frontier over public safety concerns, political risk and policy uncertainty in Canada became public. Teck's other assets are in unstable South American countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060839">We all know the truth here. In the last couple of weeks, Liberal cabinet ministers hinted publicly that they might delay past the February 27 deadline and that they were considering any and all information, presumably new or different from the evidence, science, technical, environmental and economic merits that actual experts already evaluated. Liberal MPs spoke out and promoted petitions and admitted most of the caucus was against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060840"> Is it really any wonder why the whole world is looking at Canada and wondering whether any major resource project can be proposed or actually built here ever again?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060841">Make no mistake, Canada's oil and gas is produced with the highest environmental and social standards in the world, literally second to none with an environmental performance index of 25, compared to places like Nigeria with an EPI of 100 or Saudi Arabia with an EPI of 86. This is what is so crazy about what the Liberals are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060842">Canadian oil sands producers lead the way. They have reduced emissions per barrel by 32% since 1990 compared to resources of similar kind around the world. They are the biggest private sector Canadian investors in clean tech in Canada and world leaders in R&amp;D and innovation. Canadian energy and the oil sands can be the future, not the sunset, and it should be for Canada and for the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060843">A painful truth is that this loss also represents an escalating national unity crisis. Western Canadians see political double standards for oil and gas, exemptions and blind eyes turned to projects, industries, exports in other provinces and foreign oil imports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060844">A strong Alberta means a strong Canada. It should be unthinkable for a sitting <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to attack the lifeblood and the primary industries of any Canadian province. Can we imagine a Prime Minister saying he was going to stand up to big auto in Ontario or big manufacturing in Quebec? Canadians would be rightfully outraged and so would Conservatives. It seems like in this House of Commons, it is only Conservatives who would be outraged at divisive political attacks on the lifeblood and industries of particular provinces and regions in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060845">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided his political gains were more important than the unity of our nation.

I do not think I have seen that in my 11 years of being here. We have had two emergency debates on two perhaps similar issues, but they are also different. What is happening to our country when we are at such a crisis point that we have had to have this kind of debate week after week?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060877">So far the government has managed, in terms of the oil industry alone, to drive $150 billion out of the country. I want to talk about this project specifically, and then I am going to get into a bit of the context for the decision that was made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060878">Frontier mine was a proposed oil sands mine located between Fort McMurray and Fort Chipewyan in northeast Alberta. The process for this application started nine years ago in 2011, so it has been nine long years and $1 billion spent. It was projected to create 7,000 jobs during construction and another 2,500 during operations. Building the project would have required a $20.6-billion investment, and it would have contributed $70 billion in federal, provincial and municipal taxes over 41 years of production. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060879">We hear about pharmacare programs and dental programs. If the government keeps driving businesses out of this country, we are not going to be able to afford anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060880">This project had first nations support. The company had signed agreements with the 14 indigenous groups who live near it, and the latest agreement was made just last weekend before the decision was to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060881">Let me talk about the emissions. In its report on Teck Frontier, the review panel wrote the following:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The project is expected to have emissions that are equivalent to or lower than oil produced in some other jurisdictions. Not permitting oil production from the Frontier project may result in exporting emissions to other jurisdictions with higher emission intensity than the project and increase overall global greenhouse gas emissions on a per barrel basis. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6060887">In November 2011, we had an application. In July 2019 we had a review panel that recommended the approval and then, to be quite frank, the cabinet sat on this for many months with the decision actually being due this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060888">On Sunday night many MPs from the west, and I was one of them, got off the plane and heard the news.

              <ParaText id="6060889">I want to give the House some context for the decision. The government loves to say it was the company that made the decision but let us put this decision in context.</ParaText>

Whoever thought that he meant to phase them out within a year or 24 months? No one thought that, but obviously that is what he is intending to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060891"> I would like to contrast this with the Alberta premier, who acknowledged the need for transition, but he said that he hoped that last barrel in the transition period would come from a stable, reliable democracy with some of the highest environmental human rights and labour standards on the earth. He wanted that to be Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060892">Obviously, the Liberals do not want it to be Alberta. They want it to be Saudi Arabia. While we still need oil, we all recognize the need for transition. However, the government wants to remove that from Canada but not from anywhere else.</ParaText>

It is very clear he did not want to make a decision. What I have learned in this business is that things do not happen by magic. It was absolutely no coincidence when all of a sudden there was a decision not to go ahead with that project and that it was going to be withdrawn. We all would love to have been a fly on the wall for the conversation between the Prime Minister and the CEO of the company before that decision was made. There is no coincidence in this kind of business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060904">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says that he does not direct the RCMP.

Is it not interesting that he does not want to make a decision about this particular project and all of a sudden a decision is made for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060905">From the SNC-Lavalin affair, we all remember the statements about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> being in “that kind of mood”. In this case, he has a crisis on his hands. It is happening throughout the country and he has dealt with it poorly. He also has an important project that he does not want to make a decision on. He has a caucus revolt and then, by coincidence, the company decides to withdraw its application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060906">This is a shame. It has certainly worried us incredibly on our side of the House.

It is the goalpost that the company agreed to meet. It was the Premier of Alberta who made significant commitments in terms of where he was willing to go, what he was willing to do to make sure the project happened. What really has to worry us, by suggesting that Canada has an unstable framework, is looking at where else oil is produced in the world.

              <ParaText id="6060921">Don Lindsay's letter mentions that it is difficult to get investments from various institutions because they want to see how this project fits in with the climate action. Those are the things that are driving this, and it is not the spot price of oil. The price of oil was predicted not to go above $60 or $70 for the next 20 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6060953">The best projects are those that have the lowest pollution per unit of production, develop a path to net-zero emissions and minimize impacts on biodiversity and the natural environment. In 2020, these conditions are increasingly non-negotiable. Leading money managers and investors like BlackRock are making sustainability and climate risk tenets of their investment strategy. They are pulling their money out of environmentally risky ventures and diverting to sustainable projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060954"> We are very concerned that times are tough in the resource sector and in Alberta due to market conditions. Let there be no mistake, our government stands with workers in Alberta, and with resource sector workers across the country. That is why we are moving forward with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. This project is delivering nearly 3,000 jobs for Albertans today and will peak at 5,500 in the near term, which is important for Alberta and thus for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6060955"> We also understand, and I believe most Albertans understand, that it is time Canadians had a much deeper and more thorough conversation about how we keep our energy sector competitive in a world moving to net-zero emissions by 2050.

              <ParaText id="6061000">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the charming member for <Affiliation DbId="252574" Type="2">Repentigny</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061001">I will try to keep a cordial tone, as I have noticed in the last few minutes that there is enormous tension in the House. I hope my Conservative friends will keep the same cordial tone that I will use during this short speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061002">On the way here, I thought about what we would be doing tonight. To be frank, I am wondering why we are having an emergency debate tonight. The reality is that the cancellation of the Teck Frontier mine project is the result of a private company’s decision to abandon its project because it sees that it is not economically viable in the current context. It has made a decision to stop investments, which I agree are huge enough, so as not to fall into a money pit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061003">I think the Conservative Party has always been the party of some form of capitalism. It is a party that clearly understands the implications of the free market system. I do not understand why the party that constantly invokes market forces, the free market and small government is asking today that the House intervene when a private company makes a decision. I find that rather curious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061004">In 2011, this private company based its analyses on the price of a barrel of oil, which was around $100. For the project to be viable, the price of a barrel of oil would have to currently be between $80 and $90. As we know, the price of oil is around $50 to $55. Therefore, I am wondering if my friends in the Conservative Party would like the Canadian government to end up supporting the Teck Frontier mine project, given that the market is unable to currently support this type of fossil fuel project. There is a really big question mark in my mind. I am certain that my friends in the Conservative Party would be happy to respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061005">There is another rather crucial element. I do not know if members are aware of this, but the majority of large investment funds are taking their money out of fossil fuels. They realize that the climate crisis is real and that, in the next few years, fossil fuels will no longer be driving economic development. They are investing in the energy transition instead. It seems to me that people should be aware of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061006">Perhaps the economy of the future lies not in petroleum resources, but in cleaner energy and the energy transition. That is something that is important to be aware of, and I think the financial community has come to that realization. In my opinion, if the main oil-producing provinces do not wake up to that reality, then they will be doomed to relive the same type of crisis as they are experiencing now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061007">The climate crisis is not a myth. Some people are even talking about this being the anthropocene era. Humans are having such a devastating effect on the planet that they may eventually render it uninhabitable. Personally, I do not want to live with such a liability. I am thinking about the planet that I want to leave to my son. The Conservatives often calculate the public debt and say that we are going to leave a public debt to our children. In my opinion, there is a much bigger debt that we may be leaving to our children, and that is the environmental debt. If we are living in an environment where the climate is constantly changing and the air around us is unbreathable, we are not leaving our children much of a legacy. I think our Conservative friends should think about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061008">I think I know what this evening's debate is about. Perhaps my Conservative friends and I will say the same thing. I get the impression that the western provinces feel alienated from the rest of the country. I get the impression that they feel like the federal government has let them down. We can agree on that, because Quebec has been through it before. To come back to the western provinces' feeling of alienation, I could tell them about Quebec's special circumstances and especially about the impact that fossil fuels have had on our economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061009">It should be noted, and this is quite important, that from the early 1970s until 2015, the Canadian government apparently invested $70 billion — that is the figure we have, but we will never know the real amount — in the technology needed to develop the oil sands. Of that $70 billion, $14 billion came from Quebec, but that investment did absolutely nothing for us and contributed nothing to our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061010">Another NDP politician I quite like is Thomas Mulcair. Before the 2015 election campaign and before he was flirting with the idea of becoming prime minister when he saw some rising support in the polls, Mr. Mulcair talked about Dutch disease. What is that? Dutch disease is the phenomenon whereby the value of our dollar increases to the point where it puts pressure on our exports, thereby leading to a downturn in manufacturing, which is based primarily in Quebec. Therefore, any time natural resources, such are oil, are heavily developed, the Quebec economy suffers. That is what happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061011">This means we spent $14 billion to undermine Quebec's manufacturing sector. That is a fact. I could mention Dutch disease to any number of people, and they will be aware of that logic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061012"> Briefly, it seems to me that if the problem we are having today has to do with a feeling of alienation among people in western Canada and the impression of being mistreated by the Canadian federation, I could tell them all about Quebec's specific case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061013">First, I should mention that twice during constitutional talks, when the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords were signed, we sought but never received recognition. Not only did Quebec not receive the recognition it was seeking on those two occasions, but it also hit a wall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061014">Second, I would point out to my western colleagues that, in 1982, the Constitution was repatriated without our consent. Quebec never signed the Canadian Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061015">Third, I would remind my colleagues that, in 1969, the Government of Canada launched broad consultations on bilingualism and biculturalism. In the end, the government realized that making Canada a bicultural country would result in recognizing Quebec's special status. The government therefore decided to scrap the idea and make Canada a multicultural country so as to avoid giving Quebec the recognition it wanted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061016">As members can see, on four or five occasions, the Canadian federation clearly said no to Quebec. If my Conservative Party friends want to talk about feeling alienated this evening, I get it because it has happened to us repeatedly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061017">In this case, this sense of alienation is fuelled by economic interests. Every day in the House I keep hearing that Canada is not doing enough to support the oil sands sector. My friends from the Conservative Party keep coming back to that and are constantly asking that we build a pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061018">I find it funny we are never in a position where we have to ask for hydro towers to be built. Hydro-Québec has never received a penny from the federal government to help install its infrastructure, which contributes to delivering green energy throughout Quebec, energy that could also be used for the other provinces and even exported to the United States. Surprisingly, we are not hearing those speeches here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061019">When I look at everything that has been done by the Canadian government, I have one question. Think about the Trans Mountain pipeline that was purchased for $4.7 billion. Initially we were told it would take another $7 billion to get the pipeline up and running, but that amount is now $12 billion. That pipeline is going to end up costing at least $16 billion. Personally, I think it is ironic to hear the west complaining today about alienation and saying that the federal government is not doing enough.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061050">Madam Speaker, will it be the Teck Frontier project or the climate emergency? The government no longer has to make that choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061051">I will once again talk about the oil sands because they are causing a number of issues. Yesterday, Teck Resources announced that it is cancelling the Frontier project. The Frontier project would have resulted in the permanent destruction of old growth forests, fish habitat and highly biodiverse wetlands that currently cover almost half of the projected site. The neighbouring Dene and Cree indigenous communities would also have suffered the consequences of the project, faced with the risk of losing their traditional knowledge forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061052">However, despite the clear conclusions about far-reaching irreversible consequences, and even acknowledging that the greenhouse gas emissions generated by Frontier made it impossible to meet the Paris targets, the joint panel recommended the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061053">With this project, some things have been said about the extent of irreversible damage to the environment and natural habitats. An additional 4.1 to 6 megatonnes of CO2 equivalents would be produced over 40 years. That did not matter. A comprehensive study of Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada’s largest national park, found that every aspect of the park is deteriorating and that this project would really not have helped. This key conclusion was ignored. Of the 17 indicators of the park’s environmental health studied by UNESCO, 15 are in decline. This was downplayed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061054">A 161-page report on this park noted that, without proper intervention, its heritage value would be lost forever. Members can rest assured that I am not going to list everything that is compromised by a project like this: wetlands, disruptions in the migratory paths of birds, others at risk of extinction, massive sections of boreal forest being cut down, subterranean pollution, exposure to toxic substances. I will stop there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061055">Let me be clear: Nothing I just listed is in the national interest. Despite all of the downsides, that is what the committee retained. It needed to be in the national interest. Defining national interest is another kettle of fish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061056">The developer withdrew his project. The fact is, the developer knew full well that his project was not viable. It was not viable according to a very important metric for a company: its financial and economic viability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061057">Teck talked about an oil price of $95 per barrel. Teck used a base price to establish its financial parameters that was not recognized by an international organization that Canada is a member of and which has exceptional credibility. I am referring to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The institute examined the Teck application. The findings were crystal clear. They described it as reckless or irresponsible and imprudent. That is the Teck project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061058">According to the legal definition, recklessness is a state of mind where a person or a minority group pursues an action deliberately and without justification by choosing to ignore the risks of such an application. That is recklessness, and that is Teck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061059">In addition, forecasts by key industry leaders clearly show that the price of oil should be between $60 and $70 per barrel for decades to come and be relatively stable. We should also remember that oil from the oil sands is one of the most expensive to produce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061060">Even Teck acknowledged in December, to its investors in the Fort Hills project, that the barrel price was going to remain at $60. That was not taken into account in the analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061061">It was the responsibility of the review panel to ask the proponent about the financial information submitted. The panel should and could have asked the proponent to review its forecasts and resubmit them for review. It was the responsibility of the panel to adjust the financial information, which it did not.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="30">(1930)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061062">I think we are going to have to carefully scrutinize the committee's future conduct. Why would the committee have approved the project, considering the environmental and indigenous concerns, not to mention financial concerns?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061063">I will now get to my second point, namely, the many disputes with indigenous peoples. I highly doubt the government or the House has heard the last of the contentious issues being raised by indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061064">We keep hearing that indigenous communities support projects like the Frontier project and other current projects. Without going into the details of aboriginal treaty rights and the federal legislation that establishes guardianship of indigenous peoples, it is important to reiterate that indigenous decision-making processes are not monolithic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061065">Indigenous communities have a governance structure that we should try to understand better in order to enter into respectful dialogue with them. Band councils were created by the federal government, and we cannot regard them as the only legitimate representatives in any kind of discussion. It is important to note that the Supreme Court has recognized hereditary chiefs as being responsible for decision-making regarding their traditional lands, that those chiefs have been speaking out since 2010 when the project was first being developed, that protesters began setting up encampments in 2019, that the company had to get injunctions, that the RCMP moved in in early 2019 — I am not talking about now — and that they arrested 14 protesters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061066">I think we have a better idea today of what the hereditary chiefs wanted and what they did not want. This project infringes on aboriginal treaty rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061067">Some leaders signed agreements, but their arms were being twisted. I can even sum up what some leaders said. They said that they oppose the project but signed anyway so that they could at least get something out of it, since their opposition is never taken into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061068">The leaders of Smith's Landing First Nation asked the Government of Alberta for a meeting four times. They had the support of the Northwest Territory Métis. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip from the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs spoke up and rallied other regions, as we have seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061069">François Paulette, whom I am always pleased to see at United Nations environmental conferences, is an elder from Smith's Landing First Nation. He has made it clear that the 33 Dene nations oppose the Frontier project and any plan to expand the oil sands. When Mr. Paulette attended UN climate change conferences, such as COP22, COP23 and COP24, he tried to educate all the attendees on the rights of indigenous peoples in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061070">Alice Rigney, a Dene elder in Fort Chipewyan, said that the Frontier project would completely destroy the land and everything that goes with it, including the people, the birds, the animals, the fish and the water. Others have made similar statements, but I do not have time to read them all because I only have a minute and a half left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061071">Just because someone signs an agreement does not mean that they are happy about the project. In this case, the testimony shows that it is the lesser evil, but it is evil nonetheless. It is a little like saying that agreeing to take medication means someone is happy about being sick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061072">The Alberta government created a $1.25-billion program for members of indigenous communities who want to invest in big oil and gas projects. To me, that is buying people. Will the Premier of Albert keep that money and continue to use it to help indigenous people? That should be suggested to him. It would be an act of good faith that would help promote reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061073">The Bloc Québécois is pleased that this project has been withdrawn, but I am choosing my words carefully. We still take exception to the lack of professionalism and rigour on the part of the joint review panel, whose work should be closely monitored to ensure that it is making decisions based on facts.</ParaText>

In reporting its results for 2019, the company announced a writedown on the value of its minority stake in Fort Hills, a Suncor Energy oil sands mine. The company itself recognized that this was no longer working, that there was a problem. This was above all an economic decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061097">Teck Frontier was never the solution the <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals said it was, and it is not the solution the Conservatives are now claiming it is. Teck is another example of the <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> failure of leadership on fighting climate change and creating jobs for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061098">I am surprised that we are here for this so-called emergency debate. How does this debate constitute an emergency? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061099">Teck pulled out of a project that was a bad decision economically, given that its business case relied on extremely high oil prices, for decades to come, of over $95 a barrel, much higher than what Teck told its own investors and almost double what our oil prices are currently. It was an even worse environmental decision, given the astronomical CO2 emissions from the project and the impact on land, air and water. The Teck Frontier project would have emitted four to six megatonnes of CO2 every year in its operation. To put that into context for my Conservative colleagues, four megatonnes of CO2 is equivalent to the emissions that all the light-duty vehicles in British Columbia produce every year. That is every single car, every single small truck and every single personal vehicle. The Teck Frontier mine would have emitted that amount every single year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061100"> The greenhouse gas emissions from the Frontier mine are fundamentally inconsistent with Canada's climate targets and the Paris Agreement commitments. When we are already so far away from achieving our climate commitments, anyone serious about meeting our climate obligations, our obligations to our international commitments and to future generations, could see that this project could not be approved. Nevertheless, the Liberals looked as if they were seriously considering moving forward with the project. The Liberals committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, but this project would have emitted four to six megatonnes of CO2 every year until 2067. It just shows that the Liberals' words were just more empty words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061101">The Liberals keep saying they want to balance the economy and the environment, but they are failing at both. They decided to buy a pipeline for $4.4 billion and now want to borrow an additional $12.6 billion to construct the Trans Mountain pipeline, which will increase tanker traffic on the coast, where my constituents and I live, sevenfold and increase our greenhouse gas emissions in the middle of a climate crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061102">The Teck Frontier mine, the proposal that the Liberal government was seriously considering, would have put endangered species in northern Alberta at high risk, would have devastated irreplaceable wilderness, would have had detrimental impacts on treaty rights and would have knocked us even further off track from our climate goals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061103">Instead of empty promises, pipelines and bad projects, let us invest in long-term sustainable jobs in Alberta and across Canada. Investing in transit, retrofit, green infrastructure and clean energy will not only help us meet our climate targets but can also provide good family-sustaining jobs in a low-carbon economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061104">New Democrats proposed a plan that would have created at least 300,000 good jobs in the clean-energy future for the next four years, but we have not seen that kind of leadership from the Liberal government. We need to build zero-emission vehicles here at home and we need to make it easier to buy and charge zero-emission vehicles no matter where we go. We need to be not only producing electric vehicles in Canada but also providing incentives targeted to made-in-Canada vehicles only, giving manufacturers a powerful incentive to build. This safeguards good jobs and strengthens our auto sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061105"> We need to electrify our fleets, making public transit cleaner, more convenient and more affordable. We need to provide training for workers to transition into the low-carbon economy. We need to provide support for workers, for families and for communities so that the changing economy actually works for them. We need to boost clean-tech research and manufacturing with “buy Canadian” procurement. We need to create good family-sustaining jobs by building infrastructure in every region of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061106">We could save families $900 or more a year in home energy costs with energy-efficient upgrades. Making bold investments in energy efficiency not only pays off in terms of reducing emissions but also brings savings on energy bills. It also means good jobs in communities from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061107">We need a government that is committed to supporting workers today, not with imaginary jobs and projects with no business case, but supporting workers while equipping them with the skills and opportunities of the future. It means making sure that Canadian workers have access to meaningful training funds to use when they need them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061108">I also want to take a moment to mention an incredible organization, Iron &amp; Earth, which is a worker-led initiative. These are oil and gas workers who want to work building renewable energy projects, who organized to support each other and who advocate on their own behalf. They are not only supporting their fellow workers, demonstrating how their skills are transferable and connecting these workers with training, resources and a network they require to position themselves in the new renewable energy industry, but they are also calling on the government to implement a national upskilling initiative, investing in training that would empower oil and gas, coal and indigenous workers to get into the renewable energy economy. These oil and gas workers see the opportunities that could be possible if the government truly took its commitment to workers and the climate seriously, but successive Liberal and Conservative governments have left workers to navigate these shifts on their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061109">Workers in Alberta are feeling the impact of job losses, and 19,000 workers lost their jobs just in the last month. The answer to this problem is not projects that are economic and environmental nightmares. The answer is not empty promises of jobs from projects that have no business case.

The company lost the money and Alberta lost the jobs.</ParaText>

How can we provide immediate jobs to Alberta right now if we do not approve projects such as this one?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061130">I am so tired of listening to this blame game in which not one member of Jason Kenney's government or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Liberal government is actually working with Albertans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061131">Teck was never the solution to the crisis impacting my province. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew that, and so does Mr. Kenney. Our energy sector plays an important role in our economy. The Alberta oil and gas sector has, for some time, been the economic engine that drives this country and has driven our province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061132">I am a fourth-generation Albertan. I am deeply proud of Alberta and our heritage, and I will proudly declare that I come from a long line of hard-working Albertans who have contributed to the oil and gas industry and have built our province and our country. It is for those Albertans that I am speaking this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061133">Our leadership has failed us. Not only have they failed to work with Albertans to diversify our economy and make sure Albertans were well placed for the 21st century, but they have told stories about it. We have been told that oil and gas is coming back like the past. We have been told that there is another boom just around the corner. We have been told that this project or that project will save us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061134">I am the daughter of an oil and gas worker. I have lived through the boom-and-bust industry in this province, and it is not going to be coming back the way we had it before, full story. When the Conservative members of this House fail to acknowledge that, they are not doing justice to people in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061135">What we have not been told is there was another path forward. Norway has $905 billion saved up as a result of their energy royalties. We have saved $17 billion in our heritage fund. That is $905 billion to $17 billion. To top it off, Norway started saving in 1990. When did we start saving? It was 1976. I was four.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061136">The Conservatives have given away our wealth. The Liberals have given away our wealth. The government has known for decades about greenhouse gas impacts and it has not done the saving and planning that we needed to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061137">What is worse than that is the failure of our leadership to fight the most important crisis of our time, the climate crisis. We need deep investment in Alberta. We need to invest in Albertans. We need to give Albertans the jobs that they earned and deserve. We need to stop lying to them that there will be some sort of a renewal of oil and gas, that it is coming back to $95 a barrel, because it is not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061162">In many ways, Teck Resources' decision to abandon the Frontier project based on its own economic and operational interests has highlighted two of the biggest challenges of our time. The first is to ensure that our natural resources, including our oil reserves, continue to provide Canadians with jobs and opportunities. The second is to honour our commitments, both at home and abroad, to combat climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061163">Our government has been dealing with these two challenges since taking office. Canada is the fourth-largest oil producer in the world. Our oil industry continues to be a source of jobs and prosperity for the entire country. We also know that in this century of clean growth, economic prosperity and environmental protection must go hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061164">We have therefore taken a balanced approach. This approach uses revenue from our oil resources to invest in clean energy and the technologies of tomorrow. We know that, in the medium term, the world will not give up oil as an energy source. In fact, we expect demand for oil to increase in the coming decades.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6061165">Our goal is to make sure Canada produces the cleanest petroleum in the world, and we have already taken huge strides. Our petroleum producers have cut the intensity of their emissions by 28% since 2000. Many companies have committed to achieving net-zero emissions, including Canadian Natural Resources Limited, MEG Energy and Shell. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061166">This indicates that major energy companies know the importance of establishing Canada's brand as the cleanest supplier of resources anywhere. We see the same thing happening with natural gas, where LNG plants are making greater use of electricity. One project, LNG Canada, will have “best in class” emissions. Other smaller projects will be even cleaner, with emissions as much as 90% below the global average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061167">Canadian innovators are also leading the way on removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it safely. In fact, four of the largest-scale demonstration projects in carbon capture, use and storage are in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061168">We have also put a price on pollution, we are phasing out coal by 2030, we are focused on helping remote communities move off diesel and we are making generational investments in clean energy, clean technologies and green infrastructure. That infrastructure includes a nationwide network of charging stations for electric vehicles and incentives for people to buy these vehicles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061169">Canada already generates more than 80% of its electricity with no emissions, and our goal is to get to 90% by the end of this decade. Those efforts are complemented by significant new investments in smart grids right across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061170">Two other areas where we see great potential are hydrogen and small modular reactors. We are in the process of developing a hydrogen strategy to grow production for use in transportation, mining and industry. Small modular reactors, as the name implies, are smaller in size and output than traditional nuclear facilities. Some can be transported on the back of a truck, making them ideal for remote areas. Because they are modular, they can easily be added to one another to meet changing demand. Best of all, they produce absolutely no pollution, making them a key tool in the transition to a net-zero economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061171">All of these efforts, and more, are aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, making Canada one of some 77 countries to set that ambitious goal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061172">We are also active on the global stage through the G7 and G20 as well as through Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation, which Canada was proud to host last year. As part of Mission Innovation, Canada has pledged to double its investments in clean-energy research and development from $387 million to $775 million this year alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061173">We are also involved in the International Energy Agency, COP and the International Energy Forum. We are also engaging with international partners to position Canada as a player in establishing secure and sustainable global supply chains for the minerals that are powering many clean-energy technologies, minerals that are in growing demand around the world. Recently, for example, we finalized a joint action plan to collaborate with the United States on critical minerals. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061195">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to the debate this evening. Let me remind the House that over the last four years, our government's plan has been focused squarely on investing in the middle class and helping people who are working hard to join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061196">We believe all Canadians should benefit from our country's economic success. Cutting taxes for all but the wealthiest, and giving more money to middle-class families and those who need help the most, are only the first steps in our new mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061197">We will also make it easier for people to get an education, buy their first home and find care for their kids. We will help workers enter the workforce, grow their skills and transition between jobs. We need to continue to build confidence in Canada's economy, making sure the world continues to see our great nation as a great place to invest. We are building this confidence with targeted support for businesses, which will encourage more job-creating investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061198">To make it easier for small businesses to succeed and create more jobs, we have cut taxes for small businesses not once, but twice. This is part of our government's responsible plan to build a strong, growing economy. We will build on the progress of the last four years and continue to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians today but equally, if not more importantly, well into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061199">Part of that means acknowledging the regional challenges that exist, particularly in the oil and gas sector. For that reason, we are moving forward with the Trans Mountain expansion project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061200">At a time when most of our energy exports go to the United States and the economies of Alberta and Saskatchewan are struggling, Canadians know that we need to open up new international markets. The Trans Mountain expansion project will create thousands of good middle-class jobs, accelerate Canada's clean-energy transition and open up new avenues for indigenous economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061201">Today, construction is well under way and thousands of Canadians are hard at work. Contractors have started work at the Burnaby terminal, the Westridge Marine Terminal, the Edmonton terminal and pumping stations in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061202">In October, construction began on segment one in the Edmonton area after the Canada Energy Regulator released land for construction. The work on segment two started immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061203">This has allowed the company to start putting pipe in the ground. The goal is to have the expansion project in service by the latter half of 2022. In the short term, this is creating good, well-paying jobs. So far, over 3,000 people have started working on this project. At peak construction, there are expected to be over 5,500 people employed on sites across Alberta and British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061204">Once completed, the project will open up new international markets, get us a fair price for our energy resources and provide much-needed relief to the economies of Alberta and Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061205">The project, as it stands today, is very different from the project that was originally planned by Kinder Morgan. It will now support more union jobs in B.C., as well as in Alberta, and the project has been designed to a higher standard for environmental protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061206">As the company has been working on the engineering plans for this project, environmental protection is always at the forefront. Trans Mountain has a robust safety regime, with important risk controls for all traffic and oil tankers in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061207">Over the last 65 years, Trans Mountain has developed comprehensive safety, spill prevention and emergency response plans to make sure the company is protecting the public, the environment and its employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061208">The project will also help move less oil by rail and more by pipeline, which is the most economic, environmentally sound and safe mode of transportation. Our government remains confident that the project is commercially viable. We are comfortable that Canada will see a positive return on its investment when it comes time to sell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061209">Once completed, the pipeline's capacity to move Canadian oil will almost triple, unlocking potential to meet the world's demand. This is a monumental project, one in the best interests of the entire country. The project will also create economic benefits for many indigenous communities. To date, Trans Mountain has signed agreements worth more than $500 million with 58 indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="20">(2020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061210">It will generate new revenues for all levels of government for the betterment of Canada and Canadians. Over the course of this project's construction and the first 20 years of operation, the Conference Board of Canada estimates that this project will add over $160 billion to the Canadian economy and add $46 billion to government revenues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061211">Almost half of these revenues, $19.4 billion, will go straight to Alberta, supporting provincial and municipal programs that Albertans depend on each and every day. Every dollar the federal government earns from this project will help fund new technologies and green energy solutions that will ensure Alberta remains an energy leader as we work together to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061212">Let us make no mistake: In a world where Canada makes a rapid and decisive transition to a low-carbon economy, the oil and gas sector has an important role to play. In 2018, we announced an investment of more than $1.6 billion for Canada's oil and gas sector. It included measures designed to support workers as well as their families, foster competitiveness and improve the long-term environmental performance of the oil and gas sector. Investments have already been made to support oil and gas companies, reduce their carbon footprint and develop alternative uses for their products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061213">To conclude, by building the Trans Mountain expansion project, we can make sure we are able to safely get more Canadian resources to world markets where we can get good prices for them. That increase of revenues will benefit everyone. It will mean more money for businesses to create good, well-paying jobs for Canadians. That is more money for hard-working families, money that can be spent to help local communities and grow our economy.</ParaText>

When Kinder Morgan first proposed it, the price was somewhere on the order of $5 billion. That is quite a jump. It will affect the profits of the producers who will be using it because the tolls will go up, but it is also increasing the cost to Canadians. About $8 billion of that we will never get back, even if we sell the pipeline. However, there probably will not be any opportunity for that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061231">There is a war on the working men and women of this country. If people do not believe me, just ask the 7,000 would-be workers at the now cancelled Teck Frontier mine in northern Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061232"> If people do not believe me, ask the thousands of workers who would be on site now, finishing the construction of the northern gateway pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061233"> If people do not believe me, can ask the 200,000 out-of-work Canadian energy employees who sit staring at their phones, waiting for it to ring with a job offer across northern Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061234">If people do not believe me, ask the more than 20% of young males in the province of Alberta, who are unemployed and desperate for opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061235">If people do not believe me, speak to the 14 first nations communities around the perimeter of the Teck Frontier mine, whose leaders had signed agreements for that mine to provide opportunities for their young people to escape the clutches of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061236">If people do not believe me, then talk to the steelworkers who would have provided steel for the energy east pipeline, which is now cancelled, ensuring that the insanity of selling our oil on the cheap in the west, while buying it at a premium in the east, will go on for an indefinite period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061237">If people do not believe me, look at the footage of the fitness instructor in Victoria, B.C., who arrived at a blockade and begged protesters, saying to them over and over again, “I've got to get to work. There are 40 people expecting me to teach a class. Can you please get out of the way and let me do my job? I don't even know what your political cause is about, but surely it can't be about blocking a middle-class fitness instructor from going to work.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061238">If people do not believe me, ask any of those thousands of people if there is a war on the working men and women in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061239">Let us be clear about what this dispute is not about. First, it is not about the environment. The blockaders who are stopping the Coastal GasLink pipeline, many of whom think it is an oil pipeline, are standing in the way of the construction of the pipeline and the LNG Canada plant, which would ship Canadian natural gas to China and other Asian markets to replace coal-fired electricity and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, by some estimates as much as 30 million tonnes per year. That is because natural gas emits half the greenhouse gases for each unit of electricity that it generates versus coal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061240"> Canada is perfectly positioned to reduce global emissions by shipping our natural gas. Why? We have 1,220 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. We have a cold climate, which makes it easier to cool and therefore liquify and transport natural gas. We supply our LNG facilities with clean, green, emissions-free British Columbia hydroelectricity. We are closer to the Asian markets, significantly closer, than the Gulf of Mexico, which would be our principal competitor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061241">In other words, we are perfectly positioned to ship clean, green Canadian natural gas and reduce global emissions, but these blockaders do not want us to. They would rather see coal combustion in Asia pump millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere, coal being the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions anywhere on planet earth. However, these protesters would like to continue to see dirty foreign coal, as long as it demobilizes our population and prevents our people from getting to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061242"> No, it is nothing to do with the environment. Nor was it anything to do with the environment when they, along with the help of the government, shut down the Teck Frontier mine, which had agreed to zero-net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In fact, the company has already lowered its emissions to below the intensity of other competitors around the world. That oil will still be produced, it will still be burned, it will just come from outside of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="35">(2035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061243">It is not about the environment and it is not about first nations land rights. When it comes to the Coastal GasLink, 20 elected councils for first nations had supported and signed agreements to profit and benefit from that GasLink. They all support it. In terms of the hereditary leadership, many of them, too, support it. In referenda by local communities, there has been overwhelming support for these projects of which the blockaders are standing in the way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061244">With respect to the Teck Frontier mine, there are 14 first nations communities around the mine and all 14 support the project. The cancellation of that mine went not only against the wishes of the regulator, which recommended its approval, of the Alberta government, which has supported it, but all 14 first nations communities. Therefore, no, it is not about first nations land rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061245">In fact, it is very clear that the cancellation of this project did not have the free, prior and informed consent of those first nations communities. The protesters and ultimately the government that killed the project went directly against the wishes of first nations people. First nations are being used as an excuse by anti-energy and anti-working class protesters and their friends in the government, by downtown, urban-dwelling Liberal elites who look down on the working class people of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061246">If members do not believe me, look at the <Affiliation DbId="252878" Type="2">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> own remarks. He said that he wanted to phase out Canada's energy sector. He did not say he wanted to phase out global petroleum. He said that he wanted to phase out Canada's oil sands. He is not concerned about increased production in the United States, where oil production has more than doubled in the last 12 years. He is not concerned about increased oil and gas production in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Libya and other places. Those places can go on producing and burning oil. It is Canadian oil and gas he wants to phase out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061247">However, it is not just oil and gas. He said that he believed southwestern Ontario should move away from manufacturing. He said, when he was abroad at a fancy conference, that he thought construction workers brought negative gender impacts to rural communities. That is the attitude of the downtown, internationalist, globalist elite who look down their noses at the working people of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061248">I will conclude on an optimistic note. Canadians are proud of working-class people and they are increasingly prepared to stand up and fight back. I believe we will have a renaissance of the working class in the country when we remove the government obstacles that stand in their way, unleash the unmatched power of free enterprise, remove the obstacles so projects can go ahead and our industries and our energy sector can come roaring back to life to give those young people the opportunity to put their God-given talents to work, to give indigenous people the opportunity to trade again in commerce and to exploit natural resources again in our country. I say again, because that had been the tradition of first nations people for thousands of years before Europeans arrived on this continent. That is the future we will fight for as a Conservative opposition and it is the future that Canadians, together with us, will win for our country. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061255">Let us look at the facts. The company invested $1 billion over 10 years. Companies do not make 30- or 40-year investments based on the daily price of crude oil. They know that prices fluctuate day to day, and they are not going to cancel a 30- or 40-year project on the spot price of West Texas Intermediate. The company knew the basic price of oil since 2014, when it originally dropped. That is not new information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061256">What changed the company's decision was that the government allowed for lawlessness to erupt like a volcano across the country, while imposing excessive regulatory delays. Since July, the government had a recommendation from the regulator to approve it. Until present, it had not done so. The company got the message that Canada was an inhospitable place in which to do business, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> got exactly what he wanted, which was the cancellation of this massive project.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6061267">Madam Speaker, earlier tonight we heard a Liberal member of Parliament tell this chamber that the government's goal in Canada is to produce the cleanest oil in the world. However, this is not true. We know what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told Canadians some years ago: The goal is actually to “phase out” the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061268">I can say this with some certainty because Canada is already an environmental leader when it comes to refining and producing its petroleum products. It is one of the cleanest producers in the world. If that is the goal, the government could say it is mission accomplished. It could get on with creating jobs and opportunity in Canada and exporting this technology and our clean ethical products around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061269">We know the decision that came down from Teck is a result of a market failure, which is produced by policy uncertainty. The result is fewer jobs, higher energy prices and less of Canada's ethical oil being consumed at home and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061270">Teck's decision is a blow to Canada. It is devastating to Alberta's economy. It is also problematic and hurtful and is raising questions in Alberta about its place in Confederation in Canada. Jobs have been lost, opportunities have left, tax dollars are evaporating, and we now hear voices in western Canada wondering what Alberta's place is in the federation. This is a realistic question we hear, as people who look to Ottawa see a government trying to turn off this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061271">This is not the first time we have seen these actions from a federal government that is focused elsewhere. In my home province, energy east was killed. The government tried to say this too was a market decision, but energy east was following all the rules that were laid out by the Government of Canada. Those rules were changed midstream, something we never see. The company engaged in good faith in the Canadian regulatory process. It spent $1 billion trying to go through that process. Then the government changed the rules. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was not willing to spend a nickel of his political capital in Quebec, so the company walked away. It was another lost opportunity for Canada, an opportunity to bring the real eastern Canada, Atlantic Canada, into this nation building.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061272"> We look west and to central Canada and see jobs, growth and opportunity. We say in New Brunswick that we would like a piece of that. Instead of sending our best and brightest to work in this industry, this vital Canadian industry, we would like to see a piece of that in Atlantic Canada. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party have other ideas. They want to shut it down. They wanted to shut it down in the east and now want to shut it down in western Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061273">Tonight I had the good fortune of hosting Preston Manning here on the Hill. Mr. Manning was in town promoting his new book about political involvement and engagement, entitled <I>Do Something!</I> I have known Preston Manning for 25 years now. When he sat in the House, his mantra was “the west wants in”. Thirty years ago he was championing western Canadians to come to Ottawa, roll up their sleeves and work with fellow Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061274">Teck abandoned its project, not because of the market but because of policy failure and policy uncertainty, just like TransCanada did on energy east, just like Kinder Morgan did by bailing out of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which was purchased by the federal government, because things were falling apart so quickly, because of policy and regulatory uncertainty. Today what do we hear in western Canada? Not that the west wants in, but maybe, just maybe, that the west wants out. This is deeply concerning and should raise alarm bells at the highest level of the federal government. We do not want to see this happening.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061275">Our country is strong because of western Canada. It is strong because of all parts of this country. If we have a region or province that feels shut out of the corridors of power and feels its concerns are being ignored, this is a problem, almost a crisis. I hope the government will reconsider its position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061276">Some say this decision by Teck was made because of a downturn in prices or they say that Teck is just hitting the pause button and will return. Some are even saying that in a way Alberta deserves this because it is not saving enough of its resource. However, there is no downturn in the industry. It is a made-in-Canada problem, a made-in-Canada downturn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061277">One only needs to look at the United States of America. It is booming. It is being called a blue-collar jobs boom. Jobs are being created, wealth is being created and opportunities are being created. At the same time, America last year, under President Donald Trump, believe or not, was the world's largest net CO2 reducer in the world. America has figured out that one can be prosperous, can cut CO2 and can create jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061278">To the idea that Teck will return, Teck is not going to return as long as the current government is in office under these policies. In fact, dare I say this is probably the last large-scale project we are going to see come to our shores. Why would a company come here? Project after project after project has been either cancelled, abandoned or killed by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061279">As for the notion that Alberta deserves this because it is just not saving enough compared to some European countries, those countries are not part of grand federations. Alberta has shared its wealth. It has shared the wealth with this federal government and it shares its wealth every single year with provinces across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061280">My province of New Brunswick receives a third of its budget every year from transfers from the federal government, generous transfers I know Albertans and other western Canadians are proud to pitch in to help. In the past, they have been allowed to do what they do best, which is to create jobs and opportunity and to share that wealth. They have grown mightily and we have seen a population boom in western Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061281">To my western friends, when the Liberals come to them and say not to worry and they will help with more transfers and EI, I say to run to the hills. We have that in Atlantic Canada. Life is pretty good, but that is not how one creates a growing economy that is going to see families grow, people move in and economies prosper. We are fortunate and thankful to have those transfers, but that is not the road a country follows to grow itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061282">Today Canada is poorer because of this decision that is a direct result of the federal government. Indigenous communities that had agreed to it and were looking to participate are poorer. The provinces are going to be poorer over the long run as well. The government is destroying reliable energy, affordable energy and Canada's ethical energy industry. For that I say shame, because increasingly we are finding energy is cheaper outside of this country than good old made-in-Canada energy, and I decry that. </ParaText>

She is only doing what all of us in this House would do when representing our constituents, and I salute her for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061296">I understand that she is disappointed by the decision of Teck Resources to withdraw its application for the Frontier mine project, but proponents make business decisions every day and we may not always like them. In this case, Frontier had the potential to create good-paying jobs during construction and would have created new wealth and opportunities across the country. It would have generated new revenues for all levels of government. Perhaps, most importantly it carried the support of all 14 surrounding first nations communities. That was no small accomplishment, particularly in this challenging time when we must find innovative ways to balance economic growth, environmental protection and indigenous participation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061297">Indeed, even as Teck Resources acknowledged that it made a difficult decision based on its economic and operational interests, the company's CEO, Don Lindsay, also identified the larger issue at play. He wrote that Frontier:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061299">Teck Resources is right. We need to continue to have a positive discussion, to search for common ground and move ahead as a country, which is also why now is not the time for taking sides, drawing lines or fanning divisions. That has never served Canadians well in the building of our country and it is not helpful now. Instead, we need to engage in constructive dialogue here in this House and across the country, because we are at a pivotal moment in our history, grappling with national issues that are not easy. On the one hand, the federal government has a core responsibility to ensure Canada can develop its abundant natural resources, get them to market and support good middle-class jobs. That is why major infrastructure projects like new pipelines to tidewater are essential. They create access to new markets and better prices for valuable Canadian resources. On the other hand, we also know that responsible resource development is only possible when we earn public trust by addressing local, environmental and indigenous peoples' concerns. Our government is committed to meeting this dual challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061300">We passed legislation last year that specifically puts in place new rules to better protect our environment and communities, while making sure good projects are built to create good jobs for the middle class. There are literally hundreds of major resource projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars either under way or planned across Canada over the next decade. Dozens are in the oil sands and all would help to make Canada a global supplier of choice for the materials and finished projects that will drive a low-carbon future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061301">Canada's petroleum sector is part of that. It is a key contributor to employment and economic growth. It enriches communities in Alberta and across Canada. According to some of our most recent data, the oil and gas sector currently contributes about 8% to the national GDP and employs upward of 564,000 Canadians in direct and indirect jobs across the country, including indigenous communities. It is also an important partner in our climate change effort and our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. That is worth emphasizing, because there is a persistent myth that petroleum-producing countries like Canada cannot be serious about climate change. I understand why that might be. There are some petro-states with dubious records on climate change, but Canada is not one of them. In fact, it is just the opposite. We are one of 77 countries to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050 and we intend to do it, just as we are doubling down to exceed our 2030 climate targets by putting a price on pollution, phasing out coal-powered electricity and making generational investments in clean energy, new technologies and green infrastructure, because many of the breakthroughs that will get us to where we want to go have yet to be invented or need a little help getting to market.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061302">That is why we announced the winners of our breakthrough clean-energy solution initiative earlier this month as part of our efforts to bring the public and private sectors together to invest in potentially game-changing new technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061303">Canada's petroleum industry has been part of this energy transformation. For example, over the past decade Canada's petroleum sector has accounted for almost 70% of all private sector spending on R and D in energy innovation across the country. This includes the oil sands top 13 producers, which have been pooling their resources to fund more than a thousand distinct innovations and technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061304">Federal scientists in Devon have been working with industry on these advancements, and our government is investing $100 million to support the industry-led clean resource innovation network, which is aimed at making Canada's petroleum sector the cleanest in the world. I know we can get there. We are doing all of this because every climate change model suggests that we can meet our global targets while having cleaner oil and gas powering much of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061305">How is this possible? There are two points. First, fossil fuels currently account for just under 80% of the energy used around the globe. Second, even under scenarios in which we keep the planet from warming more than 1.5°, fossil fuels still account for 58% of our energy and oil production is still around 65 million barrels a day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061306">We can and should do even better than that. We should aim for less than a 1.5° rise, but my point is that fossil fuels will remain an important source of energy for a long time. Why should the best-in-class oil not come from Canada, from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061307">Let me be clear. That does not mean that we can carry on with business as usual. We cannot. Major changes are needed now. That is why we have a vision based on four pillars to make Canada a global leader in the clean-energy future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061308">The first is to enhance energy efficiency, because the best sources of energy are the ones we do not use. In fact, according to Efficiency Canada, conserving energy could take us 25% of the way to our Paris goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061309">The second is to be using more clean power, particularly in energy-intensive sectors such as transportation and heating, as well as mining and petroleum extraction, so that we have the world's cleanest mills, mines and factories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061310">The third is to expand our use of low-carbon fuels, as many indigenous communities are doing by using biomass from forests as a source of both power and jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061311">The fourth pillar is producing the world's cleanest petroleum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061312">All of these are global game changers that will help accelerate a generational energy transformation. Canada can lead the way through the wealth of its land and the wisdom of its people. That is our vision. That is what our government is doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061332">Madam Speaker, our government firmly believes that the environment and the economy go hand in hand. We are committed to a federal assessment regime that is robust, based on science, protects our rich natural environment, respects the rights of indigenous peoples and supports our natural resources sector. We know that efficient, credible assessment processes are essential to encouraging investment in Canada and maintaining economic competitiveness.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061334">The Frontier oil sands mine project underwent a rigorous environmental assessment that took into account scientific evidence and indigenous knowledge, and was informed by federal experts and extensive consultation and input from indigenous peoples and the public. The environmental assessment of this project was conducted by an independent joint review panel, an excellent example of how the federal government can work co-operatively with other jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061335">Under the federal legislation, a final decision on the project was required by February 28, 2020. As we all know, Teck publicly indicated its decision to discontinue the project on February 23, 2020. While Teck has indicated that it no longer intends to move forward with the proposed Frontier oil sands mine, the Government of Canada is committed to working with the resource sector to make sure that the best projects get built so that we can create jobs and ensure clean, sustainable growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061336">The opposition wants to focus on the discontinued Teck Frontier mining project, but let us not forget something very important: that we have hundreds of major resource projects worth $635 billion already under construction or planned across Canada over the next 10 years.

To support Canada's competitiveness and to attract investment, the new impact assessment system provides clear expectations and shorter and strictly managed timelines, while aiming at avoiding duplication in other jurisdictions wherever possible with one project, one assessment. These new rules aim to ensure public confidence by making federal decisions about projects like mines, pipelines and hydro dams more transparent and by ensuring decisions are guided by science, indigenous knowledge and other evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061339">We also realize that climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. Not everyone in the House does, but we on this side, of course, do.

Canadians are feeling the impacts of the changing climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061340"> Climate change is a huge challenge, but the opportunities are even greater. Again, we need to move on. Taking strong action can protect the health of Canadians, support biodiversity and create opportunities for Canadian businesses and jobs in the clean-growth economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061341">Since the 2015 election, the federal government has been helping Canadians to seize on these opportunities.

              <ParaText id="6061347">Madam Speaker, that is a great speech. I think I have heard that speech in so many other debates in the House. It is a canned speech. I really appreciate hearing it again, at least the last two-thirds of it. It did not sink in the first 100 times I heard it in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061348">However, I will concentrate on what this debate is about, which is the Teck Frontier mine. I know the hon. member mentioned it a little at the front of his speech. I will address some of the things he said about it with respect to its viability. He drifted off into all things about climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061349">I am going to ask the member about the 10-year process, the $1 billion spent by Teck in getting to this stage, and the joint provincial-federal body that looked at this assessment said, “Yes, you pass all the benchmarks on this, plus you're involving all 14 indigenous bands and they have all signed off on it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061350">The company met all the social and environmental guidelines required of any development in Canada. Therefore, I would like to know what the quid pro quo was for Teck to back away in the last five days. Teck is a mining company. Can we talk about the commitment from the government that it will not be getting $1 billion back from some rebate on its carbon tax going forward? If the member could commit to that, I would like to hear it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061426">Some may find it funny that we are supporting Donald Trump's America this way, but we Conservatives believe that Canada would be much better off if we were energy self-sufficient.

              <ParaText id="6061427">For nine years, Teck Frontier had been working on an oil extraction project so that Canada could stop buying oil from the United States and become self-sufficient. This project would have created 10,000 jobs, including 7,000 in operations and close to 3,000 in mine construction. The project would have required investments of $20 billion that would have been beneficial to Canada's economy. We are talking about $70 billion in economic benefits for the various orders of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061428">Unfortunately, this project is dead. It died due to government inaction. The government did everything in its power to throw a wrench in the works of this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061429">As I said, for nine years, people spent $1 billion preparing the project. They brought in the best specialists in the world to find the best ways to produce oil with the least energy and the best environmental footprint possible. What is more, Alberta's energy sector has reduced its pollution levels by 33% over the past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061430">Everything was ready. In July, the file was placed on the desk of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada, ready for approval. This was the last step in the process. In nine years, every provincial, federal, regional, environmental and economic step had been completed. One of the most important steps was to secure the support of the 14 first nations directly affected by the project. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061431">The current government keeps crowing about national reconciliation. Instead of building bridges, we are seeing barricades going up across Canada. Real reconciliation means working hand in hand on successful projects, not giving away people's money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061432">As Felix Leclerc said, “The best way to kill a man is to pay him to do nothing”. Unfortunately, the first nations have been victims of this terrible approach, whereas these projects would allow them to work hand in hand with non-indigenous people and be a full partner in prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061433">Last July, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had a potential project for approval in front of him that was good for the Canadian economy and for all Canadians. Just before the election, perhaps worried, or fearful, about the political implications, the Prime Minister left the file to gather dust on his desk. The election was then called. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061434">After the election, he did not know what to do with the project. He found two ways to throw a wrench in the works. Even though everything had been done properly, the Liberal government, which wanted to really make sure the project was not approved, invented two new demands to see how the industry would react. It was taken by surprise when the company was able to meet both of these new demands. Everything was set to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061435">Four days before the project was to be approved, Teck Resources found out that the government had let prominent members of Parliament publicly announce that the project was not good.

What an affront to this industry that is fundamental to our country. It is the Prime Minister who is acting like that, and it is certainly not for everyone's good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061445">The Financial Post reported today that $150 billion in investments have been lost since the Liberals took office. Meanwhile, in the United States, production more than doubled over the past 12 years, including under Barack Obama. The Prime Minister's close friend was not afraid to develop his country's full energy potential. He realized that energy self-sufficiency is a good thing and that there is no shame in producing shale gas or shale oil. The United States drilled 670,000 shale gas and oil wells under Barack Obama. I look forward to seeing the reaction of the Quebeckers who love Barack Obama so much when they hear that fact. That is a leader who cares about his country's economy, not a leader who shows contempt for his economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061446">Sometimes people say that Quebeckers do not like oil.

Need I remind the members that 50,000 people in Quebec work for the petrochemical industry? Need I remind the members that Quebeckers are quite familiar with pipelines?

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6061471">Canadians have told us they want a government that protects our environment and the health of our communities, and that supports opportunities and economic growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061472">With its Frontier project, Teck Resources was making every possible effort to achieve those goals. Teck was proposing to build, develop and rehabilitate a 260,000-barrel-a-day drilling operation located in northeastern Alberta, 30 kilometres south of Wood Buffalo National Park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061473">When the project was reviewed, the environmental assessment process reflected the integrity of Canadian values, particularly regarding things we have heard about so far such as guaranteed meaningful consultation with indigenous peoples and Canada's contribution to the fight against climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061474">As an essential part of the review process, the former minister of environment and climate change entered into an agreement to establish a joint review panel with the Alberta Energy Regulator in May of 2016. The panel found the project would result in significant adverse effects on asserted aboriginal and treaty rights and would also contribute to existing significant adverse cumulative effects to the asserted rights, use of lands and resources and culture of indigenous groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061475">Additionally, on July 25, 2019, the joint review panel for Frontier released its report and concluded the project is likely to result in direct significant adverse environmental effects in a number of areas, including to the physical and cultural heritage of indigenous groups that use the project area, in the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by indigenous groups, to the Ronald Lake bison herd and to migratory birds and other species at risk that rely on wetlands and old-growth forests. The panel concluded there would be significant cumulative effects in these same areas in addition to cumulative effects on woodland caribou. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061476">Taking into consideration the significant direct and cumulative effects identified that cannot be mitigated, the panel made 77 recommendations to parties. The panel's role was to provide recommendations to inform the minister's decision at the end of the assessment on whether the project is likely to cause significant environmental effects within federal jurisdiction. That consideration was still in progress when Teck decided to withdraw its application. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6061477"> However, on February 23, Teck informed our government that it wanted to withdraw its regulatory application from the federal environmental assessment process. Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> can stop an environmental assessment at any time if a proponent informs the minister in writing of their intention to not complete the project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061478">I have no doubt that this was a very difficult decision for Teck. The letter Teck's CEO sent to the minister clearly demonstrates the need for all levels of government to work together to promote climate action and clean growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061479">As Teck's CEO said in his letter, Canada needs to continue to show climate leadership. He believes that Canada has the potential to be a global provider of sustainable, climate-smart resources to support the world's transition to a low carbon future.</ParaText>

We must take action on climate change to reduce pollution and thereby provide certainty for business. As he said, “Global capital markets are changing...and investors and customers are increasingly looking for jurisdictions to have a framework in place that reconciles resource development and climate change, in order produce the cleanest possible products.” We agree.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061514">I will start by recognizing the role that the energy sector, particularly in western Canada, has played and will continue to play in supporting our prosperity across this country. Many of my colleagues have highlighted that in their speeches here this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061515">The economic benefit that these projects have brought to our country have helped pay for public services from Newfoundland to British Columbia and everywhere in between. In my riding of Kings—Hants there are many residents who have benefited and continue to benefit from these types of projects, and they are not just Alberta projects or western Canada projects. They are truly national projects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061516">My perspective on the discourse around the Teck Frontier decision, particularly in the last month, is that it was polarized in a very detrimental way. In one sense, many of my Conservative colleagues alluded to the positive impact that this project or similar projects would have on job creation and taxation for public spending in this country, and that certainly resonates with me. However, there is very little acknowledgement of the environmental impacts of these projects and our ability as a country to meet our international climate targets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061517">Some of my Bloc, NDP and Green colleagues rightfully pointed to the reality that these projects, like Teck, create challenges for us to be able to meet our climate targets and that they have an environmental impact both locally and regionally. However, I think they fail to appreciate that the oil and gas industry will play a reduced but still important role in the Canadian and global economy in the days ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061518">The reality is that Canadians want balance. They want a government that is focused on climate change and protecting the environment, but also supporting a strong economy. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made this clear time and time again, and we have done that. We have created 1.2 million jobs since 2015 while implementing a price on pollution and reducing the GHG emission gap that the Conservative government had left us in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061519">I want to provide a couple of examples which I believe illustrate Canadians' desire for a government that is balanced on both sides of this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061520">Canadians overwhelmingly support a price on pollution. They overwhelmingly voted in the last election for parties that want to move forward on environment and climate change. However, Canadians overwhelmingly also support the construction of Trans Mountain pipeline. Canadians are pragmatic, and they want a government that has this balance. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061522">I want to address first the narrative from the Conservatives that Teck represents 10,000 jobs, and that somehow Alberta and western Canada's only way forward is through oil and gas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061523">The member for <Affiliation DbId="252800" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> suggested that people in her province want to work, but suggested that seemingly the only way forward or the only type of work is in the oil and gas sector. I know that is important, but to suggest that this is the only way forward is, frankly, naive of the other opportunities. I do not mean to be unparliamentary, but I think it sells short the potential that is in western Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061524">I want to talk about the 10,000 jobs. We know that there would be 10,000 jobs if construction had moved forward. However, Teck decided not to move this project forward, and the jobs would have only been created if the project were to be built. The CEO of Teck had mentioned three impediments in being able to move that forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061525"> One impediment was price. The Government of Canada does not control the world oil price. The project was built on an economic analysis of $95 for a barrel of oil. I believe right now the price of oil on the global market is about $50. Although my Conservative colleagues would talk about the viability of this project, there is no doubt that the analysis was originally built on an expectation of something that is far from reality at this point or in the foreseeable future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061526">They talked about a partner. The Government of Canada is not involved with supporting a private sector partner to move this forward, and so that would be another impediment. Of course, our government is committed to making sure the pipeline and Trans Mountain happens so that we have the ability to get our resources to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061527">However, the narrative in the House has been “if only this project was approved”, which, of course, we did not have the ability to choose to go forward with, and “if only 10,000 jobs would be created” is a fallacy. We cannot tell Canadians that if only this happens they will have 10,000 jobs, because it is selling short and not explaining the nuances of this particular project.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="20">(2220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061528">Here is why it is a fallacy. As far as I know, there are currently 38 petroleum or oil and gas projects that have been approved. They could start tomorrow if industry wanted to move them forward. They have gone through the regulatory process, but they are not being built. As much as my Conservative colleagues would suggest the cause is Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> or other legislative measures that we have taken forward on environment, the reality is that these energy companies are looking at a 40-year window. They are recognizing that the world is making a transition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061529">We are moving to a low-carbon economy. We are moving on renewable energy around the world, and they are rightfully asking whether they can return their cost of capital. We know that the Canadian energy sector is important and that they do amazing work, but we also know that the process to extract the bitumen from the oil sands is much more energy intensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061530">The fact is that we have 38 projects. Some colleagues in this House would be excited by the fact that they are not being built because they would put us further and further away from our emission target, and I can appreciate that. However, I think all Canadians, not just Albertans or those from western Canada, need to understand the importance that these projects have played and the revenue that they have created for our economy to pay for public services. We need to make sure that we can transition and support, if these energy companies do not want to move forward on these projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061531">Those who would suggest that the petroleum industry in Canada has no future, or that it is not economically viable, fail to appreciate that transition does not happen overnight. They fail to appreciate the work the Government of Canada has done in the last four years to meet and exceed our Paris climate accords. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061532">In 2015, our government inherited the reality that our country was on pace to miss our international climate targets by over 300 megatonnes. In the four years that we have been in office, we have been able to reduce that gap to 72 megatonnes, and that is not including the measures that we will be bringing forward in this parliamentary session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061533">My message to my progressive colleagues in this chamber is that we need an industry and we need western provinces that will co-operate and help us get there. We need to be able to work with them accordingly. Having a petroleum industry that provides the needed international product and also helps our country on its path to meet its much-needed GHG emission targets is the best path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061534">I, for one, certainly appreciate Don Lindsay's words on reducing partisanship on these particular issues. We can find a way to balance the reality that the petroleum sector will play an important role in the Canadian economy and the global economy in the days ahead, but it will not necessarily play the same integral role in the next 50 years as it has in the last 50. I think we need to be mindful of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061535">I have appreciated the opportunity to speak to this issue this evening, and I welcome some questions from my colleagues accordingly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061557">I also want to talk from the perspective of my constituency, my colleagues, my friends and my family. A lot of people who are very close to me work in the energy sector. One of my best friends worked in the energy sector during his time at university. He was a roughneck. He was a rig hand. Now he is an anesthesiologist. People do leave the oil field and get different careers. That should be their choice, not the choice of a select few elite who think their jobs are not worth having anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061558">I have heard that a lot in the chamber today. There is a group of people within the chamber who think they should have the say as to whether oil and gas workers, hard-working men and women, deserve to keep their jobs. That is not right. They are one of the most innovative groups of people in our country. They work hard to ensure that what they do is cleaner, greener and better than any other country in the world. To have a group of people in this chamber say they are not good enough is absolutely ridiculous. Those members should all take a long look in the mirror when they get home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061559">Standing up for our constituents is what we should be doing. I am not sure if they are doing that. I am not sure if they sent out householders or surveys on whether their constituents are against Canadian oil and gas. I have been in the chamber for only three months, but I was an MLA for eight years. Canadians would prefer to have Canadian gas going into their gas tanks. Whether in the Maritimes or in B.C., Canadians would prefer to have Canadian energy heating their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061560">That is what this emergency debate is about. It is about whether we think Canada should be a country of yes: yes we can build a project, yes we believe in our energy sector and yes we believe in the hard-working men and women who work in our oil and gas sector. We think they have the right to try to make their companies cleaner and greener. I believe they deserve to have that chance and not be phased out by people in this chamber.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061610">Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to participate in this timely emergency debate initiated by my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="252803" Type="2">Lakeland</Affiliation>, on the cancellation of the Teck Frontier mine project, a project in northern Alberta, that if completed would have had the capacity to produce up to 260,000 barrels of bitumen a day, resulted in 2,500 construction jobs, 7,000 permanent jobs and $70 billion of new tax revenue. Not only that, it was a project that was supported by and would have been beneficial to the 14 affected indigenous and Métis communities. Here we are tonight, and all of that is gone. The project is cancelled. It is history and it is not coming back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061611">In the face of the cancellation of the project, what has been the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response? It was effectively to shrug off the cancellation and say it was merely a decision of Teck, nothing more and nothing less. The vast majority of my constituents and Albertans do not buy the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s explanation. They know there is one person who bears considerable responsibility for the cancellation of Teck, and that is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061612">Let us look at the facts. Teck went through all of the regulatory hurdles. The joint review panel gave it the green light all the way back in July of 2019. All that needed to be done was for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet to give it the final approval. What did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet do? They dithered and delayed month after month, undermining investor confidence. Then, more recently, they sent the signal that they were seriously contemplating killing the project altogether, a project that not only would have resulted in thousands of jobs but in billions of dollars of new tax revenue that would have gone some way to restoring investor confidence, which has been sorely lacking and undermined thanks to the policies of the Liberal government. They were contemplating killing a project that really sets the gold standard when it comes to clean emissions with respect to GHG intensity, which is roughly half that of the oil sands industry average, which was projected to be carbon neutral by 2050. It is indeed a project that the joint review panel noted might actually help reduce overall GHGs, not increase GHGs, having regard for alternate sources. For the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in the face of this devastating news for my province of Alberta, to simply shrug his shoulders and say that it was a decision of Teck truly requires a suspension of disbelief. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="50">(2250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061613">Make no mistake about it, the decision of Teck was not made in a vacuum; it was made within the context of regulatory uncertainty that arises from misguided policies on the part of the government that is literally killing Canada's energy sector. From the tanker ban off the northwest coast of British Columbia to changing the rules with respect to upstream and downstream emissions midway through the approval of energy east, ramming through Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8945674" Type="3">C-49</Document> at the end of the last Parliament, and I could go on, the message collectively that the current government has sent is that Canada is not open for business, that Canada is not open to investment in the energy sector. The consequences have been devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061614">We have seen $200 billion in projects cancelled since the government came to office. We have seen the rig count cut in half, down 50%. Capital investment is fleeing. Indeed, capital investment is down more than 50%. There are 120,000 people out of work in the energy sector since the current government came to office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061615"> We have seen, in terms of equity raised in 2018, a mere $650 million. Let us compare and contrast that to the United States. In 2018, equity and debt raised amounted to $19.4 billion. That is $19.4 billion in the United States and $650 million in Canada. In the United States, which is open to business and to investment in the energy industry, investment has skyrocketed, production has reached record levels, and for the first time in U.S. history, the United States is energy independent. So much for the sorry excuses across the way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061616">I heard one member say, “Industries could just move ahead with projects, but they are choosing not to.” It is not that they are choosing not to move ahead with projects; it is just that they are choosing to go elsewhere, to the United States and to other jurisdictions around the world that are saying they are open for business while the current government shuts down Canada's most vital sector of the economy. The number of companies that have divested from Canada in the energy sector, and are divesting from Canada as we speak, is too long to list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061617">In the face of that, what does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> not get? How much is it going to take? How many more projects are going to be cancelled? How much more investment is going to flee this country? How many more people have to be laid off? How many more people have to give up hope because they have been unemployed for the last several years? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061618">Let us talk about the social impact it has on families. They are devastated. The food bank in my constituency, each and every year that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been in office, has reached a new record level, year after year, thanks to this Prime Minister. It is time that this Prime Minister woke up. It is time that he put Canada first, and as a starting point to do that, he ought to immediately reverse his failed and destructive policies.</ParaText>

The writing was on the wall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061643">I speak of the real emergency. This House on June 17 of last year passed a motion which said the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061644">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canada is in a national climate emergency which requires, as a response, that Canada commit to meeting its national emissions target under the Paris Agreement and to making deeper reductions in line with the Agreement's objective of holding global warming below two degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061645">Now, this is an emergency. It is one that threatens not just our economy, but it certainly does threaten our economy. It does not just threaten Saanich—Gulf Islands or Alberta, and it does not just threaten Canada. It threatens the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061646">Members in this place should please take the time to read the special report on what 1.5°C looks like versus 2°C. This is a special report prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the request of all governments that negotiated the Paris Agreement in 2015, a request that was highly specific that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provide this specific information in time for the 2018 negotiations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061647">That emergency report should have sent shockwaves through every caucus in this place and right around the world, and certainly it did in many countries around the world, because it told us very clearly that holding to 1.5°C is not a political target. It is the only way we can ensure that our children will have a livable world. This is not future hypothetical children and future generations, but the children we know, our children, and for them to have a liveable world requires of us that we hold to no more warming than 1.5°C. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061648">It is a hard concept, average global temperature, in a country like Canada that goes from -30°C in the winter to +30°C in the summer, and so 1.5°C does not sound so very significant, but do not dismiss it. Understand that on this planet between today and 10,000 years ago when where we stand was under thousands of kilometres of ice, the difference in global average temperature was 5°C. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061649">What the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us in October 2018 was that holding to 1.5°C was not an ambitious target that we might do if we could get around to it. It told us very clearly that if we want our own children to have a livable planet in a hospitable biosphere, we must hold to 1.5°C. It further told us that it would be possible to do so, but it would require a global slashing of emissions by 45% all around the world by 2030. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061650">Now that the Liberals have given us this notion that we are going to get to net zero by 2050, it is clear that the current target which was left behind by a former minister of the environment, Leona Aglukkaq, in the administration of Stephen Harper, is the target we are talking about. The Liberals still have no plan to get to that target, and that target is approximately half of what we must do as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061651">Yes, we are in an emergency, because if we miss slashing by 50% the global emissions, and actually the IPCC advice is 45% against 2005 levels globally of carbon dioxide, then there are no do-overs. There are no second chances. We condemn future generations to an unlivable world in which human civilization may not make it to the end of the century. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061652">It is very clear that globally people were paying attention to this Teck Frontier decision, because Canada has a role to play in the world, and it should be one of leadership, but we remain laggards. Earlier tonight in debate, some hon. members were mentioning what the United States is doing. At this point, the United States, yes even under the Trump administration, is doing better at reducing greenhouse gases than Canada is. That is due to the actions of sub-national governments, states like California, New York and Texas. It is due to the actions of cities. Canada's record in this regard remains shameful, but we have a chance to redeem ourselves.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061658">I invite members to ponder that. There are 40 Nobel laureates specifically begging the Canadian government to act as if we understand we are in a climate emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061659">It has been said by Bill McKibben, who is one of the planet's leading climate activists and a brilliant author, that the first rule of holes is this: stop digging. Canada is in a very deep hole. We are far from our climate target, and that target itself needs to be doubled. What we cannot do here is add new greenhouse gas production. This project would have been enormous. If this project had gone ahead, it would have been twice the size of the city of Vancouver, at over 24,000 hectares. It would have, as the environmental assessment report found, done irreparable damage to the environment. It would have removed the forest, removed the muskeg, damaged wildlife and been damaging in many ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061660">There has never been, by the way, any environmental assessment process in this country that has ever said no to a project. Clearing these very rigorous environmental reviews that we keep hearing about in this place cannot be that hard, because no one has ever been turned down. No pipeline has ever been turned down by any environmental assessment process in this country. No oil sands mine has ever been turned down by any environmental assessment process in this country, no matter which government drafted the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061661">In this case, it is a project where even after all the environmental damage was catalogued, the panel found that the economic benefits of the project outweighed all the downsides. However, as we have heard in this House, the economics were kind of wobbly, because what Teck Frontier put forward as the precondition to this project being viable was that oil was selling at $95 a barrel. That is what they put in the report. That is what they relied upon. As we also commented in this place, there were not a lot of investors lining up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061662">I think the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of this country may have remarkable talents, and the reach of his powers may prove to be supernatural, but I have not seen it yet, so I really do not think the Prime Minister can be held responsible, as the Conservatives in this House would like us to hold him responsible, for the price of a barrel of oil globally. That is beyond the reach of his powers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="10">(2310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061663">The reality is that investors are moving away from fossil fuels all around the world. Just listing the companies and investors that have vacated the oil sands is edifying. These companies have left because they are concerned about something identified by the former governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark Carney. He refers to them as “stranded assets”. Investors are left with “unburnable carbon”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061664">If the fossil fuel business has something of a future ahead of it, it resembles a game we played as children, musical chairs. People start falling on the ground because the chairs are gone. Nobody wants to be left trying find the chair that is in the oil sands, one of the first places investors vacate because it is unburnable carbon and its stranded assets are very expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061665">Sweden's central bank left the oil sands and their investments in the oil sands, specifically stating that this province is the “highest in terms of carbon dioxide emissions”. Royal Dutch Shell has left the oil sands, stating specifically that it did not want stranded assets. ConocoPhillips, Marathon, Total and even Koch Industries have vacated the oil sands and the investments there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061666">Earlier, some of the speakers in this place referred to people concerned about climate change as fringe groups and eco-radicals, people without a really good grip on the finance sector. Perhaps members could imagine which eco-radical said the following on January 14: “We cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061667">That is a suggestion that we are on the path to human extinction. That quote did not come from Greenpeace or the Green Party. It came in a leaked document prepared by economists working for J.P. Morgan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061668">J.P. Morgan will be held forever on the wrong side of history for being responsible for having spent $75 billion investing in fossil fuels in recent years, but now recognizes that we cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes. In fact, it now announces that it will not invest anymore in new coal or drilling in the Arctic, but that is not really good enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061669">Goldman Sachs is the first big U.S. bank to rule out future financing of some forms of fossil fuels. It is not alone. BlackRock is one of the biggest investment companies in the world. Its CEO has said that climate is “almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise.” Climate is the number one issue its clients raise. It is moving toward divestment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061670">My favourite quote on this subject comes from Wall Street watcher Jim Cramer, who has a TV show that I have seen from time to time. It is called <I>Mad Money</I> and it is an investment program on CNBC. He says, “Big pension funds are saying listen, we're not going to own them anymore” and “I'm done with fossil fuels. They're done.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061671">Obviously Jim Cramer has been heavily influenced by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s brainwaves across the border to the United States. No, this whole notion that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is in any way at fault for Teck Frontier cancelling is absurd. The problem is that the Prime Minister cannot take any credit either, because the Government of Canada is still on the laggard side. We are still on the wrong side of history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061672">We could do what is required. In the Liberal platform, we have a very promising commitment to a climate accountability act. Where is it? When will we see it? This Parliament will not sit that long. It is a minority Parliament. Let us work on the things we can work on together. The majority of MPs in this House want a climate accountability act with five-year increments, not these targets that no one ever has to meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061673">On that note, 2020 is the year that Stephen Harper's climate promise falls due. It is this year. It was negotiated by the late and quite wonderful Hon. Jim Prentice. It was approved by a cabinet that includes Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. This year, 2020, is the year the Copenhagen target falls due, so by this year we should be emitting no more than roughly 600 megatonnes of greenhouse gases. The last figure we have is that we are at 716 or 717 megatonnes of greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="15">(2315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061674">Let us imagine we could magically get to Stephen Harper's target. Politicians in this country choose targets knowing that the due date will exceed their best-before date and somebody else will note that we have missed the target once again. That is why we need a climate accountability act that measures this in five-year increments, with an independent auditing function, so we know whether we are meeting our targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061675">The surest thing we can say is that Teck, as a company, had a lot of issues. It has had troubles with its mine in Chile. It had a lot of financial issues swirling around this. The business pages of this country were full of those stories, not of the Nobel laureates who warned us that to approve Teck Frontier would be an act close to criminality, when one considers the cost to our children, future generations and the peoples of the world if we continue as a country to boost our greenhouse gases rather than slash them. The business pages were full of speculation about the CEO of Teck, Don Lindsay, whose name has been raised in the House tonight more often than probably any CEO in Canadian history. He was clear: Teck had not done a feasibility study and was not sure it could go ahead. However, even a month ago he was saying we should give Teck the permit and he would see if it could raise the capital, if the price changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061676"> This project was never going to go ahead, but the Liberals have lost their chance for moral courage. They lost the chance to say they would never have approved this. This was, in the words of some Liberal MPs, an easy no. For God's sake, the Liberals need to stand for something while they have time in this place. They need to stand for future generations and put in place a climate target well before we get to Glasgow in November so that Canada can once again be in the lead. Canada as a climate leader is still possible to imagine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061677">I listened to the embarrassing response from the Liberals that it really was not their fault that Teck Frontier did not go ahead. They should stand up and say that they would never have approved it. Then we can believe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> might have a notion of being a climate leader.</ParaText>

We need to ensure that no workers in the fossil fuel sector feel insecure about their ability to pay their mortgage and take care of their kids. This is not about hurting fossil fuel workers. Those of us who want climate action want to ensure their transition is not abrupt, like what happened in Newfoundland when the cod fishery moratorium took place and 30,000 people lost their jobs overnight.

I want to pick up on her comments around stranded assets. She talked eloquently about the environmental risk we are facing in this crisis, but there is also an economic crisis facing Canada, coming at us like a freight train. That is those stranded assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061698"> Jeremy Rifkin, who was the keynote speaker at the Generation Energy meetings in Winnipeg a couple of years ago, one of the world's most respected energy economists, has come out recently with predictions that there will be widespread stranded assets in the fossil fuel industry not in 20 years, not in 10 years, but in eight years, in 2028, and that Canada would be one of the most severely affected countries in the world for these stranded assets, and why that really speaks to the desperate need we have for this just transition, for a green new deal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061700">The stranded assets issue of unburnable carbon is huge. The world of climate finance is gaining ground, with people like Mark Carney, who has now been named by the UN Secretary-General as a special envoy on climate finance around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061701"> Another source, again not someone one associates with eco-action, is Jeff Rubin, former chief economist with CIBC World Markets. He has said the same thing as Jeremy Rifkin from the U.S. Jeff Rubin said that when the stranded assets start emerging, when we have to see slashing of fossil fuel dependency, one of the first sectors and one of the first regions of fossil fuel production to close down and be left with bankruptcies is going to be the oil sands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061702">Therefore, we need to protect fossil fuel workers from our investing in a non-future for them. We have to invest in a real future for them, for their jobs, for their kids, and again, for a hospitable climate to support us all through to the end of this century. It is still a gamble whether we can pull it off, but if we pretend to be grief-stricken by a sensible decision to stop Teck Frontier, we have a long way to go to get to real climate action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061704">Allow me, in the late evening, to ask some dumb questions. I have two on which the member perhaps could educate me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061705"> First, are we actually facing a climate emergency, which is so important, that in a very short period of time this whole civilization may end? I am not a denier of the climate emergency. I am just ignorant, perhaps. Why is the Liberal government still renovating the Centre and East Blocks, which will take an estimated 15 years? How much carbon will that renovation generate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061706">During the discussion tonight, I heard a lot of heckling. I was also involved in asking members “Did you walk to Ottawa?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061707">The Conservatives believe in pragmatism. We believe in conserving the environment in a way that would actually make a difference. If it is so important, then why is the House not doing something about it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061708">Second, Canada's accounts for 1.7% of the global carbon emissions. If we shut down, if we depopulate Canada, it would make a meagre difference. China, India and the developing countries in the world would displace it in no time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061709">Would it not be better if Canada provided the technology for cleaner energy, like Coastal GasLink, so the rest of the world, like China, could benefit from it?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6061710">Mr. Speaker, first, what can we do in this place?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061711"> I have proposed in previous Parliaments to change our sitting hours. I have proposed what I call the Fort Mac work schedule. We would come here for three weeks at a time and work for five and a half days. This would cut down on the requirements of our job to travel back and forth to our riding. Three weeks here; three weeks in the constituency. That would dramatically reduce the cost of flights that are paid for by the people of Canada. Taxpayers cover our flights to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061712">On a personal basis, I have not taken a vacation that involved flying in the last 14 years. Where it is discretionary, I do whatever I can to avoid flying. The reality is that our society is hardwired to fossil fuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061713">Climate shaming and guilting people is not productive. We need to move with positive solutions that allow us to transition off our dependency on fossil fuels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061714">The second question related to Canada's meagre role in the world. I do not really understand. For someone who aspired to be Prime Minister, I know the <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> thought it was a selling point to argue that Canada was too meaningless to matter. I will never take that position.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061717">As much as I enjoy debating in the House, and I am really starting to like it, I have to say that this emergency debate took me by surprise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061718">On one side, we have the Bloc Québécois, which recognizes the climate emergency, believes in energy transition and ending fossil fuel subsidies, and wants to invest in clean, green energy. On the other, we have the Conservatives, who ignore the climate emergency and refuse to even acknowledge it because they see the world through an economic lens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061719"> If we carry on like this, we are going to hit a wall. Do I really need to remind everyone that Canada's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is one of the worst in the G20? Simply put, this government does not have a real plan, at least not a credible one. Its plan involves nothing more than flowery speeches by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a $12.6-billion pipeline expansion to export oil. Except that there will be nothing to export because the Frontier mine turned out not to be economically viable and will not be going ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061720">Basically, the Frontier project and Trans Mountain expansion have this in common: There is no money to be made. The Conservatives summoned us here tonight because Alberta is upset. They care only about the economy, and not at all about our planet or those who live on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061721">We in the Bloc Québécois are thrilled about Teck Resources' decision to withdraw its application for its oil sands development project. We are pleased and relieved, but we are still worried. We are pleased because we are thinking that if a company like Teck Resources has finally seen the light and can acknowledge the urgent need to reduce global carbon emissions and support measures to fight climate change, perhaps the Conservatives could see the light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061722">We are also relieved, but perhaps not as relieved as the government, which was really saved by the bell. Teck Resources made the decision that the government probably would never have had the courage to make. It is all very convenient. We in the Bloc Québécois are relieved because, as it turns out, the project will not be going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061723">The Bloc Québécois was the first party to call out the government on the approval of the Frontier mine and to denounce the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s doublespeak on the fight against climate change and his insistence on paying for dirty projects with taxpayers' money. I rose several times in the House and called on this government to drop the project because it was the right thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061724">Even if this project had been economically viable, it certainly was not environmentally sustainable. I said “even if” because, from what I understood from Teck Resources' decision, this project was far from being economically viable. However, that is not what I want to discuss here tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061725"> The letter Teck Resources sent to the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> states that Teck Resources firmly believes in the need to address the issue of climate change. It also believes that Canada has an important role to play globally as a supplier of natural resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061726">The Bloc Québécois thinks that the debate on the Frontier project withdrawal is an opportunity for Canada to clarify its position and policies on non-renewable energy development as part of the fight against climate change. The government should launch a public conversation and establish an official dialogue with partners from the provinces and Quebec on a fair transition and an exit plan for oil and gas. That is what we should be debating this evening, not the economic impact on only one part of the Canadian population. Greenhouse gas emissions know no borders. This concerns much more than a single province. <B /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061727">I think it is important to make the point that although we completely support Alberta's workers, we think the current issue is far more political than people are letting on right now. Instead of focusing on resentment, we should be working together on finding solutions for the future, to ensure a fair transition that will provide Albertans truly viable and sustainable economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061728">I also wonder about the relevance of this emergency debate because this was a decision made by a private company. Even the government, which seems to be rather divided among its own benches, did not debate the issue. As parliamentarians, should we debate every decision made by private Canadian companies? Since that is what led us here this evening, we will indulge in the debate, but in our own way.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="35">(2335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061729">Rather than seeing this decision as an economic defeat, we are seeing it as an opportunity to develop an Albertan and Canadian economy that is no longer dependent on fossil fuels, because, with all due respect, we believe that a healthy economy is a diversified economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061730">It is time to think of the future. There is nothing to indicate that the price of oil will significantly increase in the short- or medium-term. In any case, oil from the oil sands is among the mostly costly to produce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061731">Teck came to its own conclusions and made its decision. Perhaps the Conservatives and the Premier of Alberta could also come to some conclusions. They could start by recognizing that their economic model, their resource extraction model, is outdated. They could also start thinking of forward-looking solutions for their own people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061732">There is something rather ironic happening in the House this evening. While members of the House were getting all worked up defending projects that pollute, I attended a conference given earlier by Guy Dauncey on the climate emergency. What party had the most representatives at that conference? That was the Conservative Party. I am therefore wondering whether there are more Conservative members than we think who are more interested in the fight against climate change than in debates on non-existent projects that are the subject of non-decisions on the part of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061733">Mr. Dauncey believes that we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 65% by 2030 and by 100% by 2040. That is much more ambitious than the government's proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061734">For that to happen, we need to change our behaviour, our habits and our investments. If Teck's Frontier project had gone ahead, it would have released between 4.1 megatonnes and 6 megatonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub> per year for 40 years. The year 2067 is 17 years past Canada's net zero deadline. Those emission levels are clearly not compatible with Canada's GHG reduction targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061735">Other people always have to pay the price. Quebec's efforts to reduce GHG emissions are constantly being negated by the carbon footprint and environmentally irresponsible behaviour of western provinces such as Alberta. Canada would have to reduce its emissions by 77 megatonnes just to meet the Harper government's targets. Once again, Quebec is always having to pick up the slack for Alberta's increasing emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061736">Earlier, I had an opportunity to remind my colleague from Louis-Saint-Laurent about this, and I will remind everyone now: Between 1990 and 2017, Quebec's emissions fell by 8.7% while Alberta's rose by 58%. In 2017, Quebec's GHG emissions totalled 78.6 megatonnes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061737">The oil sands alone account for 87 megatonnes in 2020. That is more than Quebec's total emissions. The oil sands, a single industry, generate more pollution than every sector in Quebec, which has Canada's second-highest population. Nevertheless, some complain that we are not doing enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061738">By comparison, Ontario produces 158.7 megatonnes of GHG emissions, which is 22.1% of Canada's total emissions. Quebec is not alone. Ontario is making a real effort to reduce emissions. Nova Scotia, the Yukon, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have also reduced their emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061739">The figures show who is doing their part in Canada. I will certainly not win any friends by saying this, but I am not here to make friends. I am here to protect my constituents. They are worried about the future of their planet. I am here to stand up for them, and that is why they elected me. I will continue to stand up for them as long as someone is trying to force polluting projects like Frontier down our throats, in the midst of a climate crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061755">Mr. Speaker, a bit like my colleague, I too am wondering about the need to hold an emergency debate tonight regarding a decision made by an independent company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061756">To explain my point a little further, I would like to talk about a mine project. I would like to tell the story of a mine project dedicated to producing 100,000 barrels of oil a day. This mine is located 70 kilometres north of Fort McMurray. It is not the mine we are talking about today. It is a mine project that was cancelled in early 2014, when the price of oil first began to plummet. The production costs of that mine were estimated to be $11 billion. It became clear that the mine was going to become increasingly costly to run, because the production costs were increasing and the price of oil was dropping. The mine I am talking about is Joslyn North, which was cancelled in 2014, under the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061757">This leads me to wonder whether the Liberals are entirely to blame for everything happening right now. I will come back to the Liberals later. I will not forget them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061758">However, this does raise the point that the Conservatives may be creating a tempest in a teapot by going off in all directions, possibly in the hope of promoting their political interests. I do not know, nor do I claim to know, all of their beliefs or their objective in this. However, it seems to me that, when we look at this issue from a factual perspective, there are similarities between the two projects. The Teck Frontier project was a mine located 110 kilometres north of Fort McMurray that would have produced 260,000 barrels of oil. There seem to be similarities. The context is pretty much the same, with the drop in the price of oil and the increase in production costs. Don Lindsay mentioned that this context is what led to the project being abandoned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061759">It seems to me that the Conservatives are, unfortunately, trying to paint the Liberals in a greener light than they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061760">It is true that Alberta is currently facing its share of challenges and setbacks. Alberta has gotten a lot of bad news recently. Unfortunately, this evening, rather than finding constructive solutions to Alberta's long-term problems, the Conservatives are needlessly fanning the flames of Albertans' anger. This evening's debate will not bring back the Teck Frontier mining project, whether they want that or not, and I for one do not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061761">What is happening right now is that the Conservatives are oil junkies. They refuse to face the truth. Unfortunately for them, this is no longer the time of Ralph Klein's infamous prosperity cheques. Alberta is no longer swimming in money from oil royalties. The percentage of revenue generated from oil development in Alberta has been falling since the 1980s and reached a record low of 6% in 2009.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061762">Unfortunately, after seeing the writing on the wall, instead of following Norway's lead and using the additional money to overhaul its tax system and create a fund to facilitate a green transition, Alberta said, “Drill, baby, drill”. Instead of anticipating an inevitable problem and reviewing its tax system, Alberta tried to keep swimming in oil royalties by telling itself that it would just produce more oil to make more money, kind of like a junkie who slowly gets used to a harmful drug and needs more and more to satisfy their needs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="50">(2350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6061763">The problem is that the Liberals also shoulder some of the blame. The Liberals did not help Alberta with its addiction. Instead of helping Alberta get out of the oil and gas business and contribute to a real green transition, the Liberals contributed to its addiction, especially with the Trans Mountain project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061764">Donald Lindsay of Teck Resources mentioned three conditions that were essential for the operation of the Frontier mine project. There had to be a fairly high price per barrel, which the government has no control over. There had to be investor participation, which the government has no control over anymore. However, the last condition for moving forward with the Frontier mine project was the construction of a new pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061765">I find it odd that the Conservatives are accusing the Liberals of undermining the Frontier mine project when they contributed to one of the conditions for the project. It seems to me that they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061766">The government was responsible for the pipeline construction. It contributed to Alberta's dependence on oil. In 2017, 13 companies reserved an apportionment on the future Trans Mountain pipeline, which was supposed to transport 22,000 barrels a day. Teck Resources was one of the companies that reserved a pipeline apportionment. These agreements lasted 15 to 20 years. The government indirectly helped the Frontier mine project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061767">I find it sad that the Frontier mine project became an argument in favour of Trans Mountain, much like Trans Mountain became an argument for the implementation of Teck Frontier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061768">This may bring back some memories for some of the more seasoned members in the House who remember the popular Hygrade sausage ad that said, “More people eat them because they're fresher. They're fresher because more people eat them.” That perfectly describes the interdependence of Teck Frontier and Trans Mountain. The problem is that this massive sausage machine ultimately does nothing but force-feed us high meat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061769">In conclusion, I am happy for future generations that the Frontier mine project has been abandoned. The transition to green energy is inevitable and necessary. The problem is that the decision to abandon the project was not made by the government, and certainly not by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061770">I will take good news wherever I can get it. I hope that next time we will be the ones deciding not to move forward with this kind of project.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6061779">This is not the Bloc that I remember. I was a child of Bill 101 and a member from the west. I experienced the referendums and I saw an entire generation of young people leave Quebec to find work out west. I am a proud Albertan.

              <ParaText id="6061780">Is it now acceptable to the Bloc that the federal government interfere in provincial jurisdictions under the pretext of the environment and that it stop a project such as this one?

              <ParaText id="6061782">Mr. Speaker, my colleague seems to be forgetting that Alberta is still part of Canada and that Canada is still part of the world. If Alberta lived under a bell jar and it alone were affected by the impact of the megatonnes of CO2 that it produces, perhaps we would not hear that question as often and perhaps Alberta would be less happy to be living in these circumstances. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6061783">The matter must be analyzed in the context of a global crisis. The last time I checked, Canada is still a signatory to the Paris agreement, and as such, it is important that it meet its targets, that is, until Quebec is independent and able to meet them more quickly.</ParaText>
