              <ParaText id="6022227">The petitioners are quite concerned about the use of animals in cosmetic testing and the fact that Canada lags behind other countries that have already banned this practice. They call on Parliament to support Bill <Document DbId="8066175" Type="4">S-214</Document>, which unfortunately died on the Order Paper in the last Parliament. However, it is possible that it will be brought back. Therefore, it is urged that the House support that bill and ban the sale and/or manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada moving forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022238">Mr. Speaker, the government is going to have to answer to Quebec's 10,000 aluminum industry workers with regard to the new NAFTA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022239">This new agreement, which was negotiated in secret, cannot be described as a win. Once again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was unable to protect the workers of one of Quebec's iconic industries. Our nine aluminum smelters produce nearly three tonnes of primary aluminum, or 60% of the total North American production. Our expertise is recognized around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022240">Our industry, which produces the cleanest aluminum in the world, was sacrificed in favour of steel. The government is bragging about the fact that 70% of the materials used in auto manufacturing will now come from North America, when that percentage was already at 62.5%. However, although the agreement clearly indicates that all steel manufacturing processes must take place in one of the three countries for the steel to be considered North American, Ottawa, unlike the U.S. President, failed to obtain the same assurances for our aluminum. As a result, Mexico, which does not produce any aluminum and must therefore import 100% of its aluminum, will be able to continue buying cheaper aluminum from China and processing it before exporting it to the United States labelled as North American aluminum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022241">Over the course of summer 2019, we saw that the importation of aluminum wheels from China dropped in the United States but rose dramatically in Mexico. During that time, Mexico's exports of processed aluminum wheels to the United States more than doubled.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6022245">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the residents of Surrey Centre for once again putting their trust in me. It is truly an honour to be their voice in Ottawa. This moment was possible due to the hard work of my volunteers, who knocked on doors rain or shine, made countless phone calls, put up signs and spread the message of positive politics, all to ensure that I would continue to represent them in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022246">I would also not be standing here today if it were not for the unwavering support of my family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022247">I will always be accessible to the residents of Surrey Centre, and I look forward to working with each one of them for our community. I am certain that by working together we can ensure that Surrey Centre will continue to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022248">This past election proved that Canadians from coast to coast to coast want their representatives to work harder to tackle the issues that matter most. For Surrey Centre, I will continue to advocate for the middle class and those working hard to join it. I will continue to ensure that appropriate resources are available to those who keep our community safe and will support our climate target to continue leading this country in the right direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022249">Gun and gang violence, though on the decline, has been prevalent in Surrey for far too long. In January 2019 Surrey was given $7.5 million for the Surrey anti-gang family empowerment project, SAFE, the single largest investment in any city in Canada. SAFE was developed from the findings of the mayor's task force on gang violence, which I had the opportunity to sit on as a member. Over 4,500 at-risk youth will benefit from the project, which will work to help prevent youth from joining gangs and participating in other harmful activities by providing them with alternatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022250">An amazing initiative that came out of this program was the family and youth resource support team, FYRST. This early intervention and prevention initiative has resulted in 260 outreach visits and 58 client referrals in its first three months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022251">We have seen results and that is why we will continue to invest in cities to fight gang-related violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022252">However, this throne speech tackles harder policies. The government will crack down on gun crime, banning military-style assault rifles and taking steps to introduce a buy-back program. These are guns designed for only one task: to kill the most people in the least amount of time. They are not for hunting and are not for sport shooting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022253">I would support and encourage the City of Surrey if it chose to proceed with banning handguns or at least creating a bylaw to have handguns stored at gun ranges only. It is time that we prioritize the safety of our youth and make sure our citizens feel safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022254">Canadians are counting on us to be bold and ambitious, and to put the needs of the country before our own. With a willingness to collaborate we can do just that. We can deliver results and continue making life better for the people we serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022255">In 2015 we promised Canadians real change, and the throne speech will continue to build on the real progress we have made. We created one million new jobs, lifted 900,000 people out of poverty, including 300,000 children, reducing poverty by almost 20%. This is one of Canada's biggest social income changes in a four-year period ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022256">It is a privilege to be a part of the democratic process and I take my responsibility with great importance. Representing British Columbia may differ from representing other parts of Canada, but our priorities are the same: to move the country forward together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022257">The throne speech outlined a number of themes our government will focus on. We all want equal opportunities and have common goals, whether on keeping our communities safe, on affordability or on climate change. My responsibility to my constituents in Surrey Centre is to deliver real impactful results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022258">The throne speech has put emphasis on keeping Canadians safe, which is a high priority for the residents of Surrey Centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022259">I have some of the most hard-working residents in the country. When I knocked on doors, I kept hearing concerns about affordability, whether on housing, schooling or being able to afford day-to-day activities. It was time a government put hard-working Canadians at its forefront.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022260">In 2015, as soon as we were elected, we raised taxes on the wealthy and lowered taxes for the middle class. We created a tax-free Canada child benefit to help families with the cost of raising their children.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022261">In Surrey Centre, the Canada child benefit has helped over 28,000 families since 2016, with the amount of payments to our riding totalling over $208 million. Since the introduction of this historic benefit, nine out of 10 families have been receiving more money every month for groceries, school supplies, sports and other extracurricular activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022262">The Canada child benefit was then increased for a second time to keep up with the cost of living. Canada's poverty rate is at its lowest level in Canadian history, and thanks to the CCB, nearly 300,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. We know when Canadians have more money in their pockets, we build stronger communities, create more jobs and continue to grow a stronger economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022263">I am glad that Canadians re-elected a government that would put their needs first. That is why we are repeating this in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022264">Our government has taken steps to once again amend the Income Tax Act to lower taxes for the middle class and people working to join it. This could save a single person almost $300 a year and provide a couple or a family close to $600 a year in savings. Nearly 1.1 million more Canadians would no longer pay federal income tax at all. This would help nearly 20 million Canadians save hundreds of dollars a year in taxes once it is fully rolled out in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022265">We are moving forward with more help for the middle class and people working hard to join it, because that is exactly what Canadians elected us to do. In the past four years, over one million new jobs were created and unemployment dropped to its lowest rate since records have been kept.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022266">We know how important it is to ensure that we create a better nation for our youth, and that is why we are prioritizing climate change. The fight against climate change and further environmental protection starts now. The government will preserve Canada's natural legacy, protecting 25% of our land and 25% of our oceans by 2025. We are helping to make energy-efficient homes more affordable and are introducing measures to build clean, efficient and affordable communities. We want to make it easier for people to choose zero-emission vehicles, work to make clean and affordable power available in every Canadian community, work with businesses to make Canada the best place to start and grow a clean-technology company and provide help for people displaced by climate-related disasters. Simple tasks such as reducing plastic pollution and using nature-based solutions, including planting two billion trees, can help clean the air and make our communities greener. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022267">We know that the environment and the economy can go hand in hand. While the government creates strong action to fight climate change, it will prioritize Canadian resources to new markets and offer unwavering support to the hard-working women and men in Canada's natural resource sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022268">The throne speech touched on very important, time-sensitive issues: keeping our streets safe, making life more affordable for Canadians and preserving the future of our planet for the next generation. I am truly honoured to be standing here today with a progressive government that prioritizes these issues and many more that help Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

A lot of people are employed in the ocean sector. They are fisher people and others who are not getting the same opportunities. There is no comprehensive plan to address the challenges that wild salmon and other sea life are experiencing in our riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022271">Madam Speaker, our environment and oceans are a vital source of food, productivity and work for thousands of Canadians, especially on the coast of British Columbia. The government's first responsibility is to protect the oceans so we can have an abundant fish stock that reproduces itself and comes back year after year. If we do not protect the oceans, salmon and sockeye stocks will not return again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022272">That is why we are protecting 25% of our coast and making sure there is an abundant food supply, particularly from the oceans, for years and generations to come.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6022281">Madam Speaker, I want to start by mentioning that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="252581" Type="2">Salaberry—Suroît</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022282"> As Bloc Québécois critic for agriculture, agri-food and supply management, I will be talking about agriculture today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022283">We were pleased to see that the compensation that had been promised to dairy farmers before the election campaign was included in the Speech from the Throne. The government can be assured of our full co-operation for the follow-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022284">However, I want to point out to the government that much of the compensation promised when the trade deals were signed has failed to materialize. Chicken, turkey, hatching egg and table egg farming are not covered, and no agreement has been reached yet between those farmers and the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022285">We therefore call on the government to act diligently and as swiftly as possible to resolve this matter. It must make good on all of its commitments and promises of compensation. The financial health of our farming businesses depends on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022286">There was also no agreement for the dairy processing sector. Not only has no compensation been determined for that sector, but also all the contingency plans, such as import permits, have yet to be definitively established. We have one concern about that particular issue. Regarding the agreement with Europe, we were told that a permanent determination of import licences would be announced in January. We have no other information at the moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022287">Quotas were provisionally set at 55% for retailers and 45% for processors. However, it seems that this ratio is harmful to Quebec's industry. Retailers are taking advantage of the situation to import substantial amounts of cheese, even though the same cheeses are produced here at good prices. Those products are replacing local products on store shelves and causing Quebec producers to lose out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022288">Accordingly, for the optimal benefit of our local production, that ratio must be amended immediately, with the processors' share increased significantly. When processors are licence holders, they import products that complement the local production, which makes sense. This means less competition for our local producers. This distribution is also better for consumers, who will have access to a broader range of products. It is a win-win.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022289">Therefore, today I am asking about the government's intentions in this regard. Producers, processors, consumers and we, the members, need a clear answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022290">That is what I wanted to say about compensation. Although the compensation is necessary and our agricultural producers now want it, it is not their preferred option. Quebec farmers are proud people. They do not want government handouts. What they want is to work. What they need to do that, now more than ever, is for the government to take action and to put in place permanent and unequivocal protections for the supply management system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022291">We will not be satisfied this time with a commitment or a simple motion. What we want is legislation that protects our supply management system so that it will never again be amputated. This system is unparalleled in the world. It results in a quality product, a stable price and a decent standard of living for our producers. This system should not be cut up into pieces. Instead, we should maintain it and promote it abroad. This system works well. Furthermore, it requires no government subsidies. It is surreal to see this innovative system be gradually replaced by a system of compensation, in essence by subsidies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022292">The Bloc Québécois wants a firm commitment from this government. Is the government prepared to step up and protect the way we manage our agricultural sector?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022293">NDP members have said that they will support our efforts. Conservative members have been talking a lot about agriculture since we returned, and the opposition leader has spoken in favour of our supply management system in the past. I would imagine, or at least I would hope, that his party will also support our request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022294">How about the government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022295">I listened carefully to the statement the minister made on December 3 at the Union des producteurs agricoles congress in Quebec City. The minister was trying to reassure farmers under supply management and guarantee that his government would protect the system and not give away any new market shares. I can only assume that the government will agree to enact legislation that will truly protect our supply management system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022296">If that is indeed the case, we will have a very strong consensus in the House and our supply management system will forever be off the table in future international negotiations. This is of vital importance. Mercosur negotiations and the likelihood of Brexit are forcing us to move faster. I am urging all MPs to act swiftly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022297">I would also like to talk about the recent propane crisis, which had a very negative impact on the agricultural sector. After a year of terrible weather, a late, rainy spring and early snows and winter, the sector was hit by the CN strike. The 2019 season was bad enough for grain producers, and all those factors made it even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022298">The propane supply was interrupted from day one. The company gave no notice. Producers were left with silos full of wet grain they could not dry and snowy fields they could not harvest. They had no choice but to watch the grain rot in the fields because they did not have fuel to dry it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022299">This situation is unacceptable. The Bloc Québécois called for action from the start. We wanted CN to make shipping propane a priority so farmers would get the supply they need. The service interruption doomed many crops.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022300">According to Mr. Overbeek, the president of Producteurs de grain du Québec, many businesses will not make it through 2019. On top of that, when rail service resumed, farmers were subject to an unconscionable increase in the cost of propane. It is disgusting to see one industry profit while another suffers. On Saturday, farmers in Saint-Barthélemy, in Berthier—Maskinongé, told me about all of the problems they have faced this year and struggled to control their emotions. Some are still trying to salvage some of the grain by harvesting it at night, because the conditions are better. A number of them have given up. Our grain farmers need a sign. They need real action to know that their elected officials support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022301">The federal government has little control over the price of propane. However, we must take action when possible. In the short term, we are talking about compensation. Will the federal government commit to follow the Government of Quebec's lead and show our farmers some extraordinary support, in light of the exceptional crisis they have just experienced?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022302">Long-term action is needed as well. Is the government prepared to reflect on how it can guarantee farmers a basic energy supply? We in the Bloc Québécois believe that what our farmers went through was unacceptable and must never happen again. We need to take steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022303">The subject of our relations with China has come up in this debate. In that case too, farmers are getting shafted. Pork exports have recovered, but our farmers suffered major losses they will have to be compensated for. We also believe that an emergency fund should be established to support any farm sector that is affected by future diplomatic crises. Our canola farmers have also been hit hard. We need to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022304">We must bear in mind that other countries do not hesitate to support their farmers. That gives foreign farmers an unfair advantage over ours. We should also ask ourselves what kind of support we can offer to our cattle farmers. With regard to the transportation standards that are set to take effect in February, the minister has announced a two-year delay before penalties are enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022305">We should use that time to think about how we can help our farmers and establish reasonable standards that do not jeopardize our agriculture industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022306">There were a few other topics I wanted to address, but I will wind up my remarks now and come back to them in my answers. The agriculture industry has been under a lot of strain over the past few years. Rural folks need help and recognition. They need us. We must never forget that agriculture not only provides our food supply and our food sovereignty, in other words, our security, but also ensures the full, dynamic use of our land.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022311">We face many local challenges. Berthier—Maskinongé is an enormous agricultural riding that is home to various types of products, some of which are supply managed. In the current context, grain farmers are struggling with psychological distress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022312">A few weeks ago I attended a fundraising dinner marking the 90th anniversary of the UPA in the Lanaudière area. The purpose of the event was to raise money to create a farm outreach program. To have reached the point where we need someone to meet with people on their turf, on their farms, to listen to their concerns is a sign that farmers are extremely distressed. This is also a very important aspect that must receive our support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022314">Like the member for <Affiliation DbId="252905" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation>, I am glad to hear this discussion of agriculture. My riding has a lot of agriculture. I live in a very dry, hot part of the country, at least in summer, and we are very concerned about climate change. When I look at the Speech from the Throne in terms of climate action, there are some nice words but there is no mention of real accountability.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022317">We quite agree with the idea that we need to take swift and meaningful action to fight climate change. Climate change is having an impact on our farmers year after year, and things are only getting worse. Think of the flooding in 2017 and 2019. The media talked a lot about residents living along the river who had to abandon or renovate their homes, but we also need to consider the farm land that was flooded, making it impossible for farmers to plant crops there. When nothing is planted, nothing can be harvested. That is simple logic. We therefore need to take swift and meaningful action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022318">The Bloc Québécois thinks that, at minimum, the greenhouse gas reduction targets should be set based on the Paris agreement targets. We also think that those targets should be made legally enforceable so that the government is required to meet them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022319">In the past, we have seen governments make commitments, announce good news and give nice speeches on television. However, after a few months, they all announced that the targets would not be met. We have even seen some governments withdraw from a signed agreement. We think that embarrasses Canada on the world stage and should not be happening. It is high time we took action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022320">I am very pleased to hear that my NDP colleagues agree with us that we need to take swift action on climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022321">Madam Speaker, congratulations to you. It is always a pleasure to see a female parliamentarian occupy the Speaker's chair, and it is my sincere wish to one day see you fully serve as Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022322">As this is the first time I rise, I want to thank the people of Salaberry—Suroît for putting their faith in me on October 21. It truly warmed my heart. I am returning to the House after an eight-year absence. I am pleased and honoured to have the confidence of the people of my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022323">Obviously, an election campaign like the one we just went through requires a lot of energy, but most of all it requires being surrounded by good people. I was surrounded by very passionate supporters and volunteers. I would like to name one who has been by my side since the beginning, in 2006. Louise Laître was my campaign manager and deserves to be applauded for her passionate commitment to Quebec and the riding of Salaberry—Suroît.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022324">I also want to thank my three daughters, Audrée, Jade and Florence. Florence, my third daughter, is 23 and ran all my communications during the election campaign. She does exceptional work and I am very proud of her. Today, she has an interview, and I hope that the employer will hire her because she is the best. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022325">I would also like to thank my spouse, who already knows what it is like to be the spouse of an MP. He agreed once more to be my partner and accomplice and to support my dream to be an MP again. He knows the sacrifices that have to be made in our personal and family lives and our relationship. After 35 years, he again committed to working with me and he placed his full trust in me. I want to publicly thank him for being at my side and for supporting my passion, because he deserves it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022326">Today, I want to talk about what I really care about, seniors and health. I am a social worker by training and I have also worked in the Quebec public health network. In recent years, I was a manager at a CLSC and I coordinated housing for seniors. These seniors are less fortunate, poorer and weaker than most or are in precarious health. Today, in my speech in reply to the throne speech, I will focus on seniors and health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022327">Front-line workers in a community can quickly and clearly see what the people need. I work as part of a team, in collaboration with community workers. The community needs to act in response to a given social or health problem. All of the stakeholders need to examine the problem and think about a solution, which will be the best possible solution since it is chosen by the people involved. The evidence shows that when solutions are found at the grassroots level, they are better able to address a community's needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022328">Imagine my surprise when I read in the throne speech that the government wants to give money to the provinces, provided that they hire family doctors and offer mental health services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022329">I have to wonder what the Government of Canada, here in Ottawa, knows about the needs of Quebeckers in my community. What does it truly know about our needs? Why will it not go along with what Quebec and the provinces are calling for and increase transfers by 5.2%? This would allow the provinces and Quebec to tailor their services to the specific needs of their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022330">These needs are not all the same; some are greater than others. There are community groups in my region that look after all mental health problems. I would like to single out one in particular, Le Pont du Suroît.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022331">The director, Marc André Bédard, is a fantastic guy, a nurse who has dedicated his career to the public realm and saw the little cracks in the system. He therefore decided to spend most of his career working for a community group that supports the loved ones of people with mental health problems. His work is so highly regarded that he gives talks throughout Quebec and indeed around the world. He created an innovative approach, and the Quebec minister of health thought it was so good that he decided to fund the group. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022332">However, just because this group works well in Quebec and in my community does not mean it will work elsewhere. The one who is best suited to determine what a community needs is Quebec's health minister, who can consult local stakeholders, create programs and pay for them. The needs are increasing at this time, but the money is in Ottawa and is not being transferred to the provinces. I see it as a matter of respecting areas of Quebec and provincial jurisdiction. What is being asked is that Ottawa transfer the money to the Government of Quebec, which is the authority that really knows where investments are needed to adequately meet the needs of its communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022333">I do not know what to make of this desire to centralize provincial jurisdictional powers in Ottawa. I am talking about the government, but the NDP also keeps proposing all kinds of national strategies that blatantly infringe on provincial jurisdictions. I see this as a lack of trust. The government is essentially saying that the provinces are not inventive or smart enough to create programs that address the real needs in their communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022334">The government would rather tell the provinces what to do with their money. The government thinks it knows what works and that it is in the best position to determine that. This makes me even more passionate and reinforces my vision of Quebec as its own country. If Quebec were to be in control of its own destiny and hold on to the money it sends to Ottawa, it would invest that money into good programs, since Quebec knows what is good for its communities. Although Quebec knows what is needed right now, it lacks the means to take action. I urge my colleagues opposite to respect the provincial premiers' demands for increased health transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022335">Seniors in our communities are really suffering. They need home support and higher incomes to cover the rising cost of prescription drugs and housing. Right now, old age security is not enough. Anyone who gets sick and has to rely on the guaranteed income supplement and old age security will have a hard time paying for housing and any services they might need. Seniors who worked their whole lives in the expectation of a dignified retirement should not have to worry about being able to pay for those services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022336">One way to solve the problem is to enhance the guaranteed income supplement and old age security. The Bloc Québécois wants the government to increase old age security for people 65 and over and allow people who lose a loved one to collect the guaranteed income supplement for three months following their loved one's death. The death of a loved one is traumatic enough as it is. If those left behind are afraid they will not be able to pay their rent, that is even worse. We are asking the government to show some compassion and increase the guaranteed income supplement and old age security for seniors 65 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022337">In closing, I call on the government to respect areas that fall under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces and increase provincial health transfers by 5.2%. The government needs to let the provinces do what they do best: manage their own issues and find their own solutions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022356">The previous Liberal government, which I was proud to be a part of, did more than any prior government for the environment.

              <ParaText id="6022363">Another reason I support the Speech from the Throne is for its focus on strengthening the middle class. Our government has a goal of making life more affordable for Canadians. The personal income tax exemption is being raised to $15,000 so that Canadians can do more with their money, whether that is putting more money into their savings accounts or being able to afford better-quality food on their table for their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022364">When I was growing up, my parents did not have a lot of money. My father was my family's only breadwinner, and sometimes it was tough, but he and my mom made up for it by giving us an amazing family experience and ensuring that we took part in extracurricular activities. They wanted to give us a good life and tried hard to do so. However, I began working at the age of 15 in order to pay for my personal expenses, because I did not want to be a burden on my parents. They made sure that there was a roof over my head and healthy food on the table every single day, but I felt that if I wanted more, it was up to me to earn some money. My mom told me to save half of every paycheque so that I could pay for my university tuition one day. If I wanted a cellphone, I had to pay my own bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022365"> Let me say that kids who know that their parents are going through financial struggles feel it. It is a heavy weight to carry. I know this because I taught in public schools on the Island of Montreal, and kids whose families did not have an easy time knew not to ask their parents for things that they could not afford.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022366"> Our government is going to make a real difference in situations such as these by cutting cellphone and wireless bills by 25%, which will help middle-class families in particular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022367">We also plan to help students so that they all have the opportunity to have a quality post-secondary education, no matter their family's socio-economic status. Students will not have to pay back their student loan until they find full-time employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022368">The government will also implement measures to reduce the number of homeless people by investing in affordable housing. During our last term, we reduced poverty by improving the situation of 900,000 Canadians through the Canada child benefit. We will continue to make these crucial investments for the people that need them most. </ParaText>

I want to point out that, as a feminist, I am proud of the fact that our government took seriously the challenges faced by women in our last term of office. I am also proud that the throne speech referred to the gender-based violence strategy. We will do more to fight violence against women and the LGBTQ2 community.</ParaText>

We will ban military-style assault rifles like the one used at École Polytechnique, and we will introduce a buyback program. While we know that this is only the beginning and a that lot more needs to be done in order to completely eliminate gun violence, this is an important step in the right direction.</ParaText>

That is in the throne speech, which is fine. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022388">Madam Speaker, congratulations on your appointment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022389">It is a pleasure to rise for the first time in this 43rd Parliament. Before I turn to the Speech from the Throne, I would like to take a moment to thank the people of Scarborough Centre for returning me to this place. They have put their trust in me to continue to be their strong voice in Ottawa. I am so grateful for their confidence and support. None of us would be here without our dedicated supporters and volunteers. I have an amazing team and I would like to thank team Salma for its countless hours of hard work over these past months and years. I also want to thank my family, my husband Salman, and my boys Umaid and Usman, for their love and support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022390">I am proud to have received a strong mandate from the people of Scarborough Centre to fight for their values, hopes and dreams in this place. They have shared with me their struggles, their hopes for the future and the challenges their families are facing. It is their priorities I bring to this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022391">I also recognize that in a minority parliament it is ever more important that we all work together. No one has a monopoly on good ideas. I am ready to work with those who share the values, hopes and dreams of the people of Scarborough Centre. We are a riding of Canadians by birth and Canadians by choice. Many of us come from somewhere else and have chosen to make Scarborough our home. We are a community of senior citizens and young families. We are a community of Canadians working hard to join the middle class. They are concerned about being able to stretch each paycheque to the end of the month. They worry about the ever-rising cost of housing. They lay awake worrying if they can provide a better future for their children. They work hard and are looking for a little help to get ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022392">That is what I was looking for as I listened to the Speech from the Throne. I was pleased to hear some of the priorities of my constituents addressed in the speech. That a tax cut that will deliver a real benefit to those families working hard to join the middle class will be the first order of business for this government was welcome news for the families of Scarborough Centre. Rather than handouts to millionaires, we know that putting more money into the pockets of families working hard to join the middle class is money that will be invested back into the economy. It means new clothes for going back to school. It means healthier groceries going into kids' lunch bags. It is an investment that will support not only families but also local jobs and economies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022393">The throne speech mentioned the historic reductions in poverty achieved by the government in its last mandate. Nearly 900,000 Canadians were lifted out of poverty, many of them children, thanks to programs like the Canada child benefit. That is a program we are committed to strengthening even more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022394">One of the many families in Scarborough benefiting from the Canada child benefit is the Tareen family. Thanks to the CCB, Lenna and Najib are able to provide healthy food for their children, Abdullah, Ahmed Yasin and Habibullah. They can take them on educational outings and allow them to participate in more activities in school. We are proud of that record, but I know this government will be the first to admit there is still more work to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022395">Probably the biggest expense that families in Scarborough face is housing. There is a serious lack of supply. What housing is available is often old, overpriced and inadequate to meet the needs of the average Scarborough family. Therefore, I am pleased to hear that the government reaffirmed its commitment to the national housing strategy and to making continued investments in affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022396">Programs like the first-time home buyer incentive are already making a difference. The money already being invested in Toronto community housing is funding long-overdue renovations in community housing facilities in Scarborough and across Toronto. Moving forward with the Canada housing benefit in the coming year will help many families who are struggling with the rising rents they have to pay.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022397">In this Parliament, I will be a voice for continued investment in affordable housing. As well, we must ramp up our investment as fast as our provincial and municipal partners can build the capacity to make new projects shovel-ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022398">Another key priority for my constituents is community safety. Too often the sound of gunshots echo through our neighbourhoods. Too many of my constituents have lost loved ones or know a family who has lost loved ones to senseless violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022399">I recently attended a community safety meeting in an apartment complex where a family had lost a son in a shooting. Nothing can compare to the grief of a mother who has lost her child. The community came together to grieve and to discuss meaningful action to end these acts of violence. In Scarborough, in Canada, no one should feel unsafe walking the streets of their community. The time has come for serious action to combat gun violence and the gang activity that fuels it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022400">While I supported the common sense gun crime legislation passed in the last Parliament, it is long past time to go further. This is why I fully support the commitment in this throne speech to ban military-style assault rifles and introduce a buyback program. Too many of these weapons have been involved in mass shootings in Canada and around the world. Outside the military, they serve no legitimate purpose. These weapons are not designed to hunt deer. They are designed to kill people, as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022401"> I understand the need for a rifle on a farm for protection, and I respect the hunting culture practised in many communities, but military-style assault rifles do not belong in our communities. The safety of our children must come first. It is time to get these guns off the streets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022402">I also welcome the commitment to work with municipalities and communities that want to ban handguns. This is something that I have heard loud and clear from my constituents, and something that the mayor of Toronto and Toronto council have asked for. While these measures alone will not eliminate gun crime, the evidence from jurisdictions around the world shows that it will make a big difference. We owe it to our children to do everything we can. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022403">We must also continue to invest in measures to stop the flow of illegal guns at our borders. As important as getting guns off the streets is, the most important thing we can do to ensure safer communities is to show our youth that better is possible for them. We need to show them that they have opportunities to grow and prosper and succeed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022404">During its last mandate, our government made significant investments in programs to tackle youth gang violence. I hear from my constituents, especially the mothers, how important this is. As the mother of two sons myself, in this Parliament I will be a voice for further investments in our next generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022405">Those are some of the highlights for my constituents, but other priorities of Scarborough Centre are also reflected in this Speech from the Throne. My constituents know that climate change is a real and serious threat, and they want us to do more to achieve our emissions reduction targets, ban plastics and get to net-zero emissions by 2050. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022406">My constituents know we have a moral obligation to Canada's indigenous people to walk the road of reconciliation together. That means eliminating all remaining boil water advisories, enshrining the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in legislation and so much more. They believe that every Canadian should be able to get a family doctor much more easily, and that universal pharmacare is the next natural evolution of the public health care system of which all Canadians are justifiably proud. As well, they want Canada to continue to be a voice for human rights and the freedom of all people, both at home and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022407">Historically, minority parliaments have been some of the most productive in Canadian history, but that is only possible if we park our egos at the door and work to find common ground. I look forward—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022432">As I rise in the House of Commons for the first time, it is my honour, on behalf of the residents of Essex, to represent each corner of my riding, from Lakeshore to Amherstburg, from Essex to Kingsville, from LaSalle and everywhere in between. I am humbled to represent my great riding. I thank each and every person for putting their trust in me. I have been working and will continue to work hard for them in Essex, as well as in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022433">First and foremost, I must give thanks to my Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ, for the opportunity to stand here as the member of Parliament for Essex. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022434">On the eve of the writ being dropped, I had an unfortunate accident that was scary, to say the least, but many stitches later and amazing health care from the doctors and front-line nursing staff at the Erie Shores HealthCare hospital, along with prayers from many and a long phone call from <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> Andrew Scheer while I was in the hospital that evening, I was discharged. It is not often that a candidate gets a call from his party leader on the eve of an election. This speaks directly to Mr. Scheer's caring character and concern for others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022435">Members of my Conservative family came out in full force and offered to help my campaign in whatever way they could. As I knew, my Conservative family is a caring, thoughtful and deep-rooted family, ready for the call to action when someone is in need. For this, I need to thank all of my colleagues for their support during this difficult time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022436">There are so many people I need to thank. I thank my wife Allison, the love of my life, my best friend and supporter, for her sacrifice, her smile, her dedication and trust. I love her dearly. My children Jagger, Cody and Faith should remember that they are only handcuffed by the boundaries that they place upon themselves. Each and every one of them is unique and I am proud to be their father and excited for their future. I thank my amazing parents, Kim and Helen Lewis, and my brothers, Jeff and Kim, for being positive influences in my life and helping me to be the person I am today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022437">I thank my most amazing volunteer election team, my campaign manager and those who helped spread the positive Conservative message at 43,000 doors across Essex, those who worked tirelessly and always with a positive attitude and great big smiles. From the bottom of my heart, I thank them. I also thank my staff members, the people who truly get things done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022438">I am honoured to have served alongside my brothers and sisters of the Kingsville Fire Department for seven and a half years. Serving my community is the very reason that I stand here today. To each and every one of them who had my back and looked over my shoulder in the face of danger, I thank them. To my dear friend, Captain Mark Rankin, I respect him enormously and thank him dearly for his friendship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022439">I would be remiss not to thank a few other folks, too many to name, but vital to recognize. To my hockey coaches, my baseball coaches, my teachers, my mentors and my friends, as well as those who have influenced my life and given me opportunities along the way, I thank them. Mrs. Robinet, my grade school teacher, and Mr. Robert Peterson, who took me under his wing during my term as Kingsville councillor, have both touched me deeply and I am better because of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022440">I stand here today to represent the great folks of Essex. It is with them in mind that I must focus for a moment on the cultural, geographical and economic riches of my riding of Essex. Essex is famous for its farming and agricultural communities. The greenhouse industry is also a big part of its economy, growing a variety of produce and now expanding into the cannabis industry as well. There are wineries and microbreweries. I was proud to see our local wine being served here in Ottawa just last week. There is cutting-edge technology for development, as well as incredible training at St. Clair College, training our future generation of skilled trades workers. There are salt mines and dairy farms, commercial fishing and the most talented auto workers and steelworkers in the country. Geographically, Essex is among the warmest ridings in the country, attracting tourists from around the world to enjoy its climate, waterways and the many festivals the region has to offer. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022441">I stand with confidence when I say that Essex is truly a microcosm of Canada. I would like to include in my speech two issues that are close to my heart and to the hearts of the good folks of Essex.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022442">First, our nation and my riding are built upon the hard-working people and entrepreneurs of our small businesses. These are the people with great hopes and dreams. They are often willing to mortgage everything, short of their children, to ensure that they are serving their local communities, creating jobs and opportunities, feeding the mouths of families and donating to the many charities that, especially at this time of year, come knocking on their door for donations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022443">These individuals are freedom fighters. They take all the risk, invest the capital, are directly responsible for their success versus their failure and do not receive benefits like many of us do. They often have to borrow money from family members to get their businesses started, as banks are reluctant to lend money to set up a business. They spend long hours creating jobs for Canadian families. These businesses are the economic engines of Canada and when they fail, people lose the ability to feed their families. They pour their blood, sweat and tears into their companies as they are proud of what they do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022444">What is more, they drown in government regulation and tax. I spoke recently to a gentleman in my riding who was working on his day off. It happened to be a Sunday and he was working very long hours to fill out the tax forms as he could not afford to pay an accountant to do it for him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022445">Being a small business owner myself, I understand the struggles that these people face each day. I see nothing in the Speech from the Throne to address these issues or to support our small businesses. Conservatives understand what the issues are and we thank our small businesses for what they bring to Canada. We will certainly continue to stand up for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022446"> Second, I stand in the House as a proud hunter, angler and legal firearm owner. In fact, as an outfitter, firearms are one of the tools of my job. Like many Canadians, I enjoy sport shooting and target shooting. I am not a criminal nor have I ever had a criminal record. Like many Canadians, I have had many background checks and spent a lot money to enjoy my right as a legal firearm owner. Now the government is looking to penalize and persecute me for a crime I did not commit. I am both a legal handgun owner and a member of the House of Commons and I find it appalling that we are going down the same path that has cost taxpayers billions of dollars in the past with zero results. Criminals and gang members are not going to give up their guns. Mayors across Canada have said that this is simply not the answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022447">The answer is giving our border guards and law enforcement officers the tools and funding they need to combat illegal smuggling, gang violence and criminals. Getting serious on crime and giving longer prison sentences is the answer. A buyback program and banning handguns will have absolutely no positive effect to reduce violent crime. When will the government stop penalizing the law-abiding gun owners? The nonsense needs to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022448">I was elected to represent the great people of Essex, to defend their rights as Canadians and help create an environment for families and businesses to flourish. Members of Parliament have been given a sacred trust to do all we can to serve the people who sent us to Ottawa to represent their hopes, dreams and aspirations for themselves, their loved ones and their communities. We have a great challenge and great opportunities ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022449">I look forward to the work I can do to make changes for Canada and my riding of Essex. It is my deepest desire to do all I can to leave this world a better place than I found it.</ParaText>

What this is really about is getting rid of weapons that are out there that are designed to inflict the maximum amount of human damage as quickly as possible.

              <ParaText id="6022459">Madam Speaker, a Mini-14, which is the gun that was used at École Polytechnique, is a .223 calibre. The gun itself is not going to do any more harm than a typical Winchester or a Browning .223 calibre. It is about the actual number of shots that are in this gun. With a Mini-14, one can hunt predators, coyotes as an example, with a clip of five. People do it all day long. We could have the same case against all of our firearms, including shotguns, but, no, the Liberals want to talk about it being okay for hunters to have these guns, they just want to get rid of the most wicked ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022460">The truth of the matter is that this could happen with any type of firearm. Banning handguns is absolutely not the answer, because the criminals will never give them back.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022461">Madam Speaker, I get the impression that the Liberal focus, when it comes to firearms, is on scary-looking weapons, weapons that look from the outside to have the same aesthetic presentation as an assault weapon. As a practical matter, it is also my understanding that the military, in particular the U.S. military, uses shotguns for close-range combat because they are just as effective, unfortunately, against humans as they are against animals. This suggests that if we are trying to deal responsibly with weapons that have the potential to harm humans, we have to look beyond aesthetic considerations and talk in terms of practicalities, as opposed to focusing on the fears of those who do not fully understand the issue.</ParaText>

As a matter of fact, our police officers carry shotguns, many of them right there in their vehicles. Why would they do that? Why would we take a shotgun to a riot as opposed to a Mini-14? It is because a lot more damage can be done at very close range, and one does not have to aim, just point.</ParaText>

If I have one piece of advice for my new colleagues here, it is that while the work we do here is important, if they do not take care of themselves and do not work just as hard on their relationships with their family and friends, then what we do really has no meaning. It is so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022470">Last but not least, and why I am here today, I want to talk about my riding of Cariboo—Prince George and its residents.

I will work tirelessly to represent them, to bring their voices to Ottawa and ensure they are represented in our nation's capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022471">However, this election was probably one of the most divisive times I have faced in recent years. It was probably the ugliest six weeks in my four years of being elected. My family was personally attacked, which speaks to the divisiveness within our country. We did not talk about SNC. We did not talk about blackface. We did not talk about the ethics and the scandals that took place over the last four years. Why? Because that is not important. What is important are the residents who are losing their jobs, whether in forestry or agriculture. It now seems that even our LNG opportunities are in jeopardy.</ParaText>

When it comes to western jobs, he is absent.</ParaText>

The very next day, Canfor Forest Products, our largest forest products company in Canada, announced curtailment at all its mills throughout British Columbia.

Most importantly, we have kept our party united and strong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022504">That is why I felt it was appropriate to speak to my friends and colleagues today in the House of Commons about one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made. I have just informed my colleagues in the Conservative caucus that I will be resigning as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022506">Serving as the leader of the party that I love so much has been the opportunity and challenge of a lifetime. This was not a decision I came to lightly.

              <ParaText id="6022508">Our Conservative team is always stronger when we are united. When fiscal conservatives, red Tories, social conservatives, libertarians, Quebec nationalists and Conservatives in rural and urban Canada in the east and west come together, great things happen. We elect strong Conservative governments that deliver lower taxes, smaller governments, more freedom and stronger human rights. The party we have all built together is far more important than one individual. </ParaText>

I have always found when we put partisan differences aside, there is a great deal of mutual respect for people of all different parties because when we come to this place, we might disagree on what it is that we think should be done for Canada, but we all agree on the motivation, and that is to make Canada a better place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022559">I would also like to acknowledge the leader of the Progressive Conservatives. I would like to thank him for his service and wish him well in the next chapter of his life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022560">It is not easy to be a politician in this day and age when there is a hard split of opinions on the left and on the right. It would seem to the public that people here with differing opinions are constantly at each other's throats. However, today we are seeing what we can do when we come together to acknowledge the humanity in each other and see that we are not just spokespersons spouting out political ideology but in fact living, breathing human beings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022561">It is this spirit of reconciliation that I believe the throne speech embodies, and since the word “reconciliation” is used many times in it, as a new member of Parliament, I have to say that this is the spirit that I embrace and that I intend to continue to put forward in the days, months and hopefully years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022562">I am a proud Nova Scotian. My riding of Cumberland—Colchester is a beautiful region in northern Nova Scotia. It is bound by the sea on both sides, by the Bay of Fundy and the Northumberland Strait. One of the issues we have is climate change, which is very real for us. Many of us are on flood plains, including my home of Truro, Nova Scotia. We have already had one big flood, which occurred 10 or 11 years ago when I had just become a member of the legislative assembly of Nova Scotia. One of the first tests of my leadership was a huge flood. At the time, it showed me what could be to come if we are not careful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022563">The Chignecto Isthmus is a piece of land at the top of my riding, and it joins Nova Scotia to the mainland of Canada. Right now, the seas have risen so far that the only thing that is keeping the sea from crossing over that isthmus and turning us into an island is a railway. There are 400-year-old Acadian dikes there, an incredible engineering feat that has managed to keep out the seas for this long in Nova Scotia, but the dikes are aging, and we are going to have to raise them. We will also have to take other measures to protect Nova Scotia from the rising seas. This is why I am very pleased to see so many mentions of the environment in the throne speech, as well as the idea that climate change is a crisis and that we need to act now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022564">Therefore, when I hear opposition members say that climate change is not necessarily a priority, it gives me great concern, because in my riding it is a huge concern. The first nations people, the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia, have been very active in combatting all kinds of environmental degradation in our province. I am very proud to have stood with them on the front lines, fighting for government recognition and fighting to get these issues noticed, especially when big corporations are polluting the lands right beside the first nations communities. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022565">In fact, one of the bills I introduced in the legislature in Nova Scotia was called “An Act to Address Environmental Racism”. It acknowledged the disproportionate amount of toxic waste sites, landfills, dumps and huge corporate pollution on the lands of first nations and black communities. I would like environmental racism to be talked about more often, especially in the House, as we move forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022566">It is with great honour that I was elected to the House. It is my first time in Ottawa. I would like to acknowledge the people back home in Cumberland—Colchester who helped me get here. I will not let them down. I will fight for everything I believe in: human rights and justice for women and girls and dealing with human trafficking and domestic violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022567">On domestic violence and gun control, I noted that at least 118 women and girls have been murdered across our country so far this year, according to the annual report from the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability. More often than not, that is a result of domestic violence, and shooting was the most common method of killing. This report comes on the 30th anniversary of the École Polytechnique massacre at the university in Montreal. That shooting, which left 14 innocent young women dead, thrust the term “misogyny” into the public discourse in Canada. It still continues today, and it is a problem. Missing and murdered indigenous women are still a huge issue that we need to address on all sides of this House and in all provinces across this nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022568">I would like to reiterate, in the spirit of reconciliation, that no matter which province we come from in Canada, we are still all Canadians and we still bleed red blood. We want our children and grandchildren to be looked after, have food on the table, have good education and schools, go to school in peace and not be afraid of violence. We want them to have affordable housing, which is also an issue in my area. We need to deal with poverty, including in the middle class, to help people struggling to become part of the middle class. We need to not forget them. As somebody who cares deeply about social, environmental and economic justice, as well as justice for arts and culture and for realizing how important they are to the fabric of our society, I intend to stand in the House as much as I can to remind us all of the importance of these values and doing everything we can to help every single person in Canada, not just a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022569">In Cumberland—Colchester, there are a lot of farms and small businesses, and a lot of women have taken on small businesses. I have to say that it gives me great pride to walk down the streets of Truro, pop into a store and see a female entrepreneur who has been there for 35 years, as in the case of one of my friends. She has a dress store called “Moments”. She dressed me today and other days, and she was very excited about that. There are also many little restaurants. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022570">I am thrilled and excited to help put Cumberland—Colchester on the map and bring more tourists to my beautiful region. There is great wine in Jost, which has many types of incredible wines, including a new red wine called “Great Big Friggin' Red”. For anybody who likes barbecues, spaghetti or steak, it goes with them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022574"> In my community, many people can get in trouble with the law because they have an affliction like alcoholism or addiction. I am an alcoholic, a proud sober alcoholic who has been sober for 24 years. It is not a disease I would wish on anybody. Because I have lived experience and hit bottom at the age of 36, I know how hard it is to live with, for the families and loved ones as well. They say it is a family disease because it affects everybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022575">Therefore, I believe that we need to put more money into addictions research and helping people on the ground. In Nova Scotia, the wait time for people to see an addictions counsellor is atrocious. Sometimes it is 365 days or 125 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022576">I was glad to see that our government put money into mental health in Nova Scotia to the tune of about $138 million each year for the next five years. I am pleased about that because we need as much help as we can get.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022611">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for her kind comments and congratulate her on her re-election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022612">This is more of a comment than a question. She pointed, quite rightly, to the fact that a small number of us in the House, most of whom re-offered for re-election or are back, were involved in the electoral reform committee, where we functioned in a situation where the government did not have a majority. That is now how all committees are going to function. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022613">There is another parallel there as well. The government really needed the support of one party, and any of the parties would work, in order to get a functioning majority. That will prevail in every committee in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022614">Therefore, I want to say, not as much for the benefit of the hon. member as for her party's House leader and whip, that it would make sense to draw upon that expertise and spread it around. That might be true for the other House leaders as well. However, that is the way we are going to function.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022615">I have served now in three majority and four minority parliaments, if we include this one. There is a bit of a different dynamic. We would all benefit from reviewing what worked well in the last minority Parliament, before we start getting into cat fights in committee, rather than after. That is just a thought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022616">I thank the member for what I thought was an excellent and heartfelt speech. I hope there are more heartfelt speeches from this member in the future.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="252898" Type="2">Ms. Lindsay Mathyssen (London—Fanshawe, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6022630">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="252837" Type="2">Hamilton Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022631"> I wanted to once again thank the constituents of London—Fanshawe for electing me to the House. I have worked here for more than a decade, actually in a different capacity, as a parliamentary staffer for many amazing NDP members of Parliament: Chris Charlton from Hamilton—Mountain, Wayne Marston from Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, Jean Crowder from Nanaimo—Cowichan and most recently, the former MP for Essex, Tracey Ramsey. I was also raised by another incredible and powerful woman, who represented London—Fanshawe for the past 13 years: my mother, Irene Mathyssen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022632">I come to this House with many mentors and supporters, and I stand here because of them. It is when I consider important votes, like on this throne speech, that I will always think of the people who elected me here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022633">I hear every day from people in my riding who need help now. If this is all that the Liberals are willing to offer to help Canadians, it is not good enough. I represent a riding where many people are struggling. The average household income in my constituency is well below the national and Ontario averages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022634">I see it every day. People are working harder than ever to keep a roof over their head and to put food on the table. I also see a community that is consistently coming together to support one another, to answer calls for help and to push for more. They deserve better than this throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022635">For more than a decade when someone needed help in London—Fanshawe they knew that they could turn to their member of Parliament. Irene's office was a place that would consistently go above and beyond to advocate and push for anyone who walked through the doors. I will proudly continue that tradition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022636">While my constituency office will work hard to help, I know that more and more people are seeking that help. The policies of past Liberal and Conservative governments are failing them. In the House, in this 43rd Parliament, we have an opportunity to change the direction of the country, one that should put less focus and attention on how well the rich and powerful of this country are doing and more on how everyday Canadians are doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022637">One disturbing trend we have seen is that people are continuing to come to the office in search of affordable housing. Housing prices continue to skyrocket in London as many people are being pushed out by other markets around the GTA. What once was a starter home found throughout London—Fanshawe has become out of reach for too many families. Instead of more empty words, the Liberals could have worked with us to invest in affordable housing so that everybody in Canada could have a place to call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022638"> Canada is in the midst of a national housing crisis impacting every area of the country. Average rents rose in every single province last year, and today 1.7 million Canadian households spend more than 30% of their income on housing. A major part of the long-term solution to the problem is to ensure that more affordable rental units are built across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022639">One in three Canadians is a renter. In many cities, the few affordable apartments available get snapped up quickly, and people end up either living in inadequate housing or forced to spend a huge chunk of their income on rent. If the Liberals are willing to work with us to address the housing crisis in our country, we are ready to deliver for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022640"> Another trend I have heard too many stories about is how people cannot afford their medications. One gentleman came into my office during the campaign who had suffered from a workplace accident. He told my team and me how he had been injured at work. He was going to physiotherapy and attempting to heal and get better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022641">Although he is not well enough to return to work, he knows his benefits are running out. He needs his medication. He cannot live without it, but he also knows he cannot afford it on his own. He told us that he is being forced back to work, even though he is not ready, knowing he is putting his own life in danger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022642">Imagine if we had a system that rather than worrying about how this person is going to survive, to pay for the medicine that he needs to live, he could focus on getting better and returning to work when he is able.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022643">In the days before medicare, New Democrats saw their neighbours suffer because they could not afford the health care they needed. We saw people lose their homes, their farms and their businesses as they struggled to pay their medical bills. We saw illness destroy entire families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022644">In response to that reality, New Democrats led the fight to establish universal public health care for all Canadians. Medicare changed the lives of millions of people and it is one of our party's proudest achievements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022645"> Millions of families cannot afford to take the medications they need because they have no employer-provided drug coverage. The number of uninsured people forced to skip their medications is growing as more people work on contract, are self-employed or have jobs that just do not come with health benefits. Too many seniors are putting their health at risk because they do not have drug coverage and cannot afford out-of-pocket payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022646"> The stress and worry that people feel is not an accident. It is the direct result of deliberate choices that have been made by Liberal and Conservative governments. They choose to let drug companies gouge patients and they choose to leave millions of people uninsured or under-insured, paying hundreds or thousands of dollars out of pocket for the medicine that they need.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022647">Today, Canada is the only wealthy country in the world with a universal health care system that lacks universal prescription-insurance coverage. We pay the third-highest prices for prescription drugs in the world and must deal with a patchwork of programs and coverage, if we are lucky enough to have coverage at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022648">When I look at this throne speech, I see there is no language about any pharmacare being universal, comprehensive or public. There is no funding amount and no timeline. Since the Liberals have been promising pharmacare since 1997, we can see why New Democrats are a bit skeptical. We need to see a real commitment to deliver universal, public, single-payer pharmacare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022649">We are ready to work with the Liberals and deliver for Canadians, but it takes concrete measures to help improve lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022650">There is a growing urgency to also address the climate crisis. I was proud to join hundreds of people from across London at the climate strike in September. I joined them because we need action now and we need bold targets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022651">The real plan to address climate change is needed now. That is why this throne speech is so disappointing. There is nothing on stronger emissions targets for 2030 and nothing to confront the urgency of the problem. In the last four years, the Liberals gave billions of dollars in subsidies to fossil-fuel companies instead of investing in renewable energy and job creation. After being lobbied more than 1,500 times by the fossil-fuel industry, the Liberals are putting big oil first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022652">We also need action to protect our fresh water. With growing algae blooms and invasive species decreasing lake levels, as well as flood damage, we are in need of a national freshwater strategy. A strategy that would set national drinking-water standards would solve the problems presented by piecemeal provincial strategies and years-long boil-water advisories on first nations reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022653">I have been meeting with members from Oneida Nation of the Thames, just outside of London. There, the drinking water has failed to meet provincial standards dating back to 2006. Upstream, London dumps millions of litres of raw sewage into the Thames River that serves as the community's water source. This is unacceptable. Our municipal government recognizes the problem. It wants to help, but there is no action from the government to help address the water situation at Oneida.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022654">After claiming its most important relationship is with indigenous people, the Liberal government continues to break its promise. It refuses to commit to dropping the appeal against fairness for indigenous kids, while also refusing to fix the problem with the child welfare system. It is simply unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022655">The throne speech offers nothing for our seniors, either. Everyone deserves to be able to age with dignity as a valued member of the community. The Liberal government refused to protect workers' pensions, while dragging its feet on the creation of a real plan to deal with the health challenges faced by seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022656">As more Canadians enter their senior years, we need to make better choices and we need to be ready to meet their needs to ensure everyone can age with dignity. With the right leadership, we can make sure our institutions and public services are strong and prepared, and that all seniors have access to the health and social supports they need to make life easier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022657">One group my mother, in her capacity as a member of Parliament, was so proud of and honoured to work with was our veterans. It is time for the government to do right by our veterans. They should not have to wait weeks or even months to receive the services they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022658">Unfortunately, for too long veterans have had to fight for the benefits they have earned. Veterans need investments into their services and increased access to caseworkers. There is also much more that we can do to ease the transition from their life in active service to becoming a veteran.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022659">While I have so much more that I could talk about, I want to finish with this. As it stands, there is not enough in the throne speech for Canadians. People need help now. We urge the Liberals to offer more than just pretty words and to put forward concrete solutions that start to deal with the systemic poverty and inequality that too many face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022660">The Liberals have been putting the demands of the wealthiest and the rich corporations ahead of the needs of Canadians for too long. We are ready to work with them and deliver for Canadians, but it takes courage to make the necessary choices that will truly help improve their lives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022681">In my own riding, it was actually community groups that led the charge, and they had to do all the work. The federal government came in with a small amount afterwards, when all of that work had already been done by the municipality and some of the provincial government advocates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022682">I think there is an expanded role. It is a shame that the government cancelled the national housing strategy in 1993. It was something that New Democrats certainly had been fighting to get back. However, if we could get back to a place where the federal government is actually building those affordable units, the 500,000 units that New Democrats have called for, I would be happy to work with it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022705">Madam Speaker, I would like to welcome the member. It is always good to see former city councillors on the floor of the House speaking to the issues that matter to municipalities. Housing was one of the issues that was referenced in the subamendment that was just tabled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022706">I have read the paragraph in the NDP platform on housing. As a former councillor, I was curious that it required a one-third, one-third matching funding, and that 500,000 homes were going to be built with no mention of how they would be financed. At an average cost of $360,000, that is a $180-billion program. If one-third has to come from municipalities, which is the NDP platform, where are the cities that have that $60 billion financial capacity and how those cities would come up with $60 billion? To put it in context, one-third of federal programs come to Ontario, so that means $60 billion alone for Ontario. For Toronto, that is a $30-billion program he is proposing. That would require the City of Toronto to come up with $10 billion, an extra $1 billion a year on top of the tax base in order to fulfill the NDP's pledge as mandated by its platform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022707">Does the member opposite think the City of Toronto has an extra billion dollars lying about? If it does, why is it not building housing now with it?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022708">Madam Speaker, the former city councillor will know that under this current national housing strategy, the money does not really flow until 2024. Therefore, if Toronto had the capacity to build now, it would be building now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022709">However, the member is quite right. In our platform, it actually does not specify one-third, one-third, one-third. That is under the national housing strategy right now, which quite frankly is only giving a paltry $2.5 billion to social housing, because municipalities cannot afford to continue to download onto the tax levy what is a national responsibility. To have the member rise on the national platform that is in fact spending 19% less than the Conservatives at their peak is a very interesting proposition to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022710">We are looking to take action now. This can no longer be a dream deferred for the millions of people across the country who are in serious core housing need. In Hamilton, we can have record numbers of building permits and cranes dotting the sky while simultaneously having record numbers of people living in the streets. We have heard the government talk about lifting people out of poverty. My question is, where? Who are those people? They certainly do not live in Hamilton Centre.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022712">One of the issues the member highlighted in his speech was the climate emergency. The government often says, and we saw it in the throne speech, that it is going to deal with this issue, yet this is the government that bought a pipeline and has not tackled the subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. We know, according to the IMF, that Canada is subsidizing the fossil fuel industry to the tune of $60 billion a year. We know the government is not tackling the tax loopholes for the wealthiest and the biggest corporations. If it did that, we could save some $10 billion per year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022717">I want to start by thanking the constituents of Beaches—East York, everyone who supported me in the campaign and at the outset of my political career when nobody knew who I was. It is a humbling experience, being a candidate in politics, where hundreds of people come together, all acting on behalf of me and my party and helping us, as individuals, come to this place. I sincerely thank the hundreds of people who have contributed not only in this past election, but also over the years. Of course, I also thank my family and especially my wife Amy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022718">I am not sure whether it is because of the last four years in this place, or in spite of the last four years in this place but I continue to think that this role of being a parliamentarian, being in government, being in politics remains a pathway to making one of the most positive differences we can make in the lives of our neighbours and our fellow citizens. It remains, I think, a noble profession, and we have an opportunity to display that to our fellow Canadians over the next two, three or maybe four years as we seize the opportunity of this minority Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022719">Minority parliaments hold the potential for greatness. Peter Russell is an academic and long-time political scientist who studied minority and majority parliaments around the world, including here at home. He has called minority parliaments here in Canada some of the most dynamic in our history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022720">Of course, the throne speech makes reference to Pearson. When we look to the Pearson years, we see co-operation that was able to deliver the Canada pension plan, Canada student loans, public health care and the flag. During those five years in Canadian history, Parliament accomplished more than most Parliaments we have seen before, so this minority situation holds potential for greatness. It is up to us, and how we conduct ourselves in this place, whether we seize the opportunity or whether we succumb to partisan politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022721">One of the jobs in this place, as we hopefully seize the opportunity, is to work across the aisle. In the last Parliament, I had the good fortune to work across the aisle with Murray Rankin of the NDP on cannabis amnesty and with Fin Donnelly of the NDP on the shark fin trade. I had the opportunity to work across the aisle with current members in this House from the Conservatives and the NDP to tackle election interference, platform governance and privacy protections. I think if people watched our committee in the last Parliament, they would be hard pressed to determine who was the Liberal, who was the member from the NDP and who was the Conservative. That is how this place should operate, particularly at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022722">I hope we see more of those opportunities in this place going forward. I also worked really hard in the last Parliament to carve out some space, which is not always the easiest thing to do in this business, for principled independence. If I heard anything from my constituents in this last election, it is that they want me and the people in this place to work together as much as possible to accomplish big ideas for our country. They also want us to be less partisan and to carve out more of that principled independence and to carry that with us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022723">I want to echo the throne speech and the message that Canadians sent us here with a clear message, which is to work together, and I hope we all take that very seriously going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022724">Canadians were also clear about the need to tackle climate change in a much more serious way. I had the good fortune in early June to introduce a bill to require the government to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. I was incredibly happy to see that as a core commitment in our platform, and as a core and early commitment in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022725">Our principal goal in this Parliament is to set Canada on a credible path to net zero while we ensure a just transition for affected workers and affected regions. That is our principal challenge in the coming years. We have come a long way over the last four years. In early 2016, Environment Canada told us that projected 2030 emissions were 815 megatonnes. After four years of policy-making that included methane rules to reduce methane emissions by 40%; phasing out coal-fired electricity; the price on pollution; massive investments in public transit, clean tech and energy efficiency; and the clean fuel standard, which, as an aside, all of us in this place need to keep an eye on because it is in the process of being watered down, that 815 megatonnes is now 592, a 25% reduction.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022726">For the first time in my lifetime, we had a federal government that took climate change seriously and acted. It did not just set targets and blow past them, and that was the fault of the Conservatives and the Liberals I agree, but for the first time set targets and took action to meaningfully reduce emissions. Now our task is to build on that progress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022727">In our platform, we promised a number of important initiatives such as expanding electric vehicle charging infrastructure and planting two billion trees. We promised to incentivize clean-tech businesses in a serious way. There will be continued investments in public transit and more, so none of those measures add up to where we need to be. Therefore, we will require more serious action to meet our international, our intergenerational and fundamentally our moral obligations in tackling climate change and doing our part. Doing our part: What does that mean?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022728"> We have a 2030 target right now that is 512 megatonnes, and that will be a challenge. However, if we take science seriously, the IPCC tells us that the world has to reduce emissions to 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. How many in this place have that number in their head? What does that number mean? It is 380 megatonnes. Our current target is 512 megatonnes. The minimum we ought to be doing our best to reach is 380 megatonnes, 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, and that is not an easy task, but if we are not sufficiently ambitious in our goals, we will not be forceful enough in our actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022729">On the matter of co-operation and climate change, I fundamentally believe in the platform we put forward, strong action, but I also saw a promise from the NDP on an independent climate accountability office, and that is really important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022730">A Conservative creation, the Parliamentary Budget Officer, holds the government to account on our behalf as parliamentarians. It helps us hold the government to account when finance tables a budget. When we turn those long-term goals into a five-year carbon budget to ensure we have short-term practical climate action, so too do we need an independent mechanism to hold the government to account on its carbon budget process. Whether that is housed in a PBO or housed in the environmental commissioner or whether we adopt a different and independent framework, that promise of independent climate accountability is an important one. There is an opportunity to work across the aisle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022731">When we look at the promise in our platform on a just transition act, now we can say that the Bloc Québécois came back and that party represents a good portion of Quebec. However, if I am more honest about regional differences, and I see Alberta and Saskatchewan, I know, as a member from Toronto, that the Conservative Party best represents Alberta and Saskatchewan in this place. If I think about co-operation and working across the aisle, as we develop that just transition act, we absolutely must be learning from, listening to and heeding the advice of our Conservative colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022732">The throne speech also talked about strengthening the middle class. Obviously, those of us in this place and those across the country have heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this government mention the middle class once or twice over the years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022733"> Increasing the basic personal amount is an important step. It will affect many Canadians. These are big numbers. Twenty million Canadians will have their taxes reduced. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians will be taken off the tax roll. When we increase the basic personal amount from just over $12,000 to $15,000, it will mean that people who really ought not to be paying any taxes at all will not be paying them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022734">It will cost $6 billion, and there is a challenge here. It is not paid for. It is deficit finance. It is obviously going to be implemented as it is our platform promise. If I am to be somewhat critical and fair, budgets continue to be sustainable and I will believe that as long as the PBO tells me that, but value for money is a different proposition altogether. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022735">We do need to ensure that there is fairness in spending as between generations. I do worry, from a fiscal sustainability standpoint, about a broad-based tax cut or even the increase to OAS when they are deficit financed. They should be properly paid for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022736">There is another area of both optimism, because of the success and progress over the last four years, and also some criticism. With regard to those working hard to join the middle class or low-income Canadians, those struggling with poverty, we have made incredible strides over the last four years with the national housing strategy, and housing benefits come online this year. Hundreds of thousands of people no longer live in poverty, almost 900,000 people, according to Statistics Canada numbers. That is incredible progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022737">However, as chair of the anti-poverty caucus in the last Parliament, having taken over from Senator Eggleton, who continues to do incredible advocacy on a basic income, I would be remiss if I did not note not only the incredible progress, but also a lack of similar ambition in this place going forward.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022738">We brought hundreds of thousands of Canadians out of poverty by increasing the Canada child benefit and the GIS. Going forward, I do not see similar promises from any party that will lift that same significant number of Canadians out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022739">However, there is good news with respect to another area of potential collaboration. I will provide a bit of history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022740"> When Ralph Goodale was the minister of finance, he introduced a measure of basic income support, like the OAS, the GIS and the Canada child benefit, but for the working poor. It was not implemented. It was a good Liberal idea at the time, but it became a good Conservative idea when finance minister Jim Flaherty introduced it in this place and made it a reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022741"> In the namesake of his riding, Whitby, it was WITB, the working income tax benefit. In the last Parliament, we increased that significantly, and while I am not sure how many people were paying attention to the member for <Affiliation DbId="252713" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> and the leadership, he was calling for it to be increased, so we had a Liberal finance minister, a Conservative finance minister and an NDP troublemaker all calling for the same measure to be increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022742"> When we look at the total numbers, we see over $50 billion a year for seniors in OAS and GIS and over $20 billion a year for children through the Canada child benefit. However, even after the increases in the last Parliament, we only see $2 billion a year for basic income support for the working poor, the people who are working multiple jobs, who are struggling to get by and who need it the most. That is where the action should be in this place, on poverty reduction, when it is an idea that we have already agreed on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022743">The throne speech also talks about keeping Canadians safe. There are so many different ways we can talk about keeping Canadians safe. For those members who were not in this place in the last Parliament, a member of my local chapter of Young Liberals, Reese Fallon, was killed in the Danforth shooting. The hardest speech I have ever had to give was at her funeral. It was a great honour for our community and the family that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was so engaged that he was able to come to the funeral, but we need action, and in his platform, we saw action. The question then becomes this: How do we make that action as effective as possible? As a reminder to all of us in this place, defaults matter, so if we are to give cities the power to set their own rules, there ought to be a baseline set of rules that cities can opt out of if we truly want that policy to be effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022744">With respect to keeping Canadians safe, I am happy to say that working across the aisle in the last Parliament on privacy issues, we saw a great deal of that work and those recommendations from our committee become promises in our platform. We are going to keep Canadians safe online. As my three-year-old grows up, he will live his entire life online, and we need rules to reflect his reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022745">Thousands of Canadians continue to die because of a contaminated drug supply and our opioid crisis. To reference Statistics Canada numbers, for the first time in the last 40 years, life expectancy has stalled, attributed to the opioid crisis. Thousands of people have died. If it were not from substance use, I guarantee there would be more committed governmental responses from the provinces. As a federal government, we took significant action over the last four years, but we do not see that collective action across parties and provinces to address this real public health crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022746"> The throne speech rightly says that we have done much, but there is more to do. I hope we all agree in this place with this simple premise: that we should treat drug use as a health issue. Yes, we must tackle traffickers and producers, but the very people who need our help, the patients, should be treated as patients and not criminals. If we do that for alcohol and gambling, we ought to do it for all substances. That is how we save lives. If we start with the premise that we treat drug use as a public health issue, and we all agree on that, then let us work together on what that means in legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022747">My constituents have also called for a faster strategy to tackle rare diseases, and they continue to call for a universal and national approach to pharmacare. I know that was referenced in the throne speech and in our platform, and there was a lot of good work done in the last Parliament. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022748">I have a 13-year-old constituent, Helena Kirk, who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of three and went through 841 days of chemotherapy. She met with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">science minister</Affiliation> and the former <Affiliation DbId="233811" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation>. In our platform was a $30-million commitment to pediatric cancer research, largely because of Helena's advocacy. I want to thank Helena for her hard work and let her know that we will do as much as we can to save the lives of her friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022749">It is not only about keeping Canadians safe; it is also about all living beings in Canadian society who think, feel and love. That includes animals in our society, and our pets and more. We made progress in the last Parliament on animal protections and we have to continue to build on that progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022750">Importantly, the throne speech talked about moving forward on reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022751"> I will first talk about the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal case. I have heard the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> that say money is no object. At the end of January, we have to deliver submissions to the tribunal that properly set out a path for just compensation, saying money is no object, what it will cost and that we have a fair path forward. Having already spoken to the minister, I will be looking very closely at our submissions. We need to ensure that those in our society who have suffered discrimination by the government receive due compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022752">We have seen incredible progress on clean water, an issue I hear a lot about from the constituents in my community. Over the last four years, over 60% of long-term boil water advisories on reserve were lifted. We injected $2 billion into the system. When the PBO said more money was needed, more money was provided. We remain on track to lift all advisories within the five-year commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022753"> There is another specific project, in Grassy Narrows, that needs to be made a priority. I was very pleased to hear the <Affiliation DbId="233806" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> say that money was no object and that the facility would be built with federal support. Again, I will be looking at that very closely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022754">Then there is the implementation of UNDRIP. I ran into Romeo Saganash very briefly when he was here the other day. We spoke briefly about our promise in our platform that his bill would be a floor. I hope to see the amendments, which were not adopted in the last Parliament, made to his bill. I hope his bill will be a floor. We have a historic opportunity to implement UNDRIP and provide the rights to indigenous peoples that they fundamentally deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022755">On a final note on reconciliation, on our urban indigenous communities, I did not see enough in our platform or in the throne speech. We need a much stronger commitment to urban indigenous communities. In Ontario alone, some of the estimates I have seen are that over 80% of indigenous people do not live on reserve. We need to ensure that indigenous services understands that and is able to deliver services properly to urban indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6022756">On Canada's place in the world, there have been great successes over the last four years. We saw greater fairness in our immigration and refugee system. Just to be clear, we brought in more refugees last year than any other country in the world. We are doing our part, which is the right thing to do. My riding has a very strong Bangladeshi community. Those in that community called on me to be vocal on the Rohingya refugee crisis. I and this government were, on the recommendations of Bob Rae. I am very proud of the government's efforts on that issue in the last Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022757">We need to continue to take that leadership on the global stage on human rights. We need to continue to defend and support our multilateral institutions. We are best at fundamentally supporting institutions. Whether it is training judges, election commissioners, parliamentary processes, we need to double down on what we are best at. We are doing it in some countries, but clearly, when we see what is going on around the world, other countries could use some of that stable support and democratic decision-making from the Canadian Parliament and the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022758">On global climate action, we saw great leadership in the last Parliament on phasing out coal, not only domestically but also abroad. We were global leaders in helping the rest of the world chart this path. We need to continue to do that work, but we cannot do that if we do not do the strong work at home to meet our emission reduction targets. We have to help lead our country and the world on this defining issue of our time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022759">I will close by reiterating that we have in this minority Parliament a real opportunity to work together on these big ideas and issues that can make such a difference in the lives of Canadians and citizens of the world. Let us seize that opportunity and not waste it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022761">Some of the points the member raised on the growing need to have some sort of regulation of social media giants is a critical challenge that we will face in this Parliament. I think, in many ways, if we do not do that, we are going to see a continuation of the preference bubble approach to politics, because the secret algorithms and everything else almost encourage people to only listen to voices within their own tribe. The rhetoric that we see that is often influenced by foreign actors as well is limiting discourse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022762">I really like the fact that in the last Parliament a committee led by a Conservative member, my friend from Prince George, with this member and others, combined with other parliamentarians from other countries started tackling these issues. While there was not much in the throne speech on this, I wonder if the member can speak to that work. Is there an ability for some cross-partisan support to really get a handle on this for our children's future and also for the future of serious political discourse in Canada?</ParaText>

As I mentioned in my remarks, one would be hard pressed to know which party we each represented. We were there on behalf of Canada working with our international partners from different parties as well. Similarly, when looking at the U.K. Parliament, one would be hard pressed to know who the Tory or Labour members were. That fundamentally is the approach that bears results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022765">Tackling tech and talking about GDPR-like rules became a growing consensus at our committee, cross-partisan.

              <ParaText id="6022766">In fact, in the public sector if a department or agency wants to employ an algorithm that is going to have a potential adverse effect, some 80-odd questions have to be answered. They are in the four risk categories. Depending on the risk category, they take certain remedial efforts.

An election is always forever on the horizon in a minority Parliament. That is the fundamental challenge, how to set aside partisanship while knowing that an election is on the horizon.

              <ParaText id="6022780">Madam Speaker, of course I agree that we ought to subsidize the things that we want, which are cleaner technologies, and not subsidize the things we do not want, which are technologies that hurt the environment. However, I want to be clear that when the oil and gas sector or other industries can move the needle on reducing emissions, there are opportunities potentially to offer incentives for them to reduce emissions if they otherwise would not. Really what we should be looking at is the dollar cost for emissions reductions and where the efficiencies might be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022781">On the Trans Mountain pipeline specifically, I always understood that the bulk of the profits, to the extent we see them, occurs when the project is completed, because that is when the capacity is able to increase and we will see more revenue generated in our economy and more tax revenue certainly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022782"> Let me just note that the supply-side measures are incredibly hard to accomplish when there are not alternatives in the marketplace. Phasing out coal-fired electricity makes a good deal of sense because there are alternatives and we can see emissions reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022783"> However, in taking a supply-side measure on oil and gas today in Canada, what is going to happen is we are going to see the same global demand. Global supply is more than sufficient to meet that global demand, and we will have frittered away industry in Canada and not made a difference at all to tackle the overall picture of global climate change. Therefore, we have to be very careful about supply-side measures and blocking projects in Canada without considering the impacts around the world. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6022847">The Battle of Ortona took place over the course of eight bitter days during Christmas of 1943. Victory would cost 502 Canadian lives. The best estimates put civilian deaths at 1,300. Sadly, the town had not been evacuated before being overrun by retreating Germans. The fighting in Ortona that Christmas was hand to hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6022848">Ortona is just one example of the extreme sacrifices Canadians made in the hellish conditions of the Italian Campaign. The campaign raged on for one year, 10 months and 22 days. These are sacrifices we must always honour.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023064">I would like to start by thanking the residents of Northumberland—Peterborough South for allowing me the great honour to rise and speak today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023065">I would also like to take a moment to thank the leader of Her Majesty's official opposition for his service to the party, Parliament and the country. I look forward to serving in Parliament with him and continuing his great work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023066">Members are of course aware of the hon. member's accomplishments: He was the youngest Speaker ever in Canada, he increased the size of our caucus dramatically and he won the popular vote. However, I would like to relate a story of what happened during the campaign, as I think it highlights a part of his character that we may not all be aware of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023067">He came out to visit my riding, the beautiful riding of Northumberland—Peterborough South. My son was there and was a bit upset: He was moved away from his dad and did not like it. The Leader of the Opposition went over to my son, cheered him up, grabbed one of his hands and we started to swing him. We swung him once, twice, three times and he would not let us stop. The wild part was that whenever we went to any other political event, and I apologize for the breach in protocol in using a member's name, but my son would ask, “Is Andrew Scheer going to be there?” I am definitely the second-most popular politician in my house.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023068">Once again I thank, from the bottom of my heart, the Leader of the Opposition for his great service to his country and what he did for my family personally. I would not be here without him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023069">On a different note, I want to thank the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for his conciliatory tone in the Speech from the Throne. However, to solve the many issues we are facing today, change will require more than a change in tone. We need substance. We need willingness from the government to partner with a party that received the most votes in the last federal election. Canadians elected us not just to speak but to act. We need to act for those who are struggling the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023070">During the last five months of the campaign, I door-knocked with our team, knocking on over 40,000 doors, and heard over and over again that times are getting tougher and things are getting more expensive. We need to act for those people. We need to make things better for the average Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023071">The average Canadian now spends more on taxes than on food, clothing and shelter combined. This is being felt by our most vulnerable. Young Canadians looking to start their lives are finding it harder and harder to pay their rent or mortgage. The idea of saving for a rainy day, which will happen with the shocks in the economy, is not there any more. Folks out there right now are trying to make it from payment to payment and, quite frankly, these are not always being made. Nearly half of Canadians are within $200 of not making their payments. Sadly, there are many folks who are not making their payments at all, as personal bankruptcies are reaching decade highs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023072">Our millennials and those before asked our generation and the generations before for an opportunity. Instead, all they got was legalized marijuana. The generations that preceded them felt the dignity and honour of working, of building equity in their businesses and homes, but increasingly the youth of our generation are being denied that opportunity. We need to give them back the opportunity to not just get by but get ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023073">We need to act and we need to act soon for the underemployed and unemployed. We have had the worst job losses since 2008. Personal prosperity does not start with a government program; it starts with a great job or a new business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023074">Canadian small businesses provide more than 70% of the jobs in the private sector, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> looks at business owners simply as a way to avoid taxes. I do not think that is right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023075">Businesses in Canada are not optimistic about the future. Over the last five years, we have seen a 20% reduction in investments in equipment and plants. When they look forward, they do not see good things to come. Government needs to get out of the way of business owners to make sure they can do what they do best: create jobs. We need to cut the red tape now, not five years from now, not 10 years from now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023076">At the heart of many of these issues is the productivity gap, which has only been exacerbated over the last four years. Canadians contribute $50 to the GDP per hour of work. In contrast, our neighbours to the south contribute $60, or better yet, Switzerland contributes $65 and Ireland 84. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023077">What is the big deal? How does it affect us? It has a real impact on Canadians, because it is lowering our wages. If we want life to be more affordable, if we want Canadians to be more prosperous, we must increase our productivity, because this has brought down our average wages to $19. In contrast, in the United States it is $23, or better yet, it is almost double that in Switzerland, at $33.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023078">When we increase productivity, we increase the wealth of our nation, wealth that can be used by parents to help feed their children, by students to pay for university, by the unemployed to be employed and by seniors to retire with dignity. Despite the overwhelming evidence that productivity will make life better for all Canadians, the word “productivity” was mentioned in the throne speech exactly zero times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023079">The Speech from the Throne was replete with messages that would suppress productivity instead of increasing it. It did not contain any measures to improve the drivers of productivity, such as innovation, technology, small business and, notably, any support for the resource sector. Canadians involved in the resource sector contribute a remarkable $600 per hour to the GDP. If we want to increase the wealth of our nation, we need to continue to invest in the resource sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023080">When we enhance the productivity of our nation, we necessarily create jobs, increase income and increase the size of the middle class. Of equal importance, we also increase tax revenue, which can be used to increase our funding for important social programs like health care, the environment and, perhaps most importantly, our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023081">People within my riding and the rest of Canada need jobs, higher incomes and more affordable goods and services. Quite frankly, the Speech from the Throne did not provide those things. We have a choice to make: We can continue to watch our productivity slip down the spiral underneath the tremendous weight of failed policies, increased regulation and excessive taxation, or we can decide to take a different path and instead climb the staircase of prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023082">Our nation is depending on us coming to Parliament and to our committees, supporting not just our party's ideas, but the best ideas. This is our reality. If we do not act together, if the government does not compromise with the party that won the most seats in the last election, we will further alienate our regions and drive a deeper wedge into our wonderful country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023083">We will need more than a conciliatory tone. We need an openness to a different direction, a more productive direction, a movement away from that downward productivity spiral and a movement up the staircase of prosperity.</ParaText>

I live in British Columbia, where we have had the perfect storm. We have had a curtailment in the forestry sector. We have had record-low salmon returns. Our commercial fleet did not even get fishing until the end of August. People are desperate. They are losing their homes and their houses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023089">We are calling on the minister and the government to extend EI and provide training, resources and investments in these strategic areas, in the fishing area and in the forestry sector, so that we can maximize our profit. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023098">Mr. Speaker, we had the most comprehensive climate change plan ever introduced in Canada. The reality is that climate change is a global problem and it requires a global solution.

              <ParaText id="6023099">We believe in investment in technology. I have said this to many high schools throughout Northumberland—Peterborough South as I travelled around: The cure for some of our greatest ills may be in this room right now.

I thank all the donors and the hundreds of friends, family members and volunteers who put in countless hours. I thank my husband Larry Gray, my son Daniel Gray, my immediate family and all of my friends. It was a family decision, and it was a huge family effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023103">Kelowna—Lake Country is a wonderful mix of urban and rural, and we are one of the fastest-growing communities in Canada, which creates opportunities and challenges.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023106">I would like to step back for a moment to bring forth the reasons I decided to run to become a member of Parliament, which go back over two years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023107">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to Kelowna to speak at a town hall at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan, and I went there as a Kelowna city councillor to hear the Prime Minister speak. I am sitting, in this House, the approximate distance from the Prime Minister's seat that I was that day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023108">After hearing the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> answer question after question about the tax changes he was proposing at the time, which would negatively affect families and small businesses, as a mother and small business owner myself, I knew first-hand how out of touch the Prime Minister was. It compelled me to run.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023109">Let us not forget that at the time of these proposed small-business tax changes over two years ago, 35 organizations from across the country came together in an unprecedented way to form the Coalition for Small Business Tax Fairness, a unified voice to oppose the federal government's tax proposals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023110">President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Perrin Beatty, said, “I've never seen an issue that has generated greater concern among our members.... To make matters worse, allotting only 75 days for comment in the midst of the summer holidays is not a consultation. It's a stealth attack on farmers and family businesses.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023111">Not all the originally proposed tax changes were implemented. However, many were, including changes to passive investments and income splitting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023112">I have spoken with thousands of constituents in my riding across Kelowna—Lake Country who have been negatively affected by the small-business tax changes. There are farmers who cannot retire, families who are paying considerably more in personal income tax and spouses who had to go back to work and stop volunteering at their children's school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023113">One family's story really resonated with me. They had to make the tough decision last year to not buy RESPs for the children. These are real people, with real-life situations. I rose in this House a couple of days ago to ask the government to repeal these tax changes and, in typical fashion, the response from the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> was out of touch with how these failed policies truly affect people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023114">In addition to being engaged in the community every day, I door-knocked for an entire year. Come snow, sleet or summer heat, I personally knocked on over 30,000 doors and with my incredible team of volunteers, we knocked on over 55,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023115">We talked to people on their doorsteps, and I realized that the concerns I had with the government were not mine alone. I heard many issues consistently across my riding. People were not just concerned, but they felt as though their voices were not being heard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023116">Their concerns included the rising cost of living, overall affordability, mental health and addiction on our streets, the desire to work hard and get ahead, constituents in the resource sector losing their jobs, business tax changes, government red tape, infringement on personal freedoms and rights, clean air and water and cumbersome temporary farm worker procedures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023117">Kelowna is experiencing an addictions crisis that affects our entire community. Mental health and addiction is a topic I have personally spent a lot of time focusing on by meeting with individual residents, community groups, government officials, treatment homes, first responders and health professionals. It is clear that there is little focus on building a system of care that includes treatment and recovery. Constituents and neighbourhoods are feeling like their concerns are not being heard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023118">We need to hold criminals accountable for the flow of illicit fentanyl. We need laws that target criminals and keep them off our streets, and we need to better equip our police. We need to focus on helping Canadians struggling with addiction through recovery and prevention. This is a gap. There is nothing in the throne speech addressing this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023119">We need to amend the Canadian drugs and substances strategy and fully implement actionable items that address getting people out of addiction, including direct funding for addictions treatment and recovery centres. I implore the government to make this a federal priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023120">Tolko Industries in Kelowna announced the permanent closure of its mill, meaning that 127 people who were laid off recently will now add to the mill's total of 217 permanent jobs lost. This brings the total jobs lost in the forestry sector in British Columbia alone to 4,000. These are well-paying jobs that support families in our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023121">I have spoken to many people in the forestry industry and their message is similar: There is not a lack of renewable resources available and the costs and regulations associated with provincial and federal governments are making it more difficult to operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023122">There is no mention of the softwood lumber agreement in the throne speech. Canada has filed trade complaints against the United States in the past and has won. However, when our local companies pay tariffs up front, it adds substantially to their immediate costs. The federal government needs to negotiate a softwood lumber agreement to end this dispute, give certainty to the industry and get people back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023123">My community of Kelowna—Lake Country is strongly tied to the prairie provinces economically. I meet people every day who live and work between B.C. and Alberta in the oil and gas sector. We used to have direct flights from Kelowna to Fort McMurray. Those have been cancelled due to the economic downturn. The throne speech says nothing about what the government is going to do about getting people back to work. We need to ensure that we have stable regulations within the energy sector in order to attract and keep investment in Canada. We need to get people back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023124">It does not matter whether they are students, families or retirees, I hear from people every day about the affordability of everything. I saw with all my door-knocking where multiple generations are living together, as many people are trying to figure out how they are going to get ahead. We need to keep taxes low while at the same time not get further into debt as a country. People are concerned about paying higher taxes in the future to pay off debt for decisions being made today by the Liberals. There is nothing in the throne speech that talks about when we are going to get back to a balanced budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023125">Something that is important to my constituents in Kelowna—Lake Country is to protect our watershed from invasive zebra and quagga mussels. There is nothing in the throne speech about protecting water sources. When these invasive mussels get into a lake, they change the ecology, basically taking over, making beaches unwalkable in bare feet and attaching onto infrastructure in water. Many people get drinking water from our lakes. A study showed it would cost $40 million per year in the Okanagan alone in economic losses and direct costs to manage if these get into our lakes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023126">I had the honour of chairing the Okanagan Basin Water Board, which is the organization spearheading this in British Columbia. We met with the fisheries and oceans minister here in Ottawa to elevate the issue when the invasive mussels presented themselves just south of the border in the United States and moved west to Manitoba. The allocation of resources from the government was nominal and it did nothing to protect the Okanagan basin or western Canada from these invasive mussels progressing west.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023127">Last, I am honoured to have been asked to serve as the shadow cabinet minister for interprovincial trade. This will bring the voices of Kelowna—Lake Country and British Columbia forward at an elevated level to hold the government to account. The free movement of goods, services and people across provincial borders is imperative. Red tape stifles business. We have free trade agreements with other countries but not within our own country. As an entrepreneur working in the British Columbia wine industry for 27 years, I saw first-hand how interprovincial trade barriers made it challenging to expand markets within our local British Columbia wineries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023128"> It is no secret that our country is currently divided. Internal trade disputes have escalated between provinces, creating uncertainty. The government must take national unity seriously, reduce regulations and free up the movement of goods and services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023129">My commitment is to continue to be active and engaged in my community while being a strong voice in this House for the constituents of Kelowna—Lake Country.</ParaText>

Different jurisdictions have different levels of authority. For example, I know that in the Okanagan with the Okanagan Lake system it is the Province of B.C. that manages the water flows throughout the lake system, which can affect usage by residents and also affect fish. </ParaText>

At the federal level there are different funding opportunities in order to protect our lake and water systems.

Of course, we have some large and medium-size businesses as well, but certainly, we have a lot of small business owners. Basically, what I hear is that people are willing to take risks, they put their house on the line, and it should be okay for them to want to get ahead. I have heard business owners, who are quite frustrated, ask why they should continue to stay in business, because they are working seven days a week, 12 hours a day. Some of the tax changes that I spoke about repealing would definitely be helpful to them. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023151">I want to express my overwhelming gratitude to the people of Whitby. I am so happy to be here. It is such an honour to be sitting in the House and to have the opportunity to serve at the highest level of our democracy. I am elated by the fact that the people of Whitby chose me and the Liberal Party to represent them in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023152">I also want to thank each and every member of the House on their election. I also thank the hon. <Affiliation DbId="232946" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> for his years of service. I would like to acknowledge the many exceptional people who made profound contributions to my campaign. No matter how small or large their involvement was, I am forever indebted to them and touched by their generosity and all they gave. They inspired me every day, and continue to do so. There are too many people to name, but I want them all to know that they paved the way for me to be here. I thank them for putting their confidence in me. I will never take for granted the great privilege it is to serve in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023153">I would like to also thank four generations of women in my life who have been the bedrock of my family: my grandmother, mother, sister, my wife, and my eight-year-old little girl. These strong, resilient women have supported me in so many ways and really provided a foundation of love and support for me throughout my life. I thank them from the bottom of my heart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023154">I also want to acknowledge my father for his 30 or more years of service in the public service. He was a police officer for the Peel region and served on the National Parole Board. I thank my dad for always being a great role model to me and showing me what a life of service is really about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023155">I want to state something plainly and clearly with all the force and conviction that I feel for it: The Liberal Party of Canada is truly the reason I ran in this election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023156">Before entering federal politics, I was an entrepreneur, a sort of special type of entrepreneur: a social entrepreneur. I built a mission-based consulting company, specializing in social innovation. That is right, social innovation. What does that mean? Social innovation is applying new approaches to society's toughest and most persistent challenges. I spent over a decade working with teams of people, mostly in the non-profit and charitable sector, but in many cases across all sectors, to facilitate inclusive, consultative processes using design-thinking and collective-impact approaches that generated innovative solutions to achieve systemic change. I have worked on ocean protection, energy efficiency, food security, affordable housing, children's health and nutrition, environmental monitoring, waste reduction, workforce development, child care settlement, seniors care, education, mental health, diversity and inclusion and many more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023157">In over 350 projects, I studied the persistent social challenges and took the many perspectives of stakeholders into account to generate innovative solutions with many stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023158">Based on these experiences, I see that the Liberal Party in the last term really stepped up to the plate. It consulted the key stakeholders on these important issues and matters to Canadians, and gathered research and engaged partners and actors from across Canada in formulating solutions and strategies for change. It made evidence-based decisions and then committed significant and appropriate resources to make strategic investments in addressing the many issues that matter to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023159">This is the very definition of good governance. Since joining the party, I have been absolutely awestruck at how open, authentic, supportive and hard-working the people in this government really are, including our cabinet and leader. Responsive, accountable, visionary, strategic and hard-working: I think these are what Canadians want in their government and why we have been chosen to deliver on this for another term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023160">During this election, the people of Whitby shared many stories, experiences and concerns with me at their front door. They talked about the many challenges they were facing in their daily lives and their concerns about their families and preserving their quality of life. They identified pressing issues that are important to them and that should be top of mind for this government moving forward. These included supporting our seniors, addressing climate change, building a stronger local economy, making home ownership more attainable for many and developing a central infrastructure to reduce commute times. They talked about the pressures they experienced from the rising cost of living.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023161">I heard about the challenges experienced by parents who had children with developmental disabilities. I heard about the need for community safety and the need for youth mental health supports and programming and many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023162">The most prevalent issues for Whitby that I will discuss today are seniors, climate change and local economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023163">In supporting our seniors, I will say that it was a pleasure to meet many of our seniors across Whitby over the course of the fall. I visited many seniors homes and talked to hundreds of seniors. As we know, a higher proportion of the population is reaching the age of retirement, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have engaged with seniors and heard their feelings and concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023164">Many talked about income security, the rising cost of living and the limited availability of affordable housing options that are really geared to their needs, and the challenges they have experienced in accessing health care. People told me about the cost of medication and dental care, which is putting additional strain on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023165">Our government over its last term began addressing all of these issues in our communities, including making the largest contribution in history to the Canada pension plan, increasing old age security and the guaranteed income supplement, and returning the age of retirement to 65 after the previous Conservative government raised it to 67. We also laid the foundation for national universal pharmacare, and the national housing strategy certainly focuses on the needs of seniors. I was extremely happy to hear that seniors were explicitly mentioned multiple times in the Speech from the Throne. It is clear that our seniors are top of mind and important to us in addressing their needs moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023166">Again, we are making seniors a priority by increasing old age security for people over age 75 and implementing national pharmacare with dental benefits and increasing the survivor benefit by 25%. There are a significant number of things in the platform that are really going to help support our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023167">The next issue I want to talk about briefly is action on climate change. This is the top issue for my constituents. Many times over they told me of their great concerns about flooding and other environmental disasters. We have taken their needs seriously, and in the throne speech it was good to hear many references to climate action. In fact, our government has done more on climate change than probably any other government in Canadian history, and has always listened to science-based research and data. We have taken international targets seriously and are putting in place instruments and tools to achieve the long-term behavioural change that will address the causes of the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023168">We are making positive steps forward. We declared a national climate emergency. We put a price on pollutants. We protected 14% of Canada's coastal and marine ecosystem. We developed a pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change with the input of stakeholders from across the country. This framework allowed each province and territory to have input and set targets for reduced emissions by building resilience while growing our economy at the same time. This is a really balanced approach, thinking that the environment and the economy can go hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023169">We are doing and committing to a lot more in the platform for this term. I am really proud to see things in there like planting two billion trees, protecting 25% of our land and oceans by 2025 and, eventually, by 2050, getting to zero carbon emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023170">We know that we have to move to electric vehicles, support green infrastructure and increase the energy efficiency in people's homes. We are making it easier for them to do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023171">Lastly, my constituents wanted the government to help build a stronger local economy, and there are many opportunities to do that. The most important thing for me is to acknowledge the track record of success of our Liberal government since the last term. We have created just under one million jobs, reduced poverty significantly, invested in infrastructure, invested an unprecedented amount in R and D and innovation in high-growth industries, supported the skilled trades, invested in small business and have set up regional economic agencies, development agencies and more.

Nevertheless, it spent several billion dollars to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline that will carry oil to the Pacific near Vancouver, potentially threatening certain species, including salmon. Then there is the so-called new NAFTA, which turns its back on Quebec's green aluminum industry.</ParaText>

We need to support those industries as well as mitigate the risk to climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023193">Of course, the answer is no. If a thermometer is telling us that the planet is warming up, then we need to do our job in order to make a switch to clean energy and find cleaner sources of energy with more efficient ways of using it. We need to lower our emissions.</ParaText>

Carbon pricing has won a Nobel Prize in economics because it is a very, very effective solution. I am glad that our government has stepped in to make sure that everybody follows a carbon pricing scheme. Investments in green energy and green infrastructure across the country will continue to bring our goal of being at zero by 2050 all the closer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023196">There are some local resource extraction projects, aggregate mines, and a proposed intermodal infrastructure project, which my neighbours are vociferously opposed to. I will ensure that their perspectives are heard in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023197">Second, the topic of immigration came up a lot. When I was 26 years old, I had the honour of carrying our flag into the opening ceremonies of the Bird’s Nest stadium at the Olympic Games. When I was the flag-bearer for Team Canada at the Olympics and one of my teammates started singing “O Canada”, quickly about 300 of my teammates and sporting heroes joined in. As I turned around and raised the flag, my eyes swept across the parade of athletes from different countries around the world, and I noticed something: Team Italy looked like Italians and Team Norway looked like Norwegians. When I faced Team Canada, much like this House, we looked like the world. That diversity is something that I do not think we can take for granted. It is something for which we have got to be consistent champions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023198">My profile as an athlete and my platform as an athlete allowed me to do a lot of great work with organizations like Right to Play and WaterAid as an athlete ambassador and somebody who could bring light to really important projects around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023199">I was a little bit disheartened to hear in other platforms a commitment to lower the amount of foreign aid that we give to other countries and the work that we do there. I think foreign aid is a really important investment in global security. It is an investment in our own security here in Canada and it is an acknowledgement that we have it really good in Canada. We live in one of the greatest countries in the world and we are very fortunate. Part of recognizing that is recognizing the obligation that we have globally to do a little bit of work around the world.</ParaText>

I travelled a lot as an athlete, but my year at people's doors was a totally new look into what diversity and multiculturalism looks like in Milton. I want to thank all the different communities that welcomed me in whether they were Pakistani, Cameroonian or Nigerian. Whether I was welcomed into their kitchens, churches, temples, gurdwaras, mosques or hockey rinks, it was a really cool experience. I got to know a lot of people from different cultures whom I probably would not have known otherwise.

Co-ops are a solution to poverty, and the Chautauqua Co-op where I grew up is evidence of that. Just in June of this year, my co-op, my home, Chautauqua Co-op, paid off a 35-year mortgage. That means that, for the last 35 years, the Chautauqua Co-op has been providing a safe and secure place for over 80 families to live, every single year.</ParaText>

I sat on the board of directors at a co-op when I was 13 or 14 years old, and I realized that one of the ways that we can relieve poverty is to ensure that there is less profit and that when people pay the rent, they do not need to ensure that somebody else is making a buck. It is a really great solution, and I am always going to be a vocal advocate for co-op housing.</ParaText>

I can honestly say that I would not have competed at the Olympic Games if it were not for co-op housing, and I hope kids in the future will continue to have those opportunities and parents will not have to make tough decisions about putting food on the table or sending their kids to sports. There should not be any financial barriers between a healthy and active lifestyle and the goals and aspirations of Canada's youth.

              <ParaText id="6023213"> Brandon and Chrissy's son has spinal muscular atrophy, and there is a heavy price tag on the treatment for this rare disease. We need pharmacare for Wyatt and other children too, like Chloe, Lennon and Eva, as well as retired adults like my dad. A young girl I met at the door named Chloe has type 1 diabetes. There has to be a solution for young girls like Chloe. A young boy named Liam in my riding has cystic fibrosis, and the medicine costs upwards of $100,000 to treat his disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023214">While it is not directly related to pharma, I heard from parents of autistic kids like Max, Dante and many others, who desperately want to see the federal government take on a national autism strategy. I was heartened to hear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> mention that recently in a speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023215">The highlight of my campaign this summer was actually on the water. I went up to Camp Oochigeas and I sat down for breakfast. Oochigeas provides a camping experience to young kids whose lives have been affected by cancer. I was really excited to see that I was sitting next to a young boy named Matteo, whose mom I met at the doors. Matteo is recovering from cancer. I was thrilled to take him on the water in a canoe. We had a really good day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023216">As an athlete, I worked with my colleagues and teams from other countries for our mutual benefit. Whether people live in Pond Inlet, Nunavut; Prince George, British Columbia; Fredericton, New Brunswick; Trois-Rivières, Quebec; or Milton, Ontario, they deserve a government that is fighting for them and Canada harder than it works for election or re-election. Members will notice that I fit in a riding from each of the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023217">The election is over. It is time that we stop fighting about team red, team orange, team green and team blue, and start fighting for team Canada. We as parliamentarians have an obligation to perform our duties with respect and integrity, and I believe it is possible to disagree without being disagreeable. We ought to conduct ourselves in this distinguished House with conduct becoming of the office that we are all privileged to hold. Sportsmanship is just as important to me in the House as it was on the water. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023242">I am honoured to rise today in response to the Speech from the Throne. It is my first time rising in the House in the 43rd Parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my constituents for putting their faith in me to represent them once again in the House. I truly believe that by working together, we can make all our communities that much better. I thank my team that worked tirelessly day in and day out.

From the bottom of my heart, I say to each and every one of these individuals those two words that we, quite frankly, do not say enough: “thank you”. I would be remiss if I did not extend congratulations to all members who have been elected to represent Canadians in this House and all who ran for those positions in the past year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023244">The Speech from the Throne is a blueprint for the government to show Canadians where we are and where we want to be. It is an opportunity for all of us in the House to discuss with vigour and passion the role and direction of this government, but equally as important, the role of all 338 members of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023245">I look forward to having discussions here today and well into the future with respect to everyone's interests. First is the action on skilled trades. We have made remarkable strides in this area since being elected almost five years ago. However, as we celebrate this achievement, we know there is much more to do. Once again, to progress is by working together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023246">Some provinces and regions across this great nation are struggling to find workers to fill the important positions in our economy that our industries are attempting to fill. My region of Niagara is no exception. Niagara, not unlike other jurisdictions, is beginning to experience a skilled trades shortage. There is a need for welders, pipefitters, boilermakers, seafarers, tile setters, plumbers, technicians, cooks, chefs and other hands-on, hard-working skilled tradespeople.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023247">Thanks to the efforts of the former <Affiliation DbId="229214" Type="4">minister of employment, workforce development and labour</Affiliation>, our government has significantly boosted federal support to the provinces, as well as the territories, by $2.7 billion over six years. This is to help more unemployed, underemployed and those wanting to be retrained to get into the workforce, to strengthen our workforce and, therefore, to strengthen our overall national economy. We have invested $225 million over four years to identify and fill skill gaps in the economy to help Canadians be best prepared for that new economy. Additional investments in collaboration with our partners will see us collectively work to eliminate the skilled trades shortage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023248">We have cut taxes. We have made it more affordable for Canadians. Canadians and this government created the environment for more than one million new jobs in just four years. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023249">With an economy that is strong and with steadily declining debt relative to the size of our economy, Canada now has the best performance and the best balance sheet in the G7. This is thanks to the efforts of all of us, once again working together toward those common goals. Together we have helped 900,000 people out of poverty. At the same time, we know that we need to be prepared for whatever challenges are to come our way in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023250">Our plan will see tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Canadians. This week our government has taken steps to amend the Income Tax Act to lower taxes for the middle class and people working extremely hard to join it. Nearly 20 million Canadians will benefit. This will save a single person close to $300 a year. For families, including families led by a single parent, the savings will be closer to $600 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023251">I have seen first-hand in my riding and throughout the Niagara region the positive impact the Canada child benefit has had on many individuals and many families. Young families are able to afford items like school supplies and sports equipment, and join different organizations. This adds to the quality of life that they well deserve as Canadians. For the very first time, the benefit gives more money every month to nine out of 10 families. It has lifted 300,000 children out of poverty. We will give up to $1,000 more to families to help when the costs of raising kids are the highest by boosting the Canada child benefit by 15% for children under the age of one. We will make sure families get more money right away by making maternity and parental benefits tax-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023252">We have heard today about the new NAFTA supporting trade and strengthening our economy. Thanks must be extended to all the Canadians from every corner of this country, from all walks of life and from all political points of view, who joined this government in this effort. This includes the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It includes the <Affiliation DbId="253392" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It includes the NAFTA Council and the premiers. Regardless of what party's flag is being flown, kudos to each and every one of us working together to come to this achievement. The new NAFTA represents Canadian jobs, in particular in Niagara and certainly for Canada, this great nation. This new agreement will reinforce the strong economic ties between three countries, and support well-paying middle-class jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023253">Transportation and infrastructure are things that are key to the nation, particularly in my riding of Niagara, being a border region. Canada's national transportation infrastructure comprises 26 airports, 18 port authorities, 45,000 kilometres of track and 38,000 kilometres of roadway, as well as our Great Lakes, our St. Lawrence and, once again in our region of Niagara, the Welland Canal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023254">Let us dig a bit deeper into what we have in Niagara that contributes to strengthening the overall Canadian national interests and economy. In Niagara we have the Welland Canal, the Queen Elizabeth Highway, Highway 406, local airports, all located within a one-day's drive of over 44% of North America's annual income. Niagara is a perfect example of how different modes of transport integrating distributional logistics will strengthen our nation's international trade performance. The gateways for trade in goods between Canada and its trade partners are vital. Without them, our strengthened supply chains cannot flow with fluidity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023255">This is why I was honoured to work on the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities throughout the last Parliament, to work together with all parties in the establishment of a Canadian transportation and logistics strategy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023256">I am looking forward to building on the progress that the committee made and will continue to make, such as the alignment of our transportation assets to strengthen, for example, the Great Lakes binational region. This will include the economies, the social and the environmental responsibilities that we have that are attached to the Great Lakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023257">We put forward new abandoned vessel legislation to ensure that polluters will pay for their mess, not middle-class Canadians. We will stand up for Canadian travellers and ensure they are treated with fairness and respect by amending the Transportation Modernization Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023258">We will address key bottlenecks with the national trade corridors fund. Through working together with colleagues on all sides of the House and with Canadians with respect to transport and infrastructure issues in Ottawa, I was also pleased to run on a platform that included creating a national infrastructure fund, funding public transit and ensuring that all municipalities continue to have stable and direct funding for strategies and priorities established by them. This will fund local projects based on the work done by the wonderful teams at the municipal level, the local level, the community level. We will continue to work with members of the House to improve transportation infrastructure for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023259">With respect to housing, we will work hard to address affordability, taking action to invest in affordable housing and make it easier for more people to buy their first home. We have invested millions, for example, in the city of Welland in my riding to build more affordable housing and continue to work with Niagara Regional Housing to ensure we strengthen affordable housing throughout the Niagara region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023260">Fighting climate change is the defining challenge of our time and a defining moment of this Parliament. It is a sentiment shared by Canadians. Canadians overwhelmingly voted in favour of immediate and ambitious action to combat climate change. Our environment is important to all Canadians because without a protected environment, we have no future to live in and even our health could be at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023261">Clean air and clean water are musts in this day and age. New technologies are paramount and need to be created to help us deal with the issue of climate change. We are committed to protecting the environment by setting a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, putting a price on pollution, protecting and conserving nature and reducing plastic pollution within our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023262">We are committed to developing new technologies. We are committed to improving the environment we live in and protecting Canadians from harmful substances. Our government cares about attaining a cleaner and safer environment for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023263">With respect to seniors, Canadians are living longer than ever before. Today's seniors are also facing rising health care costs. The number of seniors who rely on monthly benefits to make ends meet rises as Canadians, our neighbours, our family members and our friends age. We lowered the age of eligibility for old age security from 67 to 65. We moved forward with this change because we know it boosts seniors' retirement savings by thousands of dollars and lets them retire at an earlier age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023264">To make life more affordable for people as they age, we will move forward with an increase in the old age security benefit by 10% for seniors when they turn 75 and will continue to raise it along with inflation. This will help to lift more than 20,000 seniors out of poverty, two-thirds of whom are women, and will give greater financial security to more than three million seniors every year. For most seniors, it will mean up to $729 in additional financial help every year once they reach the age of 75.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023265">We will move forward with more help for seniors who have lost their partners. We will work with the provinces and territories to give even more support to survivors by increasing the Canada pension plan. This increase, worth up to $2,080 in additional benefits every year, will give more than 1.2 million seniors more money and greater peace of mind at a time when they need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023266">I see this in Niagara every day. Whether at Portal Village in the city of Port Colborne, at Villa de Rose in the city of Welland or Cobble Stone Gardens Retirement Residence in the city of Thorold, seniors need investment so they can retire in comfort, as they deserve. Our seniors built this country, they built our communities and they are the foundation, our guides, our place where we learn who we are and where we come from, therefore navigating where we go from here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023267">The Speech from the Throne is a road map for where we want to go in this new Parliament. It is our guide, working for Canadians. Yes, we have work to do. We will keep fighting for families, for our children, for climate action, for seniors, for indigenous communities, for Canada on the world stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023268"> With this in mind, I am looking forward to getting down to work with all 338 members of the House, Canadians with the same interests, finding mechanisms, finding action plans to then satisfy the needs of all 338 ridings throughout this great nation. We can only do this by working together toward the common goals of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023269">We must never underestimate the impact we have on others, our families, friends and neighbours, all of us throughout this great nation. Whether it be from the House of Commons, or within our communities, or representing an organization, or as a member of provincial parliaments or territories, or as mayors, councillors or volunteers, we must never underestimate the impact we have on others. It could be one word, one sentence or one action in a mall, on a sidewalk or in the halls of the House of Commons that can change someone's life forever. The responsibility we have as Canadians is to affect others in a positive way, and we have that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023270"> Within the House, we as parliamentarians must adhere to a mindset of equality for all 338 ridings throughout our great nation. Regardless of who represents those individual ridings or what party they may belong to, we need to meet the expectations of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023271">We are Canada. As President Obama said in the House, “The world needs more Canada.” With that, it is therefore incumbent upon us to ensure we are nationally together strengthening the Canadian values, leading by example in this great nation, but, equally important, internationally, standing shoulder to shoulder as Canadians. However, it starts with vision, followed by working closer together as a stronger nation.

I will even go as far as saying we will look at vision and hearing to be added to that as well.

              <ParaText id="6023292">However, there are other initiatives that our government took that could be called software, such as the investment in the Canada child benefit and the investment in the Canada training benefit. These are sometimes looked at as spending and often we are criticized because of spending items. However, they are in fact investments in the future, because healthy children grow up to be healthy workers. Parents who get the Canada child benefit can afford to invest in RESPs and so forth. Obviously, if workers can retrain, they can get the skills needed to solve the environmental and other scientific challenges we face in this modern and complex world. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023304">Before getting to the subject at hand, I will take advantage of the fact that I have a little more time than I had the last time I spoke to also highlight the contribution of those close to me in this great political adventure. First, I thank the many volunteers who worked countless hours during the election campaign. Everyone here knows how absolutely crucial they are; we are all very aware of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023305">I would also like to mention my trusted collaborator, who has become a friend along the way, which often happens, I think. I am talking about Gisèle, who takes care of everything in the riding with help from the wonderful Andrée-Anne and Marie-Christine. The people of Drummond will be well served.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023306">I also want to highlight an invaluable presence in the lives of politicians: that of our spouses. To be fair, we cannot help but force a certain lifestyle upon them. It takes a great deal of understanding and support on their part to agree to get involved in the turmoil of politics, and sometimes even to pretend to like it. My beautiful wife, Caroline, did not choose to be in politics, but I thank her for accompanying me with great openness and growing enthusiasm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023307">As is the reality for thousands of families in Quebec these days, Caroline and I have a blended family, with a total of four children: Christophe, Alexandrine, Lily-Rose and Tom. With two boys and two girls, we have gender parity. I said “blended family”, which implies a shared parenting arrangement with another parent. I feel compelled to point out how lucky I am to have an ex-spouse who understands the dedication required to be in politics and who takes on more than her share of the responsibilities towards our children, Lily-Rose and Tom, so they do not suffer too much from the repercussions of my new life. I therefore want to thank Marilou and acknowledge the value of the harmonious relationship we have created as parents who are separated. Clearly, this places me in a minority context in my private life, too. I can confirm that things are going well and I am feeling optimistic about this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023308">I want to wrap up my tributes with a few words about a pair of exceptional young people who have been surprisingly impassioned in recent months. I am talking about my parents, Henriette Jolin and Louis Champoux. One should never reveal a lady's age, so I will just say that their combined ages, including months, add up to 159 years. They were so passionate and energetic during the election campaign that I would not be surprised to see them running for office next time around.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023309">I sincerely hope they will not be running against me, and with good reason. My great-grandfather, Émile Fortin, was the MP for Lévis in the 30th Parliament. His son, my great-uncle Louis Fortin, represented Montmagny-L'Islet from 1958 to 1962. He actually took over from Jean Lesage, who left Ottawa for Quebec City. The only generation with no elected officials in my family was my father's, and I am afraid he might suddenly be inclined to remedy that situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023310">All of these people, my family and friends for whom I care deeply, have played vital roles along the way. I would not be here without them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023311">The Speech from the Throne gave us hope that some progress would be made on the issues that matter to Quebeckers. However, there is still a lot of work to do. We need to make sure the government walks the talk, as the saying goes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023312"> In this Speech from the Throne, there was nothing about culture, nothing about language, and nothing about support for the media, in spite of promises made in the 2019 budget. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say, but we are going to make sure that these things do not stay out of mind, and we are going to work hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023313">The Bloc Québécois put out many proposals in the months leading up to the election, and, of course, we continued to promote them on the campaign trail. Those proposals can be found in our platform. To no one's surprise, many of them resonated with our voters, and others also appeared in the throne speech, albeit in bits and pieces. I see this as an open door to discussion and even, in some cases, a good opportunity to work together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023314">Take the tax on web giants. The government has signalled its intention to act swiftly and impose a tax on GAFA, the Googles, Apples, Facebooks and Amazons of the world. That is good, but it is not enough. The proceeds should be considered not as a simple tax, but as a royalty to be distributed to content creators, artists and media outlets. Furthermore, we want 40% of the proceeds to go to francophone content creators and media outlets, not just for Quebec, but for Canada's francophone community as a whole. Francophone culture is at stake. This is no less than a matter of cultural survival.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023315">It is also time to show that we will not wait for the OECD decisions or the whim of the Americans to demand that our creators receive decent compensation for their content. We need to step up and charge web giants GST to put an end to unfair competition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023316">Print media is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. Newspapers are shutting down across the country because web giants are snapping up their advertising revenue once again. There was a 48% drop in advertising revenue between 2003 and 2016, and the situation has not improved over the last three years. The number of subscribers continues to fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023317">Once again, the government is proposing an incomplete plan, but there may be room for improvement. I want to say that we will work together with the community, and with our colleagues in the House who are also concerned about this issue. We will ensure that a plan is developed and implemented to meet the needs of the media industry and its people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023318">However, this print media crisis has hit hard, and we must be very careful, because a similar crisis is brewing for electronic media. Once again, we need to protect our media against the all-powerful GAFA. Our media are active members of our democracy, and even though they may not always make us look good, we must protect their independence and financial health by regulating all media sources fairly, regardless of where they come from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023319">Almost all my colleagues were quick to contact me to talk about problems with fibre optics and cellular coverage when it was announced that I would be my party's communications critic. I became very popular. I even recommend that all those looking for their soulmate put “communications critic” in their profile on dating sites. It works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023320">The federal government provided a program and money, but Quebec already had an effective and efficient program. It would have been much simpler to transfer the money to the Government of Quebec, which would have managed it based on priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023321">Regional Internet is not just a tale. It is the reality for many people, many small businesses and the majority of farmers, who cannot use milking machines, as do many dairy farms. That would allow them to manage their agricultural businesses much more efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023322">Elected officials in absolutely charming small towns such as Saint-Pie-de-Guire and Sainte-Brigitte-des-Saults, or in many other places in the most beautiful of ridings, Drummond, which I recently spoke to you about, would love to attract SMEs or self-employed workers, but Internet access is so unreliable and cellular coverage is so inadequate that they cannot even consider it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023323">It is important to understand, to realize, that access to high-speed Internet is no longer a luxury and then to act accordingly. It is a service that is essential to regional economic development. If we want to attract businesses and create meaningful jobs in the regions, we need to accelerate the process, otherwise we will not succeed and our regions will continue to suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023324">Let me be clear. I am not throwing stones at big business. Companies work within the market parameters imposed on them. It is up to us, however, to ensure that those parameters are adjusted and adapted so that individuals and families are at the heart of our decisions and actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023325">I would like to give a quick example. The municipality of Amherst, Quebec, still has to use a pager service to reach first responders in case of an emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023326">I have appealed to the government about this. The minister listened and showed that he cared about this issue. I even spoke with business people who are currently leaving the municipality. Everyone is open. All stakeholders are open to moving this file forward to enable the people of Amherst to get a more modern and effective system. All that is missing is a little goodwill and the necessary funding. This cannot wait. We cannot leave people in a municipality without access to emergency services. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023327">In light of what I just said, it is clear that Quebec's specificity complicates the government's task in files as complex as culture and communications. That is why the Bloc Québécois will propose the creation of a Quebec CRTC, which would be better able to protect the francophone culture, language and media. Such an organization would also significantly ease the burden on the existing authority and would allow our two distinct cultures to flourish much more freely.</ParaText>

I will say that I know a lot of people who are taking advantage of the extra subsidy the federal government introduced in addition to what the Government of Quebec was already offering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023333">Some files are a lot more complicated and sensitive though. Telecommunications and high-speed Internet access in the regions, for example, might be managed better if responsibility for and oversight of these programs were transferred to the provinces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023335">In 2015, I was working at an NGO in the international development sector, and I was delighted when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that Canada was back. What I did not realize at the time was that Canada was back, way back, in the list of OECD donor countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023336">Today, Canada is in the bottom half of donor countries. Currently, Canada gives approximately a quarter of 1% of gross national income, the lowest we have been at in over 50 years. Embarrassingly, despite the platitudes and good words from the Liberal government, we currently invest even less than the Harper government did in making the world a safer and more prosperous place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023337">Canadians like my constituents in Alberta are proud of Canada's history of punching above its weight on the world stage. When will this government commit to significantly increasing ODA, finally reaching the 0.7%, as promised by Lester B. Pearson and achieved by many countries around the world, including Ireland and Norway?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023346">Since this is my first time speaking in the House, I want to take a moment for acknowledgements. I may not always be as articulate and eloquent as my colleague, because I would rather sing my speech than say it. I am a singer-songwriter, so I would probably be more at ease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023347">I would like to applaud the voters in my riding who honoured our treasured democracy by voting on October 21. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank my campaign volunteers, whose passion and energy are what got me here. I want to thank my loyal husband, Pascal, and my beautiful daughter, Marie-L'Eau, for their unfailing love and support. I love them. They are my guiding lights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023348">I also want to salute the entire arts community of Quebec, especially my fellow singer-songwriters and musicians, who share this passion with me. I think of them as good friends.</ParaText>

They would be so proud to see me represent the voice of Quebec in Parliament. To my large and wonderful family, my countless good friends and the 18,479 people who put their trust in me, I say thank you. I assure you that I am committed to all my constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023350">I was born on a very small bit of land, an island that became famous very early on. The French explorer Jacques Cartier, who had a harsh and trying crossing from Saint-Malo to the new world during his second trip in September 1535, found some land rich with hazelnuts and fish. That is why he named it l'Isle-aux-Coudres, or hazelnut island. Historians have said that this stopover was pivotal to the continuation of his trip to Stadacona, which later became the only francophone national capital of North America, Quebec City.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023351">The islanders are very proud of this slice of history that belongs to them. I will take this opportunity to say hello to everyone, especially my friends, the people of Île-aux-Coudres, the <I>Marsouins</I> and <I>Marsouines</I>. That is what we call the people who live on this island. I will spare my colleagues the story of how this name came about. As a good <I>Marsouine</I>, I will tell you the story at an appropriate time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023352">Île-aux-Coudres has a lovely history full of symbolism, and its motto is that you must know where you come from to know where you are going. Culture is the principal driver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023353">Much later, this same small island continued to make its mark through time and space with the living memory of the islanders in the work of Quebec filmmaker and author, my friend Pierre Perrault. The National Film Board's documentary trilogy <I>La Trilogie de l'Île-aux-Coudres</I> was internationally recognized as a documentary masterpiece and its creator, Pierre Perrault, was recognized as one of the pioneers of direct cinema.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023354">Quebec has something else to be very proud of today. I am proud to highlight some very good news for Quebec, which is again making its mark internationally, despite serious financial difficulties. Quebec does not lack talent. The Hollywood Critics Association just announced that Denis Villeneuve will receive the filmmaker of the decade award at the association's gala on January 9, 2020, for his body of work. We are pleased. This will go a long way to promoting Quebec's film industry abroad. On behalf of all members of this chamber, elected members and members of the Bloc Québécois, I extend our warmest congratulations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023355">I was asked to take on the role of culture critic in Parliament, and I want to question the government about a pressing, topical issue that is sadly missing from the throne speech: the cultural emergency. There is not only a climate emergency, but there is also a cultural emergency. We are in the midst of an unprecedented culture crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023356">Let us talk about this economic, social, historic, traditional and, as we have seen, international force that is culture. Culture sets us apart, defines us as a people and gives us a pointed and relevant view of ourselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023357">Let us think of our writers, historians, novelists, biographers, poets, filmmakers, authors, actors, sculptors, directors, playwrights, circus performers and artisans who are crying out for help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023358">The culture that we love is in economic jeopardy. Our culture brings us freedom and immeasurable social benefits, but all of that is struggling for survival. Why is that? It is because culture relies on the economy, and the economy has experienced massive financial cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023359">Thus, culture and art do not have the resources needed to compete with the web giants around the world. However, some countries around the globe, such as France, Australia and New Zealand, have tackled the problem head-on and have taken action to fix it by taxing the various web platforms. Nothing of the sort is happening here. In Quebec, Netflix calls the shots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023360">Of course, project applications are increasing, and there is no shortage of labour in the industry, but government investments in culture have not kept up. Our wonderful and very popular television shows like <I>Les filles de Caleb</I>, some of which have been on the air for over 20 years and boast ratings of over three million viewers every week, have barely six or seven episodes left and smaller budgets. This is all because Netflix, like many other web giants, is still not paying its fair share of taxes. Our culture is being stifled and swallowed up by American giants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023361">During the election campaign, the government promised to quickly impose a tax of 3% of their total revenue on web giants like Netflix and redistribute those funds to culture. No such commitment was included in the throne speech, which worries us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023362">Large-scale productions can no longer be considered possible in Quebec. We have to stifle our bright ideas because of a lack of resources. What will happen to the joy and beauty that is spread thanks to our culture, not to mention the economic benefits?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023363">In Quebec, the reality is that creators of French-language television content, with their limited financial resources, are being forced to compete with billion-dollar giants equipped with the latest technology and operating under extremely favourable conditions. This leads to the very real consequences we are seeing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023364">We keep going, yes, because we are fighters. In good times or bad, we keep going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023365">That is a very good reason for us to worry and to tell our friends that we will be there to collaborate with our neighbours and promote culture. This will help people like Pierre Perrault, Michel Brault, Gilles Vigneault and Gilles Pelletier, as well as friends closer by like Carol-Anne Pedneault, Daniel Gaudet, Simon Pedneault, Marilyn Castonguay, Claude Gauthier, Jacques Leblanc, Émile Nelligan and Octave Crémazie, succeed in standing out in today's culture.</ParaText>

It is very important for me to express my thanks to my husband Adam and my children Annabelle and William on the birth of Victoria. Their love and their patience go a long way, especially in the middle of a campaign. We all know how sometimes we are not even home for dinner or sometimes to sleep, especially in a rural riding like mine. It is so big and I have to travel from community to community in order to reach constituents.

              <ParaText id="6023388">On the note of door knocking, I spent a lot of time in the riding over the summer, sometimes with the baby in tow. Two weeks after I had her, I was out at events with baby in tow. The things that I heard at the door were sometimes quite sad. In conversations with people, I would ask how they were doing and they would say, “Well, I haven't been laid off yet. I still have a job. I was laid off six months ago and I found another job but I haven't been laid off from it yet.” That is the anxiety and anguish that is being felt in my riding in Saskatchewan. It is the same thing in Alberta. People genuinely are scared about whether they are going to wake up and go to work and still have a job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023389">I live in a very unique city. I have mentioned before in this place that my city actually borders Alberta and Saskatchewan. Half of the residents live in Saskatchewan and half of them live in Alberta. It makes it quite a mess because we are one municipality. It gets very difficult when we have different provincial regulations covering one place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023390">There is a company that employs hundreds if not thousands of people within my riding. The day after the election, October 22, the company laid off 60-some people in my community. That is not including the hundreds of layoffs that happened in Calgary with the same company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023391"> I want to put that into perspective. I do not know if I fully understand going into work one day, thinking it is going to be a normal day and then being told to go home. What kind of conversation would I have with my husband? “Look honey, I was laid off today. I am not sure what we are going to do. I think Christmas is going to look different. I am not sure if we can afford to have the kids in hockey or in dance anymore. Things need to be different.” That is the reality where I live. People, with the struggles that they are dealing with day to day, feel ignored and just wonder if they are going to be able to get by.</ParaText>

He also met with some of the mayors. The mayor of my community was very proactive. He reached out to my office and asked if we had a number for the Prime Minister because he wanted to talk to him. I found the number for the PMO, gave it to the mayor and he made a call. To his surprise, the Prime Minister called him back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023393">I am glad that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took the time to call him back. The mayor stressed that it is important for smaller cities to have a voice as well, not just big city mayors, and important that he hear what is impacting them, especially being in a western province like Saskatchewan. The mayor expressed to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> the struggles of the people in my community and my region in not being able to get their agriculture products to market, for example, their canola, and not being able to get their energy products to market.

              <ParaText id="6023394">What was troubling for me is, was that hope? Was it false hope? Was it a facade? Was it real? Was that conversation real and genuine? People today want authenticity. They want to be listened to. They want to be heard, actually heard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023396">Then came the throne speech, and unless I missed it, I did not hear mention of the Trans Mountain pipeline. I know one thing that would definitely help the constituents in Battlefords—Lloydminster is being able to get gas to market. We heard a lot about the no-more-pipelines bill, Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, and also Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>. Are those bills maybe some of the reasons some people are being laid off, because the atmosphere and environment for energy investment just are not there and it is too restrictive? I did not hear anything in the throne speech on how we are going to help get our oil to market, and maybe lessening the restrictions that have been created in the environment that we have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023397">Also, what is the government's goal right now to help farmers get their products to market? In my riding, there is a lot of farming, whether it is grain or cattle. Farming is one of those things that is year-round as there is always work to be done, but in the off-season, a lot of those farmers are hauling oil and water. They are trucking. They are doing things to pay the bills while they are not able to actively farm. It was really disappointing to hear that the government understood about not being able to get the beef and the canola to market and then hearing that the <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">agriculture minister</Affiliation> missed the deadline to file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023398">It saddens me because I thought the government was listening harder. I thought, in good faith, that because of those conversations and phone calls the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was having with premiers and mayors across the country that something would come out of it. I am so sorry to say that my disappointment with this throne speech is just overwhelming in that real actions were not taken to help reduce and alleviate the western alienation that is happening.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023402">Mr. Speaker, in the member's speech, what I did not hear enough about is seniors. Many seniors in our communities are struggling to make ends meet due to increased housing costs and medicines they cannot afford. We hear of seniors cutting pills in half or making a choice as to whether they will buy food or medicine, and living in pain, which is unacceptable. Some seniors cannot even pay for their basic needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023403">The government promised that it would increase the OAS for seniors by 10% for those who are over 75 and increase the CPP by 25% for widows. We do not think that is enough to meet the cost of living today. The government did not allow people between 65 and 75 to benefit from its offer. We do not understand that. It seems that people who are 65 should have the same benefits as those who are 75 when they are retired, especially single women. In this country, over 30% of single women over 65 live in poverty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023410">I have had the privilege of serving in this great House in a previous Parliament. Given that I represent a constituency in Atlantic Canada as a Conservative, members know that there is a gap in my political employment history. It is a rare honour to be elected to Parliament. It is an honour to serve and be sent here by constituents to represent them. For this, I thank the voters of New Brunswick Southwest for sending me back. The one promise I made during the election was to work hard every day to represent the voice of my constituents.

It was a difficult moment for many of us at the start of that election campaign. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023413">For those of us who have had the privilege of sitting on either side of the House with him, and for those who might know Greg only through Hansard, I can say this. Everything that was said about Greg is true. Greg did not do anything in half measures. Greg was never afraid to stand up, never afraid to speak out for his constituents. He truly represented the very best of us. My commitment is to follow Greg Thompson's high standard. Perhaps I will not always hit it, but I know at least I will always be on the right path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023414">In considering today's news, I wish to also acknowledge our Conservative leader. He is a friend, he is a good man and, importantly, he understands Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023415">In the last Parliament, when the federal government failed to appoint a minister for our region's economic development portfolio, when we nearly lost our seat on the Supreme Court, and when 32 Liberal MPs sat quietly, it was the federal Conservative leader and it was all Conservatives who defended those important priorities for Atlantic Canada. As well, it was Conservatives from outside the region who fought for the energy east pipeline, more so than New Brunswick Liberal MPs did in the last Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023416">Failing to stand up for home is why the Liberals lost 40% of their seats in New Brunswick and they nearly lost the majority of them. We will win them next time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023417">I turn now to the matter at hand, the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023418">In several places, the Speech from the Throne talks about a mandate, yet this is very much a hung Parliament. Canadians gave no party a mandate, except a mandate to try to work together. The Liberals won the most seats, but won fewer votes than the Conservatives. The debate will continue, and a wise government will look to work collaboratively with other parties. Let me begin in a spirit of harmony or agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023419">I support the idea of cutting income taxes for Canadians. It is important to make home ownership more affordable for Canadians. It is important that governments' help families get ahead. The idea of providing clean water to indigenous communities is also important. We need to do more to tackle opioid abuse and as well, do more to help people battling mental health issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023420">The government also needs to reduce red tape. We also need to work together on the NAFTA file, the free trade file, although on this one the government is getting off on the wrong foot already.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023421">Those are the areas of the throne speech where I think we can find common cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023422"> Notably, the throne speech was silent on aquaculture and the traditional fisheries. This was a good thing, given the reckless promises made by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> during the heat of the recent election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023423">Unfortunately, there are also a whole host of areas where we are on the wrong path. The ACOA minister continues to be a member from outside of our region. When it comes to scientific research dollars, innovation and R and D funding, the lion's share of that money ends up in areas outside of Atlantic Canada, which has a harmful economic impact on Atlantic Canada and areas outside of central Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023424">On rural Internet, the government is simply moving too slowly and is too focused on the big telecoms for solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023425"> The government continues to target law-abiding, responsible firearm owners, not illegal guns and gangs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023426"> Additionally, it has been equally silent on the forestry industry and on its inability to get an agreement with the United States in this regard. This is important for Canada as well as New Brunswick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023427"> On deficits and rising taxes, all too often the Liberals' focus is elsewhere, and they have not made deficit elimination a priority, which they have promised to do time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023428">I will discuss the two most pressing areas where we are going to have a challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023429"> The first is the carbon tax. Workers at Flakeboard in my riding lost their jobs because of policies brought in by the government which raised energy prices. Marwood, another company, is a builder of wood products, with sales at home in Canada and in New England. It, too, is deeply concerned about the impact of ever-rising energy prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023430">As well, the economy is sluggish. We have heard that 71,000 jobs were lost in November, and we are falling behind our international competitors. Last year, real gross domestic product expanded by 1.4% and population grew by 1.5%, which means on a per capita basis, things are shrinking. They are getting worse for Canadians and the economy. As a result, wages for working Canadians are not keeping up with the prices on just about everything. I will have more to say on this in the coming weeks and months in my role as the opposition labour critic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023431">Over these four years, we have seen one constant thing from the government. It has no discipline, and this has led to a decline for the entire country. This is true on the economy, it is true with our international standing, it is true with our institutions and now it is true on national unity. The Liberals are not a serious government. Canadians gave the government a humbling return in this Parliament. Unfortunately, I do not think it is enough to change its direction, so Conservatives will continue to offer a better course for Canada and a way forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023447"> Especially in those northern areas, we develop our resources. This is a government that said it is supposedly pro-north, but it is difficult to defend that. I will mention one thing that was very clear. Having a northern development strategy would have been good to hear. A national energy corridor to help get our resources to market would have been a great thing to hear in the throne speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023448">A plan to restore ethics and accountability in the government is a general theme that we did not hear about. As the former chair of the ethics committee, I certainly know how lacking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is on that file. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023449">There was also the lack of support for our energy workers, such as building the TMX, repealing Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>. We did not hear about those either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023450">Why does that relate to the north? A lot of the natural resource projects are in the north. All that we have seen, even when we talk about Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, is the Liberals really limit any new development in the northern part of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023451">It is not just the Conservatives who are saying this. We have leaders in the north who have already criticized the Liberal government. I will mention some of those individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023452">Former Nunavut premier Peter Taptuna said, “We do want to be getting to a state where we can make our own determination of our priorities, and the way to do that is gain meaningful revenue from resource development. At the same time, when one potential source of revenue is taken off the table, it puts us back at practically square one where Ottawa will make the decisions for us.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023453">I am referring to the moratorium on development in the north by the Liberal government. At the time, the leaders in the north were not made aware of that and it was very much a surprise. We have indigenous peoples across the north who want to develop their resources and a good economy for their people and for their benefit. What we saw from the government was a complete stifling of that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023454">Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq said, “No one in Nunavut asked for a carbon tax and no one in Nunavut agreed to it.” That is another aspect of what this particular leadership has addressed, which is the effects of the carbon tax on the north. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023455">I live in northern B.C. and the member for <Affiliation DbId="253050" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> across the way lives where it is a little colder than where I live. One thing I would think the Liberal member across the way can agree on is that heating our homes in the north really is not an option. It is not a luxury and it is not something we can choose not to do. We need to heat our homes just to stay alive in the winter months. That is why the carbon tax especially targets the north unfairly. I would have at least expected some kind of way to mitigate that effect on northern communities. They really have no choice, whether it is transportation or heating their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023456">I am going to mention another leader, Merven Gruben, mayor of the hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk. It is a long quote, but I will read it for the benefit of members today. He said, “I agree the Liberals should be helping us. They shut down our offshore gasification and put a moratorium right across”, and I will use his language, “the whole freaking Arctic without even consulting us.” It might show his anger too with this decision. Obviously, they were expecting to develop those resources to help their people and it was stymied and shut down right there. He further stated, “They never said a word to us.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023457">Mayor Gruben's colleague said, “It's so easy to sit down here and make judgments on people and lives that are 3,500 klicks away, and make decisions on our behalf, especially with that moratorium on the Beaufort. That should be taken away, lifted, please and thank you. That is going to open up and give jobs to our people—training and all the stuff we're wishing for.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6023458">Merven Gruben also made another key statement, saying, “We're proud people who like to work for a living.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023459">This is the opportunity they are looking for. They want to develop their resources, yet the government, which is supposed to be supporting the north, seems to be doing everything to get in the way of that development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023460">Mr. Merven Gruben also said:</ParaText>

We all know that’s not the money and work that we were used to in the oil and gas days that we liked.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023462">All that said, we are talking about the throne speech tonight. One thing I have not mentioned yet that alarms us in the north is the lack of a softwood lumber agreement. It is affecting many of the communities across the north.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023463">We talked about gasification and oil and gas and referred a bit to mining, but there are great jobs in the forestry industry as well. There is lots of timber in the north. A lot of areas have not been logged for many years and the timber is sitting there, affecting hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. It would greatly benefit the north if we signed a softwood lumber agreement. Even a signal from the Liberals that they wanted to get this done would have been appreciated by the folks in my riding and in the north, but we did not even get a signal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023464">As the House probably remembers, the last time this happened the government at least signalled. Maybe it is better for the Liberals not to say it; maybe that is where they are now. They did not even talk about a softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023465">The last time we heard about it was in 2015. In the first 100 days, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was supposed to sit down with the then President Obama and get a signed, sealed and delivered softwood lumber agreement. That did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023466">Some have asked what the big deal is. The big deal is that the 20% tariff applied to our Canadian lumber has greatly affected the margins. A couple of years ago when we were making $600 per thousand, it was still profitable, but with the market going down and stumpage rates affecting us in northern British Columbia, the 20% tariff is now really affecting the sale of lumber and timber to our neighbours. Despite this, it was once again ignored by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023467">As a bottom line, the throne speech signals the direction the government is supposed to be going. We do not see a whole lot for the north or the softwood lumber industry. The Liberals are working on language to talk back Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>. They seem to be ramping it up. We heard what the <Affiliation DbId="253376" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> was talking about. There is gas project in B.C., another northern project, and one of the project partners is pulling out. Is that because of the carbon tax in Canada? Is that because of other signals the environment minister has given that the Liberals will not co-operating with that particular project? I do not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023468">The bottom line is that Canadians need to work. Canadians in the north, in the file that I now represent, need to work. They need to be able to heat their homes, feed their families and keep a roof over their heads. It is unfortunate that the government does not seem to take that group of Canadians seriously.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6023497">Mr. Speaker, I want to take a short moment to thank everyone in Edmonton Strathcona for electing me as a new member of Parliament. Edmonton Strathcona is a very special riding, home to great festivals, a thriving art scene, many post-secondary institutions, the francophone community, the Old Strathcona Farmers' Market, a beautiful river valley and so much more. I am incredibly honoured to be able to represent the people of Edmonton Strathcona in this House, and I am deeply grateful to everyone who helped elect me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023498">I want to particularly thank the wonderful team of staff and volunteers who supported my campaign, people like Erica, Gale, Tom, Epiphany, Eleanor, John and so many others who worked so hard. I would like to say a special thanks to my good friends Scott Parker and Megan Rich for being such incredible supports for me and for our campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023499">I would also like to take a moment to thank my family: my parents, my brothers and my wonderful children, Maclean and Keltie, and my husband Duncan, for supporting me and sharing me with my constituents and with the House. My gratitude to those who have supported me on this journey is immense, and it serves as fuel for my commitment and dedication to advocate on behalf of the citizens of Edmonton Strathcona and all Albertans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023500">We have a problem. On Monday, I asked the government what it was doing to support Albertans who have lost their jobs and cannot find work. I asked the government how it intends to support the over 20% of young men in Alberta who are unemployed. I asked the government how it was going to show, with actions not words, that it understands what is happening in Alberta and how it would show that it would do the right thing and fight alongside my colleagues and me to ensure that every Albertan has a good, family-sustaining job and that hard-working Albertans are equipped to work in the new economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023501">I am proud to be the granddaughter of Daniel McCoy, one of the infamous McCoy brothers, who were pioneers in Alberta oil and gas. My husband and brother work in the sector, as did my father before his retirement. As with so many Albertans, my family's story is woven together with oil and gas. Like other families, I profoundly and personally understand what is at stake here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023502">For many years, Albertans benefited from the oil and gas industry, and the rest of Canada benefited from the wealth produced by Alberta workers. This wealth paid for health care, social programs and other initiatives that improved the lives of all Canadians. We were happy to contribute to a greater good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023503">Albertans need support for economic diversification, green energy, energy efficiency and transportation infrastructure. Albertans need employment, education and training support. Albertans need jobs. In November alone, over 18,000 jobs were lost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023504">Under Rachel Notley, Alberta took significant steps toward diversifying its economy and fighting climate change. Unfortunately, the province is now going backwards. Is the government prepared to offer real solutions to Albertans? Is it prepared to make serious investments in infrastructure, green energy and transportation, and in employment and education supports for Alberta workers?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023510">We know, as we move forward as a country, that we have to include all Canadians and ensure that everyone has a real and fair chance to succeed. This government worked hard in the last Parliament to support Albertans who are going through tough times, and we will continue to do so in this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023511">We recognize the challenges facing workers in our resource sector. With the lower prices on international commodities, there have been some very difficult times for workers, particularly in the prairies. That is why, after many years of trying and failing by previous governments, we are moving forward on building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. There are shovels in the ground and thousands of Canadians hired to make sure that we can get our energy resources to new markets responsibly and sustainably. Our government is about partnering with westerners to develop the west's economy and advance its economic interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023512">I am from the prairies. I have lived most of my life in the prairies. I am a University of Calgary graduate. I worked with farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba over many years, and I know that westerners want to be heard and seen. Let me assure the hon. member that this government is listening and acting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023513">Our priority is to spur innovation, diversification and economic growth in communities across Canada, including Alberta. One key way our government supports Alberta is through the regional development agency focused on the west: Western Economic Diversification Canada, or WD for short.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023514">Through WD, the federal government is partnering with Albertans and other western businesses and entrepreneurs to harness their skills and ingenuity. This partnership helps create the business environment and opportunities that will grow the economy. WD offers support to businesses that are starting up, want to scale up or need help getting their products and services to international markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023515">Earlier this year, after engaging with westerners, WD developed the western Canada growth strategy. Grow West is a whole-of-government effort to build on a solid climate for investors, support small and medium-sized businesses and connect western enterprises to export markets and offshore supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023516"> As recently as September of 2019, our government announced over $27 million in new investments for 23 projects across the city and surrounding areas. Over $18 million was provided through business scale-up and productivity funding, which will support small and medium-sized businesses in Edmonton by providing interest-free loans for these projects. Another $6 million was announced through the regional innovation ecosystems program for projects in Edmonton, supporting a diverse range of innovations in advanced manufacturing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023517">This government's support for Alberta does not stop there. However, I have a little too much to say and too little time, so I will end by saying that this government will continue to invest in Alberta and Albertans, because we know that when Alberta does well, Canada does well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023527">I would also thank my two best canvassers. I had a gentleman by the name of Jerry Steadman. He was 74 years old and knocked on over 10,000 doors for me. My second-best canvasser was at the other end of the age spectrum. He was six years old and happens to be my son. I am not sure how many members have had the opportunity to door knock with someone like James, but it was a different opportunity. NDP and Green supporters would invite me into their homes, give my child chocolate bars and offer their support. To James and Jerry I offer great thanks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023528">I will mention a couple of issues going on in my constituency right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023529">My constituency borders the wonderful waters of Lake Ontario. Along that shoreline the water is very high, and people are afraid, as the spring comes, that what happened the last couple of years will repeat: extreme flooding and property damage. I will continue to advocate for them and am concerned for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023530">The other issue my constituents are worried about is rural Internet. Our children's ability to learn is impeded by slow Internet speed. Businesses' progress and success in rural Ontario are being impeded because we do not have the Internet speed necessary for a modern business environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023531">With that, I will get to my question. Last Friday, the government accepted Alberta's environmental plan. While the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> committed in the throne speech to working with other provinces, the good people of Ontario are still left waiting. Ontario has a balanced approach to the environment, promoting jobs and leading our country in job creation over the last couple of months, while also reducing emissions. Ontario is a national leader in greenhouse gas emission reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023532">When will the Liberals stop playing games and give Ontario an answer? Will it be in a day, will it be in a month, will it be in a year or at any time on the space-time continuum?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023535">The vast majority of Canadians voted for climate action in this past election, and our government is committed to moving forward with measures that will reduce our emissions and grow a clean economy. I look forward to working with all members in this place as we identify and move forward with solutions to tackle climate change. The Speech from the Throne made it very clear that our government will work with provinces and territories to find solutions, especially when it comes to climate change. Why? It is because Canadians are already feeling the impacts of climate change, from wildfires in the west to extreme flooding in the east. The costs of climate change are growing. I know this all too well, representing a riding that has experienced record flooding two out of the last three years.</ParaText>

Canadians also recognize that when it is free to pollute, there will be more of it. That is why they support a price on carbon pollution. A growing number of governments and experts understand that carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools we have for tackling climate change and growing the clean economy. It incents Canadians to make clean choices, it helps to reduce emissions and it stimulates investments in climate action, including adaptation and clean innovation. That is why pricing carbon pollution is an essential part of our climate plan. The climate plan we developed with the provinces and territories offers them the flexibility to price carbon pollution in a way that makes sense for their circumstances. It also establishes a common standard to ensure that those plans are straight, stringent and effective, because establishing minimum national standards is integral to reducing nationwide greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023537">We have worked hard to develop a price on carbon pollution pricing system that is practical and affordable, and that ensures Canadians are better off. When carbon pollution pricing went into effect across Canada, we ensured that all proceeds would be returned to the jurisdiction of origin. In fact, in the provinces and territories where the federal carbon pricing system is in place, such as Ontario, most families are getting more than they pay. This year, for example, an Ontario family of four received about $307 through the climate action incentive. Our plan demonstrates that we can tackle climate change, while at the same time leaving families better off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023538">As part of our plan, we also have an annual benchmarking assessment process. We asked the provinces and territories to provide information on their carbon pricing systems to determine whether they meet the federal standard. We have received Ontario's proposal to implement its own provincial carbon pollution pricing system for heavy industry, and we are assessing that proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023539">One of our priorities in putting a price on carbon pollution has been ensuring stability and certainty for businesses and investors. This ensures businesses can plan for the future. That is why the federal benchmark lays out a path for carbon pricing until 2022, and that is why we take any changes to the system for industrial emitters very seriously. The federal carbon pollution pricing system is in place in Ontario, and it is working. We are looking at Ontario's proposal, but we are doing our due diligence to make sure that carbon pricing remains stringent and effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023540">We will continue to work with all jurisdictions, businesses, and indigenous peoples to advance the climate action Canadians expect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023542">There is another question that I would put for the member. The Parliamentary Budget Officer, the Green Party and others would agree with me in saying the carbon tax is not effective at current rates. We would say from this side that we should invest in technology and global investments that will actually affect the global problem. They would say that we would need to double, triple or quadruple the carbon tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6023544">Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate. We worked with provinces, territories and indigenous communities and businesses for two years to develop an approach to carbon pricing that worked for the different regions in our vast country. We have worked to ensure that it would be fair, effective and meet minimum stringency requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6023545">In response to my hon. colleague's question, we will review the Government of Ontario's proposal, alongside the proposals of other provinces and territories, as quickly as possible. Protecting the environment and growing the economy go together. We will continue to work with provinces and territories to advance climate action while supporting good local jobs and making life more affordable for families.</ParaText>
